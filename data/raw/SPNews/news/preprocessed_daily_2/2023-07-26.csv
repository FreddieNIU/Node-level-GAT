It has amassed assets over $6.89 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Small Cap ValueThere's a lot of potential to investing in small cap companies, but with market capitalization below $2 billion, that high potential comes with even higher risk.Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners.CostsInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.44%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 20.80% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Visteon Corp (VC) accounts for about 0.44% of total assets, followed by Ssc Government Mm Gvmxx (GVMXX) and Sylvamo Corp (SLVM).The top 10 holdings account for about 3.04% of total assets under management.Story continuesPerformance and RiskFNDA seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Small Co.

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into second quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the third quarter of 2023. Starting with a quick overview of the quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $4.5 billion, an increase of 3% sequentially and a decrease of 13% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 18%, Embedded Processing grew 9%, and our Other segment declined 10% from the year-ago quarter. Now, I'll provide some insight into our second quarter revenue by market. During the quarter, we experienced continued weakness across all markets, except automotive. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance, as it is more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was about flat. Next, the automotive market was up low single digits. Personal Electronics was up low single digits after several quarters of sequential declines. And next, Communications Equipment was down mid-teens. And finally, Enterprise Systems was down mid-single digits. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?Story continuesRafael R. LizardiThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, second quarter revenue was $4.5 billion, down 13% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.9 billion, or 64% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, increased capital expenditures and the transition of LFAB-related charges to cost of revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 540 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $938 million, up 12% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.6 billion, or 19% of revenue. Operating profit was $2 billion in the quarter, or 44% of revenue, and was down 28% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $1.7 billion, or $1.87 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion in the quarter and $7.4 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.4 billion in the quarter and $4.2 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $3.2 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased about $80 million of our own stock. In total, we have returned $6.5 billion in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.6 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we repaid $500 million of debt and issued $1.6 billion of debt. Total debt outstanding was $11.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.5%. Inventory dollars were up $441 million from the prior quarter to $3.7 billion and days were 207, up 12 days sequentially. For the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.36 billion to $4.74 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.68 to $1.92. Lastly, we continue to expect our 2023 effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.Dave PahlThanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.Vivek AryaI had a high-level question, which is, when I compare DI sales growth right down almost 13%, 14% in the near term, down double digit versus peers is significantly below. And when I look at your trailing 12-month free cash flow of sub-17%, if my model is right, that is the lowest since 2010. But at what point will TI say that something needs to change in the strategy to help close the gap on the growth side and to help free cash flow margins get back to the trend line? So I understand that, obviously, you're not optimizing the model for just 1 year. But now, we have seen just consistent decline in free cash flow per share, which is your preferred metric. So at what point should we start to see free cash flow get back to historical trends?Rafael R. LizardiYes. So thanks, Vivek. Let me start, and Dave, if you want to chime in. But big picture, a step back to what we told you during capital management, and the investments that we're making are long term in nature, as you alluded to in your question, and we are going to enable revenue growth for the company for the next 10 to 15 years. Okay? So that's how we're thinking about it. And that's why we're making these investments on CapEx, in particular, about $5 billion per year for the next 4 years. And we are committed to those investments. We're excited to making those investments regardless of the short-term fluctuations of revenue. And of course, lower revenue means lower operating cash, which now, with the CapEx -- that's what you're seeing on the free cash flow, it's not unexpected.Dave PahlYes. And maybe I'll just add that, Vivek, as you know and have followed us for some time, one of our competitive advantages is manufacturing and technology. So these CapEx investments really are strengthening that advantage over time. It's fairly obvious that that -- those investments will allow us to produce products at significantly lower cost when -- to service demand. And controlling those assets in today's world is increasingly important. So customers can see the investments that we're making. Not only with that, the other systems that we've got to make it easier to do business with us, combined with the inventory we're putting in place to support their growth and customer reaction is extremely positive to that. So we believe these will be great investments for all of us long term. Do you have a follow-on?Vivek AryaYes. I guess maybe, to say -- ask the same question but in a different way, right? And with respect -- I mean, TI had the same strategy 2 or 3 years ago also, but we saw sales grow worse than peers last year. And sales are again growing worse than peers this year. So it's not a 1 quarter or 2 quarter phenomena. Sales have been undergrowing your peer group for almost 2 years now. And CapEx is growing while sales are declining. So that's why I'm questioning whether the strategy is still right, whether the results are actually justifying the strategy?Dave PahlYes, I'll start, and Rafael, if you want to add. Again, we've talked about is share doesn't move quickly inside of our markets. I think that depending on the period you're comparing to, oftentimes, the market exposure can explain a good portion of it. There's other factors, like how much distribution is someone using. As you know, we've transitioned from mostly using distribution to mostly having revenue come direct. So there was inventory that needed to be burned out of the channel as we made that transition. So there's multiple factors. I think going forward, our confidence in being able to continue to gain share is extremely high. Customer reaction to the capacity that they know they need to have, wanting to know that they've got capacity runway, not from someone's manufacturing supplier, but directly from someone that makes their products, is -- really resonates with customers.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.Toshiya HariMy first one is on your Q3 guidance. You're guiding revenue up 1% sequentially. Dave, you called out automotive as the one end market that continues to be healthy. But anything to point out or any standouts as you think about the sequential trajectory from Q2 to Q3? Or is it a continuation of what you saw in Q2?Dave PahlYes. I'll just point out that this last quarter, we saw weakness across the board in our markets with the exception of automotive, like you've called out. And just to point out that that continued asynchronous behavior, we had PE weaken back in second quarter a year ago. And the other markets followed, but obviously, the exception of that with automotive continued to be strong. And it's up over 20% year-on-year. So definitely very strong growth there. And as we look into third quarter, we're not expecting to see any significant change in our end markets compared to this last quarter. Do you have a follow-on?Toshiya HariI do. So inventory on your balance sheet was up, I think, 13% sequentially. Days grew to 207. I know on your capital management call, you revised up the upper range of your target to more than 200. I also appreciate, Dave, the transition from disti to direct. But at what point do you think you need to cut production or cut utilization rates and start to manage down inventory? Are you still comfortable with where things are today?Rafael R. LizardiYes. No, thanks for the question, Toshiya. Yes, we are comfortable where we are. As a reminder, our objective for inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service and minimize obsolescence. I would point you to Slide 13 at our capital management call. That shows the semiconductor cycle over many years, over about 30-some years in what that informs us on what could happen in the future. And we're planning for the long-term growth through those cycles, not in any one quarter or even any one year. And of course, inventory levels always depend on demand expectations. And for the time being in the near term, they will likely have an upward bias.Toshiya HariOkay. So just to clarify, you're still running your fabs full at this point?Rafael R. LizardiUtilization this last quarter was lower than the previous quarter. That was largely a function of adding capacity.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.Stacy Aaron RasgonFor my first one, just to follow up on that. You said inventories have an upward bias. So that means inventory like dollars and days you expect to increase again in Q3?Rafael R. LizardiWell, the days depend on revenue, of course, but on the dollars -- has an upward bias. So there's very likely that the dollars will go up in Q3. Of course -- and you know this is right, but inventory is on the balance sheet at one point in time, but it's meant to support the future growth, and 200 days is about couple of quarters' worth of inventory in various stages of finish.Stacy Aaron RasgonHow many quarters are they going to keep going up for, though?Rafael R. LizardiThat's going to depend on revenue expectations, beyond now and then, the decisions that we make on the factory, and we forecast one quarter at a time. Just know that our thinking, it's long term in nature, as I talked -- as I mentioned to Toshiya in the previous call. And we're managing through the cycles, right? So not what's going to happen in one quarter or even 2 quarters, what we think is going to happen over longer than that on inventory. On capacity, we're adding capacity that's going to support us for many years, right? So it's going to give us plenty of headroom. One more comment on inventory, just for those who maybe have not listened to us very often, but you know there's -- our inventory has very low obsolescence. The bulk of it is for catalog parts that -- the inventory itself last year is, in fact, up to 10 years on the shelf, but the product life cycles are very long with our customers, and we have, in many cases, tens or dozens of customers that buy the product. So the risk of obsolescence is very low in the dollar.Dave PahlOkay. Thank you, Stacy. We'll go to the next caller, please.Stacy Aaron RasgonOh. Was that my...Dave PahlThat was your second -- Yes, thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citigroup.Christopher Brett DanelyThanks, guys. And by the way, thanks for having a nice, concise conference call. It's unique in semis and much appreciated. My first question is just on lead times and shortages. Given all the capacity you're adding in the inventory, can we pretty much say that TI lead times are the lowest, at least among peers and the shortages are all gone? Are we pretty much, I guess, ""back to normal?"" And I mean, are there any metrics that you could share with us sort of now versus 3 or 6 months ago on the improvement there?Dave PahlYes. Chris, what I would -- how I would frame it today is we've got -- the vast majority of our products are available on ti.com for immediate shipment. And as Rafael talked about, whenever the upturn does come, we'll have product available as well as capacity behind that to be able to support that demand.Now if a customer wants to give us an order at lead time, those lead times over the cycle haven't changed that much. So they can place that order or if they need inside of that, they can -- for the vast majority of the products, have it available. Now we do have hotspots. We'll probably always have a place where we have a demand and supply imbalance. But those hotspots are closing and closing pretty quickly. As Rafael talked about, we're bringing on capacity every quarter. So that just gives us more flexibility to be able to meet the customer demand. But it does vary beyond what we've got on hand. Do you have a follow-on?Christopher Brett DanelyYes, earlier in the call and in a bunch of the calls, you keep talking about your advantages in manufacturing and given you have more internal manufacturing and more 300-millimeter than the competitors. Are you -- I guess, are you guys getting a little more aggressive on price? Are you able to price below the competition? Is this something that has happened recently? Some of your competitors have, I guess, ""complained"" about TI getting more aggressive in price recently. I just wanted your response to that.Dave PahlYes. Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. Our pricing strategy hasn't changed. And of course, we regularly monitor with the pricing of all of our products, and we may maintain the goal to continue to gain share over time. But there's nothing unusual going on with pricing today. And I'll point out the fact that when we opened up our Fab 1, we had 75% of the tools needed inside of that factory, and there was handwringing back then if you remember that we were going to do something unnatural. And what we talked about was putting in place that capacity to support growth, and that's what it did. So thank you, Chris, we'll go to the next caller.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.Harlan L. SurYes. Up until the March quarter, the team had seen 3 consecutive quarters of increasing cancellations and pushouts, sort of the typical sort of customer behavior in a weak demand environment. Did the team continue to see cancellations and pushout activity expanding in the June quarter? Or have you guys -- or have you or are you seeing signs of stabilization?Dave PahlYes. The way I describe that is the cancellations remain at elevated levels. And we believe that customers are continuing to work down inventories to get that more in line with their demand. Do you have a follow-on?Harlan L. SurYes. Thanks for that. So your Embedded business continues to hold up very well, right? I think trailing 12 months, it's up 9% year-over-year versus your Analog business, which is down 7%. I know part of it is due to the strategy, the refocusing of the MCU businesses over the past few years. More general purpose, catalog-focused, right? But it also seems to be reflecting this broader trend in the industry, if I look at the SIA data, if I look at you and your other MCU competitors, where -- industry MCU trends year-over-year are holding up much, much better versus the analog. I just wanted to get the team's perspective on why the large delta in performance Analog versus Embedded?Dave PahlYes. Yes, thanks for that question, Harlan, and how you framed it. I would say at a top level, the changes that we have made to our product portfolio, the design in that and the customer response to those products as we've put them out in the marketplace continues to be very strong. Our confidence that that business will grow and gain market share over the long term is extremely high based on that. And as we've talked about before, we're putting in place to be able to support that growth for Embedded internally, and that is a position that we haven't been in quite some time. Near term, I would say, besides things stabilizing, we've experienced greater supply constraints over the last 2 years as Embedded has previously had to rely on foundries to supply that demand. And so those constraints are alleviating. And I think that that's just something that you see across the industry. So thank you, Harlan. And we'll go to the next caller.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.Blayne Peter CurtisI just wanted to go back to the decision. I mean, I understand the inventory is not going to be obsolete, but it's eventually going to kind of steal from your future ability to scale gross margins. So I mean, at the current run rate, you're kind of building at like a $23 billion run rate, and it's going to only increase next year. So what's the harm in pulling it back a bit? I'm just trying to understand an interim here, just pulling back utilizations and not building so much inventory.Rafael R. LizardiIn the big scheme of things, our goal here is to support revenue growth. It's not, frankly, to optimize short-term fluctuations in gross margins. Those are not irrelevant, of course, but it's just the focus is on supporting revenue growth in the short term, midterm and long term. And inventory supports short-term to midterm fluctuations, right, that we can mitigate. We're having plenty of inventory. And the incremental cost of inventory is really low. As we talked about, on the obsolescence side, also on the variable cost nature of what goes into inventory. So it's just sort of just things that we keep in mind when -- in trying to make those decisions.Blayne Peter CurtisYes. I just wanted to ask on gross margins. I mean, I know you don't give perfect color, but it seems like it's down at least 150 basis points sequentially. Maybe consumers are mixed. But I'm just kind of curious, is it just depreciation layering in? Or is there any other puts and takes on gross margin?Rafael R. LizardiSo I assume you're talking about third quarter? So yes, our guidance, and as you pointed out, we only give topline and EPS. But our guidance is the best estimate that we have in our gross margins -- or I'm sorry, that guidance embeds -- the revenue is flat in that particular case, and it embeds the result in depreciation and other related costs from added capacity over time. On a year-on-year basis, I know you asked sequentially, but just a reminder, on a year-on-year basis, keep in mind that last year, we had the Lehi acquisition fab cost in restructuring, and now it is in COR, in cost of revenue as of December of last year when you move.Dave PahlYes. So yes, so year-on-year, the change in revenue, the increase in -- or moving of the cost from the restructuring into -- most of that into cost of revenue. And as well as depreciation. So thank you, Blayne.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen.Joshua Louis BuchalterI guess I wanted to follow up on the previous one and ask about -- we understand that the depreciation flow through, that it is what it is. But can you maybe talk through some of the near- to medium-term milestones when the 300-millimeter increased output, could start to benefit gross margin and sort of help offset the depreciation headwinds?Rafael R. LizardiYes. Just -- what I would tell you is depreciation, the way we depreciate equipment is over 5 years. Buildings is much longer, usually they average about 30 years or so. But consider that that equipment lasts a lot longer than 5 years, right? We have factories today that are running on 50 years-plus. And some of that has upgraded equipment. But broadly speaking, that equipment lasts for decades, not the 5 years where we depreciate it. So it's probably an unfair comparison to try to put the 300 benefit next to the depreciation and expect an offset in the short term. I would suggest you think of it from a cash standpoint. We're investing that CapEx. It's cash. Forget about the depreciation, is -- CapEx is what we're investing. That's going to enable growth by adding that internal capacity, which, as Dave alluded to earlier, that is geopolitically dependable capacity. We're putting as many as 4 fabs in Sherman, 2 in Richardson, 2 in Lehi in Utah. And then assembly test facilities in Asia, primarily Malaysia and Philippines, for example. So that's going to put us in a really great position to grow the topline for a long time. And then what happens there is that that yields a lot of operating cash for our company that then we can either redeploy or return to the owners of the company after those investments.Dave PahlDo you have a follow-on, Josh?Joshua Louis BuchalterYes, sure. I recognize the language is similar last quarter regarding the end market commentary. But did anything change? Any better or worse intra-quarter? And in particular, personal electronics grew, you've talked in the past about it sort of being a 4-quarter cycle. Is it safe to say that that's sort of bottom now?Dave PahlYes. Again, I think that overall, we had continued to see that asynchronous behavior as we started back a year ago. And so that has continued. PE, again, it started -- we started to see weakness in Q2, so we've completed now. It actually grew first to second. So we've got several quarters of decline. It was up slightly sequentially. And again, we're not expecting much change in our end markets as we look forward. So okay. Thank you. And let's go to our last caller, please.OperatorOur last caller comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.Christopher CasoI guess just following up on the last few questions. Perhaps you could differentiate a little bit about where you think your customers are still burning through inventory as compared to end demand. And as you noted, the PE segment started to see weakness earlier. We heard from some others that it's no longer an inventory issue. It's more of a demand issue. Perhaps you could talk to that for some of your other end markets? And where we could see incremental weakness of customers still need to bring down inventory further.Dave PahlSure. Yes, Chris, I think if you look across the end markets broadly, you could say that all of them showed weakness and reflective of customers reducing inventories with the exception of automotive. And even inside of that, of course, if you look at industrial, it's not -- all the sectors aren't identical, meaning you've had strength in aerospace, grid infrastructure, in other sectors like that. So -- and PE is the same way, not all of the sectors were as weak or as strong as others. So -- but broadly, you could say it was across each of those markets. Do you have a follow-on?Christopher CasoI do. And maybe as a follow-on, I'll hit on the segment that has remained strong, auto. And when this downturn began, I believe your commentary was that auto was -- had remained stable then. You thought that eventually it would come to auto just because it always has in the past. So far, it hasn't. I think it surprised a lot of us, the resilience on that. Has your view changed about the resilience of the auto market? Do you still expect that that has to correct at some point? And if not, why do you think it's different?Dave PahlYes. So it wouldn't surprise us if it corrected. I don't think anyone can declare certainty on those types of things in the future. But I think that customers will build inventory. I've got 37 years of experience in the industry now, and that's the way the markets have behaved in the past. So that's generally a good guide in the future, but I think you can't pound the table and make absolutes, but certainly wouldn't be surprised if that were the case. So with that, we'll hand it over to Rafael to wrap this up.Rafael R. LizardiThanks, Dave. Let me wrap up by emphasizing what we have said previously. At our core, we're engineers, and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate value for owners is the long-term growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objectives, we will continue to pursue our 3 ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. When we are successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners all benefit. Thank you, and have a good evening.OperatorAnd this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

They Just Have Nowhere to GoCharles Koch-Tied Group Seeks to Block Trump From GOP NominationA 5% US Mortgage Rate Is Seen as Tipping Point to Unlock SupplyRevenue in the third quarter will be $4.36 billion to $4.74 billion, the company said late Tuesday. The midpoint of that range would come in below the average analyst estimate of $4.59 billion.That sent the shares sliding as much as 6.1% to $174.76 on Wednesday, the worst intraday decline since Oct. 26.The outlook bodes poorly for the broader industry because of Texas Instruments’ status as a bellwether. The company has the biggest customer list and product catalog among its peers, making Texas Instruments’ earnings and projections an indicator of demand across many parts of the economy. The largest portion of its revenue comes from makers of industrial machinery and vehicles.The car industry was a bright spot in the latest quarter, Chief Executive Officer Haviv Ilan said, but the rest of the business was sluggish. “Similar to last quarter, we experienced weakness across our end markets with the exception of automotive,” he said in the statement.The company’s customers outside of the automotive market continue to cut orders of new chips, relying on existing stockpiles instead, executives said on a conference call with analysts. The chipmaker’s own inventory is on the rise, meanwhile, according to Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi. It’s climbed to about 207 days’ worth of stock and will likely grow again this quarter in terms of dollar value.Unlike many of its peers, Texas Instruments’ chips have a long shelf life — up to a decade — and the stockpile will help the company ride out future surges in demand, Lizardi said.Story continues“Our inventory lasts a long time,” he said in an interview. “On our shelves, we seal the bags and they can stay there for 10 years and come out still fresh.”For now, order cancellations remain at elevated levels, a sign that customers are staying cautious, the company said.Texas Instruments is the biggest maker of analog semiconductors — chips that perform simple but vital functions, like registering button presses and detecting changes in temperature. They also control motors in everything from space hardware to domestic appliances. Such chips generally require less advanced production techniques than digital products.Profit will be $1.68 to $1.92 a share in the third quarter, Texas Instruments said, compared with a prediction of $1.90.The shares had increased 13% this year through Tuesday’s close, but that’s well below the gains of many big chipmakers, which have benefited from rising optimism that computer sales are bouncing back.Like some of its counterparts, Texas Instruments is building new plants — a longer-term bet that semiconductors will become ever more vital to the economy. That’s been cited as a drag on results in the short term. Executives have said that increased spending on new facilities around the company’s Dallas home base will weigh on profitability until they’re in operation.Revenue in the second quarter fell 13% to $4.53 billion, compared with an average estimate of $4.35 billion. Earnings amounted to $1.87 a share in the period, down from $2.45 a year earlier.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekInfluencers Built Up This Wellness Startup—Until They Started Getting SickAI in Hollywood Has Gone From Contract Sticking Point to Existential CrisisThe Stainless-Steel Boom Is Tearing a South African Mining Region ApartHow a Farmhouse Renovation Inspired a Hotel-Decor VentureWhat China’s Real Estate Market Will Look Like in Five Years©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures.We've also posted supplemental tables on our website that include realized pricing details by product, along with calculations of EBITDAX, cash margins and other non-GAAP measures.With that, let me turn the call over to Dennis.Story continuesDennis L. DegnerThanks, Laith, and thanks to all of you for joining the call today. As we pass the midpoint of the year and shift our focus on the remainder of 2023, Range's business plan is on track. While we continue to make steady progress on key objectives.I believe this quarter's results reflect the resilience and durability of Range's business. Range's competitive cost structure, low capital intensity, liquids optionality and thoughtful hedging allowed us to generate healthy full cycle margins despite cyclically low commodity prices.During the second quarter, Range successfully delivered on our operational plans safely and with peer-leading efficiencies, generated free cash flow despite low commodity prices and retired a portion of our debt maturing in 2025. We also published our latest corporate sustainability report last week, showcasing our low emissions intensity and ongoing safety and environmental leadership, all made possible by our dictated team.As we walk through the results of the quarter, each highlight underpins the durable and repeatable nature of our program that starts with the quality and quantity of Range's inventory, along with our talented team. Looking forward, our objectives remain consistent with us keenly focused on areas discussed on prior calls, peer-leading capital efficiency that supports our low breakeven costs. A program that generates free cash flow through the cycles, continued return of capital to shareholders and prudent capital allocation that balances further debt reduction, opportunistic share repurchases and the long-term development of our world-class asset base. Whether discussing the results during upcoming calls or today, our results and initiatives align and support these strategies.As we look back on the second quarter, all-in capital came in at $175 million, while capital spend for the first half of the year totaled $326 million, placing us firmly on track versus our stated plans. During the early part of Q3, activity was reduced to a single horizontal rig, where we will maintain for the remainder of the year. Our base frac crew will also remain with us through the end of the year with a second spot crew slated for release late in the third quarter.As previously discussed, this will result in a decrease in capital spend across the second half of the year, while production ratably increases, which aligns favorably with today's shape of forward commodity prices. Production for the second quarter came in at 2.08 Bcf equivalent per day, which is slightly ahead of guidance provided during our prior call. The scheduled infrastructure maintenance and upgrade projects were completed on or ahead of schedule, providing uplift for the quarter versus our prior guide.Supporting our production profile, we turned to sales 11 wells located across our dry, wet and super-rich acreage, with the bulk of these wells on pads with existing production, creating some of our most capital-efficient operations. Turn-in-lines for the year are expected to peak in Q3, with turn-in-lines weighted towards the back half of the quarter in conjunction with the commissioning of additional wet gas compression.This should drive sequential growth of approximately 30 million to 50 million cubic feet a day in the third quarter and aligns with our production plan for the year while generating an end-of-year production level of approximately 2.2 Bcf equivalent per day. And to reiterate an earlier message, we see this production profile as a complementary setup as commodity prices improve after the shoulder months and into the winter.Looking at operations. The drilling team continued to improve efficiencies and set new program records during the second quarter. 24 wells were drilled in our Southwest Pennsylvania dry and wet acreage positions while returning to pads with existing production for the majority of our activity. The average drilled lateral length during Q2 was approximately 12,400 feet or a 5% increase versus the 2022 average. As part of Q2, the team also added 4 wells with lateral lengths exceeding 20,600 feet. These represent the longest laterals drilled in the program's history, with the longest measuring just under 22,000 feet.In addition to drilling our longest laterals, the team also showed great efficiencies with 24-hour periods in excess of 6,000 feet. As a result, our average daily lateral footage drilled exceeded 4,700 feet per day in Q2, representing a 42% increase versus the 2022 full year average. This was driven by rig equipment changes that could benefit future development programs.Completions also improved efficiencies and set new program records as the team averaged over 10 stages per day throughout the quarter, including a 24-hour record of 17 stages. As a result, the first half of the year averaged 9.3 frac stages per day. Representing a 13% increase versus the 2022 full year average.Supporting this accomplishment was the utilization of our improved completion surface equipment configuration, enhanced logistics and the benefit of returning to existing pads. On our previous call, we mentioned a pad that was being completed during the first quarter and was projected to be one of Range's most overall efficient pads. This particular operation consisted of 4 wells located in our wet acreage and was completed and turned to sales during the second quarter. On this pad, operations were able to capture 2 of our top fastest days drilling in the lateral and the highest overall completion efficiency for a wet area completion. With the water and logistics team setting new records for water handling by eliminating unnecessary wait time.Overall, the pad cycle time from spud to first sales was just over 180 days, for 65,000 lateral feet of combined wellbore. More than a 50% improvement versus a similar area pad developed in 2021. This ongoing improvement is a byproduct of the use of new technology and the hard work from our operational groups in Pennsylvania. I congratulate the team on this accomplishment and know that they will continue to look for ways to further support our peer-leading capital efficiency.Turning to supply chain. In the last few months, rig count started reflecting signs of decline in the basin as activity decreased under the current commodity environment. Range has also observed some softening in other OFS categories. As we work through Q3 and deploy our annual bid process, we will continue to follow the market and pursue savings opportunities.As we look towards 2024 and beyond, we expect range to remain at the low end of the capital cost curve. On NGL macro, we believe the historically low prices we saw in the second quarter are set to improve later this year. LPG exports out of the U.S. have been robust as the 3-month rolling average reached a new record, exceeding 2 million barrels a day in April. Connecting U.S. LPG supply with recovering petrochemical demand and increasing PDH capacity in China. This growth in exports, coupled with moderating supply growth out of the U.S. is expected to bring storage levels back into balance later this year.Looking at ethane, prices are off their lows. And fundamentals remain supportive as the U.S. has set records for both domestic and export demand with year-to-date 2023 averaging 2.5 million barrels a day or 62,000 barrels a day higher than this time last year. For Range, our uniquely positioned NGL portfolio positions us well to capture opportunities both international and domestic, and supports our 2023 NGL guidance range of $1 per barrel discount to $1 per barrel premium relative to the Mont Belvieu index. This liquids optionality is a positive contributor to Range's resilience through cycles as was the case this quarter. On the natural gas front, we are encouraged by continued gas power generation strength this summer. When paired with minimal dry gas production growth expected from the Haynesville and Permian over the next several quarters. We see the domestic natural gas market gradually rebalancing later this year before further strengthening with increased LNG exports next year and beyond.As we have discussed on prior calls, Range's successes are rooted in a culture, focused on safety and the environment. During the quarter, Range completed the MIQ certification process and received an A grade with third-party audit covering our Southwest PA assets. Range's LDAR inspection program, which increased in frequency to 8x per year at the end of 2022. And source level production facility design, detection and mitigation practices were recognized by the audit and helped us maintain whether the industry's lowest emission intensities.For safety, we observed further improvements in our safety performance in the field in Q2 with 0 OSHA incidents for the quarter. You can find more details on these accomplishments and others in our corporate sustainability report that was released last week.As we clear the midyear point and focus on the second half of 2023 and beyond, our program is on track. After drilling over 1,500 Marcellus wells, the team continues to advance our overall efficiencies. Delivering on repeatable well performance across our large contiguous inventory and marketing our production to diverse outlets providing enhanced margins. As I mentioned on the prior call, the resilience of Range's business is being demonstrated in today's challenging price environment, as we're still delivering on stated objectives and generating free cash flow for 2023.I'll now turn it over to Mark to discuss the financials.Mark S. ScucchiThanks, Dennis. The second quarter was successful operationally and financially, with solid execution across the business. Cash flow totaled $187 million, funding capital expenditures and the quarterly dividend, while maintaining balance sheet strength and the trajectory to our target capital structure despite what we expect are near cyclical lows in commodity prices.2023 commodity prices have obviously been softer than last year and are below the level that can sustain industry production levels. Fortunately, Range is equipped with one of the lowest full cycle breakeven costs in the business. The benefit of going through a period of low prices is the visibility into the economic durability of assets across the E&amp;P space.Given the economic resilience of Range's portfolio, our goals and expected plan for 2023 are consistent with last year despite different prices. We'll develop high-quality assets, generate free cash flow, return capital to investors, strengthen our business and enhance our position to participate in continued demand growth through our low-cost, long-life inventory. This is in stark contrast to higher-cost, shorter-life assets, where operators are seeking ways to reduce outspend, in many cases, by allowing production to decline.Taking a closer look at Range's second quarter results. Cash flow of $187 million was driven by strong production levels, achieving pre-hedge realizations of $2.47 per Mcfe. This realized unit price is $0.37 above NYMEX Henry Hub, receiving the benefit of Range's diverse sales outlets for natural gas and the pricing uplift from natural gas liquids and condensate.During the second quarter, Range's realized NGL price was $21.51 per barrel or $3.58 on an Mcfe basis. Range's portfolio of transportation capacity and customer contracts supported differentials, such that the total per unit price received by Range remains a strong premium to Henry Hub Natural Gas.In addition, Range's approach to hedging provided an improvement to per unit realizations of $0.41 for a hedged realized price of $2.88 per Mcfe. Hedged cash margin per unit of production was a resilient $0.97, benefiting from a persistent focus on efficiency and the price-linked nature of certain costs. Total cash unit costs improved by $0.32 versus second quarter last year.The change from prior year primarily relates to savings in processing and power costs, which are related to NGL and natural gas prices, with variations in other line items relating to labor cost inflation or the timing of planned workover projects. Cash interest expense declined by $9 million for the quarter compared to Q2 last year on reduced debt balances equating to $0.05 per Mcfe in savings. These improvements more than offset slightly higher LOE as we wrapped up planned annual workover projects early in Q2.Looking quickly at gathering, processing and transportation costs, we have improved our annual guidance for that line item by approximately $0.05 at the midpoint. As mentioned on previous calls, processing costs tend to move about $0.01 per Mcfe for every $1 per barrel move in our realized NGL price. For context, since the start of the year, NGL strip prices for 2023 are lower by about $4 per barrel, and that is being reflected in our improved GP&amp;T guidance, showing the right way risk and the natural hedge that our processing contract provides. Range's financial hedging program supported realized prices for the second quarter with approximately $90 million in NYMEX related gains.Looking forward, Range's natural gas is approximately 50% hedged for the balance of 2023 with an average $3.42 floor, providing further support to Range's free cash flow profile. For 2024, we've hedged approximately 50% of natural gas at an average floor price of $3.70 using a combination of $4 swaps and collars retaining upside to roughly $5.50. During the quarter, we initiated a modest 2025 hedge position on natural gas at an average price of $4.12.The objective of this program is essentially to cover fixed costs at attractive levels, enabling consistent free cash flow generation, while maintaining exposure to a market poised we expect to positively respond to new LNG facilities coming online alongside rising power demand with the current backdrop of reduced industry drilling activity.Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q2, we held cash balances of $162 million with the change from last quarter, primarily deployed to repurchase bonds due in 2025 at a modest discount to par, totaling $62 million in principal. We will continue to manage our cash balance to retain flexibility for efficient working capital management, bond redemption and share repurchases. This cash balance, combined with future free cash flow, and $1.2 billion available on our undrawn revolving credit facility, provide ample liquidity to efficiently operate our business and take advantage of opportunities the market may present.We've been focused on a target capital structure for several years. And as of quarter end, we have reduced debt net of cash by roughly $2.5 billion since it peaked in 2018. This places us very close to entering our target range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion net debt. With current leverage of 0.9x debt to EBITDAX and close proximity to our balance sheet targets, we believe the company is in great shape to continue value creation on a stable financial base throughout business cycles.Successful second quarter results, combined with a positive industry backdrop for Range going forward, support our confidence in the return of capital program discussed on previous calls. We believe a stable, reliable fixed cash dividend is appropriate at this time and in this market while remaining opportunistic in our share repurchases with capacity available totaling $1.1 billion, alongside our primary objective of reaching target debt levels. We will remain flexible and adapt to market conditions, project returns and prudent reinvestment.Range's story for a long time has been about innovation, translated into reality through dedicated teamwork, -- hard work, focus and swift but precise adjustments to our business plan without varying from our core objectives for demonstrating the value of Range's portfolio and business. This focus and dedication will continue as Range's business is strong and is primed for impending demand growth domestically and internationally for natural gas and natural gas liquids. With a strong financial foundation and largest portfolio of quality inventory in Appalachia, paired with transportation to delivery points across key U.S. and international markets. We seek to continue this trend of disciplined value creation for our shareholders.Dennis, back to you.Dennis L. DegnerThanks, Mark. Before moving to Q&amp;A, I'll reiterate a message we've shared previously. As the world continues to move towards cleaner, more efficient fuels, natural gas and NGLs will be the affordable, reliable and abundant supply that helps power our everyday lives by also helping billions of others improve their standard of living. We believe Appalachia natural gas and natural gas liquids are positioned to meet that future demand. And within Appalachia, Range will be among those leading the way on capital efficiency, emissions intensity and transparency.Range has derisked a large inventory of high-quality wells across our 0.5 million net acreage position in Appalachia, and translated that into a business capable of generating free cash flow through commodity cycles. We are in the best position in the company's history. And I look forward to our next many calls together as we continue to demonstrate our dedication to safe, efficient operations and consistently generating sustainable and competitive returns for shareholders.With that, we'll open the line for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperatorThank you, Mr. Degner. The question-and-answer session will now begin. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Bertrand Donnes with Truist.Bertrand William DonnesJust wanted to talk about the turn-in-line disclosure versus the percentage of CapEx so far this year. I'm assuming there's something in there about how much capital you may be put towards wells that are ready to be turned to mine or completions, but that aren't captured in your turn-in-line schedule. So just maybe you could address the lower percentage of turn-in-line so far versus the higher CapEx?Dennis L. DegnerYes, thanks for the question. As you look at the first half of the year, we started off with a couple of drilling rigs and then bolted on a third horizontal rig as we started to get toward the back half of Q1. So when you look at Q2 from a drilling activity perspective, it really became our highest drilling activity.And then on the completion side, we kept a base frac crew operating through the balance of the first half of the year, and it will remain with us through all of this year's program, but we picked up the spot frac crew in the last weeks of Q2 as well. And when you think about the completion versus drilling percentages of spend, it starts to clearly change the capital -- that activity cadence starts to change the capital profile at that point.A lot of our turn-in-lines from that drilling activity that are getting kicked out are going to then see first sales and production start to come together in Q3, especially more weighted to the back half of the quarter. Where -- I think, approximately 1/3 of our turn-in-lines are in Q3, and then you're going to see the majority of those actually be in the last weeks of the quarter. So that's from an activity cadence standpoint, how it will shake out for the balance of the year. And then once you see Q4, it will be actually a tail off, not too dissimilar to what you saw in Q1 and Q2.Bertrand William DonnesGreat. And then the follow-up is kind of on that point. If you do have a very light maybe end of the year, maybe the last 1.5 months or so, program, we're looking at a pretty attractive strip maybe 1Q, 2Q of next year? Is there some discussion going on internally on whether or not you might want to pull some of that capital from '24 to '23 if the commodity environment pass for it?Dennis L. DegnerYes, good question. I think those are questions we always have internally to make sure that we're optimizing not only this year's program, but we're thinking about what's best as we start to look forward as well. We've got a history of demonstrating of being at or below our communicated capital guidance. But one of the reasons why we added some of our capital flexibility this year for some of the inventory that was at $30 million that we communicated as part of our annual plan was to allow for that kind of optionality.Maintenance is really below the 615 level, which is the upper end of our guide. But having that flexibility to be at the upper end of that capital guide allows us to consider what's the proper setup for 2024. What does it look like to maintain activity or a particular rig that maybe you're going to retain for that last month or 1.5 months. So it's all part of optimizing that end of your portion of your program and setting up for 2024. So we'll absolutely have those conversations internally. They'll be necessary in both not only this year but in future years to come.OperatorAnd one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Umang Choudhary with Goldman Sachs &amp; Company.Umang ChoudharyMy first question was on cost inflation. Any color you can provide on leading-edge material, labor and service costs and the implication of lower cost heading into 2024?Dennis L. DegnerYes. I'm going to somewhat build upon, I think, the response that we've shared at the prior earnings call and I'll start off by saying it's still a little bit early to frame what that will look like for 2024. Encouraging thing is we're clearly seeing some rigs come out of the mix. If you look at where we were at the end of December in 2022 versus where we were in total rig count last week, I think we've got around 110 rigs approximately that have come out of the mix.The Haynesville is now down in the 45%, 46% range. Of course, you're seeing Appalachia at a similar level also with other rigs coming out of other basins that saw activity over the last 24 months during different pricing environments. All of that started to manifest itself into some conversations around rig availability, what that will look like for 2024. We've seen some early signs of relief on areas like tubular goods, where you've seen not only rig activity influence that, but also just the supply catching up with what was the demand in the past and also inputs as a part of that supply chain start to normalize.And then, of course, we're starting to see some availability, and I'll just say some relief when it comes to some of this supporting equipment as a part of our day in and day out operations.As we get ready to go into the bid process this fall, we fully expect to have a lot better way of framing what this could look like for 2024. But I'd say, all in all, we're encouraged by some of the relief that we're seeing -- but we also know I'll say this, there will be certain equipment like maybe the e-fleets on the frac side, maybe some of your hiring specification equipment for the long laterals like we talked about in our prepared remarks today. So we would expect that equipment to remain in pretty high demand. And though there could be and we'd expect to see some relief on pricing from a service perspective come along with that, that's part of what still needs to materialize. And of course, we're also seeing week in and week out some additional adjustment of the total U.S. rig count.The last thing I would say is where everything shake out from a service perspective, we really expect to be on the leading edge of what that capital efficiency looks like, coupled with our service cost. I think we've talked about it in prior one-on-one meetings and on these calls. But when you look at Slide 7 and where it ranges, cost per Mcfe for that molecule replacement on a decline basis each year, you take our low base decline, you factor in our efficiencies that some of which we set new records on and talked about today, it puts us in a position of even in today's pricing to be at $0.76 per Mcfe replacement versus our peer average of $1.So however it shakes out, we really see that still being on the leading edge based upon our team's results and also with our contiguous position that we had that we're developing.Umang ChoudharyGot you. That's very comprehensive. My next question was on hedging. You are now 50% hedged for next year at 370 floor. This is very in line with the past commentary of covering fixed costs and capital commitments given your bullish outlook for 2025, how are you thinking about hedging for 2025? Do you plan to hedge more to cover the fixed cost and the capital commitments -- are you happy with the low 20% exposure that you have right now?Mark S. ScucchiI'll start this one off. I think you've touched on the theme, the philosophy behind our hedging program, and that is largely and essentially to cover the fixed costs, and maintain exposure to a strong market. Obviously, with LNG facilities being commissioned over the next year and 2, we expect a significant rerating in the commodity price.One of the best places to be as a corporation is in a position where you don't have to do something. Having paid off $2.5 billion of debt ranges in a position where hedging is not necessarily something we have to do, certainly not to levels that are extremely high, like the 70, 80-plus percent levels you might have seen 5 and 10 years ago across the industry and it range specifically. So where we sit today, we've got just a tiny bit to do on the balance sheet before we enter our target net debt level. So as you look at the '23 hedge position and approximately 50% of gas, and you look at 2024, we've got just a little bit, as I said, of progress work yet left to do.You also have the construction of the in-service timing into 2024 of the new facilities and that rerating of demand, making its way into the forward curve. So as you look into 2025, it's a modest foundation. We think that, that current position is sufficient to cover fixed costs. So as I started, we're in a position where we don't have to do anything. We like the hedge book where it is. We think that meets our risk management objectives and to turn it around. That means while we are actually encouraged by the way 2024 is set up, we're 50% hedged, but we're 50% unhedged.And for 2025, we have a good foundation, but we're 80% unhedged, and we'll be responsive to market developments between now and then, we'll monitor the cadence of construction in service and demand and what the forward market may offer us. But having said all that, again, we like the book where it stands. It covers our basic philosophical objectives.OperatorOne moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with ROTH MKM.Leo Paul MarianiI was hoping maybe you could just talk a little bit about sort of capital allocation here. Obviously, you decided to buy back some bonds in the open market at a discount, which always seems to be a good use of proceeds. But as a result, we didn't really see anything on the share buyback side. And maybe you could just kind of give us a little color in terms of how you're kind of thinking about using that free cash flow for the balance of the year and how you kind of decide between debt paydown and buybacks?Mark S. ScucchiSure. I think where I would start with our waterfall of capital allocation really is all based on the assets. When you're talking about an asset base, it's got 30 years of drilling activity, production 50-plus year type productive horizon, you're trying to make sure that you have a financial foundation of a company that will comfortably navigate through cycles and capitalize on the opportunities that are presented to it.As I said, the best place to be in a corporate perspective is to not have to do something. So where we are today is we've made great progress on the balance sheet, but that does remain a priority. As we've talked about before, funding our key objectives: One, maintenance capital; Two, debt reduction; Three, shareholder returns, be it the dividend or the share buyback and for the growth when appropriate.So where we sit today, obviously, commodity prices are lower and by definition, cash flow is a little bit lower. As we sit and look at the performance of the various securities and where the prices are and being able to pull in bonds, the use of our free cash flow this year to reduce debt and enhance equity owners value through that path seems the most prudent.Now having said all of that, one of the keys to our capital allocation plan and our return of capital program is the opportunistic element. The reason it's not purely formulaic is that the market moves, interest rates, obviously, are moving around, commodity prices are moving around. That we want to be able to allocate capital in a nimble and prudent fashion. So debt is certainly the priority but that waterfall and capital allocation, as I said before, is not mutually exclusive.If we were to see a big pullback in the market, for example, recession fears, obviously, are being chattered about what happens to the economy more broadly. If there's a broad-based pullback in the equity markets, Range has $1.1 billion available on our current program, and we believe that the balance sheet strength would certainly give us the opportunity to step in and buyback shares if we were to see any sort of retracement. So for the time being, we're comfortable with that methodology. That approach to debt is the priority, but we clearly will make use of the share repurchase program just as we have for the last 2 years.Leo Paul MarianiOkay. And then just as a quick follow-up. Obviously, Range has sort of been in maintenance mode on production for quite a few years now. Obviously, you guys talked about the upside expected in both gas and NGL markets as we get into '24 and even more so in '25 on gas. What's kind of the latest thinking in terms of that sort of maintenance mode on production? Is that something you think is likely to continue in a '24 and then maybe it's '25 where perhaps there can be a slightly different decision on that with just higher LNG exports and potentially MVP coming on in '24. Just any color around that would be appreciated.Dennis L. DegnerYou bet, Leo. This -- as we think about 2024, I think a good starting point is to always think about maintenance for our program. That's about 60 to 65 wells kind of year in and year out to hold our assets flat in our current infrastructure utilized.But as we start to look forward, I mean, there are several reasons to have a positive outlook. And some of them we've touched on either through Q&amp;A or through prepared remarks today and in prior calls, LNG clearly being one of them, we're still optimistic that MVP reaches a place where it's commissioned. And all of that starts to have a positive outlook.But the other part is inventory exhaustion. And I think as you start to look more and more around not only Appalachia but other basins, you're starting to see that conversation get elevated along with degrading well performance year-over-year. We think that all is positive when you think it will not -- how it aligns back with Range's long runway of inventory and our ability to potentially grow in the future.But growth is going to really come back to a point of what both the basin fundamentals point to and also the macro. So we'll be patient. We'll look at what the best program is for '24 and beyond. But the way to think about it today is to consider our program to start from a base of maintenance.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Roger Read with WFS.Roger David ReadRoger Read, Wells Fargo. Sorry, I just typed in WFS on the registration page. Thanks for having us on, couple of the questions. I don't want to repeat. So I'm going to come at this a little differently.On your capital efficiencies, you talked about cutting spud to first production to 180 days, obviously, pretty impressive as we think about your outlook for latter part of '24 and '25, which I don't think we have any disagreement with. As you increase activity, what things can you do now? What best practices or learnings have you put in place that are going to allow you to maintain capital efficiency as rig counts go back up as spending goes back up in the space and presumably, you'll want to add production as well.Dennis L. DegnerYes. Roger, I think there's maybe a couple of ways of bifurcating this conversation. And I think one is how we kind of view our efficiencies and our service costs versus overall capital efficiency. And if anything, demonstrates the team's ability to continue to deliver on leading efficiencies, I think our Q2 results have clearly demonstrated that.For the group to be able to basically have a 13% increase in completion, [frac seizures] per day in the first half of the year versus the full year average of last year, some of the drilling footage accomplishments, all in and around prior producing activity, returning to pad sites with production. It just as an old supervisor once told me ""success begets success, and the teams continue to build upon that momentum"". So we would expect to see further progress -- progression in our efficiencies in '24 and '25 as again, we continue to move back to those pad sites. So that's one arrow in the quiver.I think the second one is, as we continue to root out nonproductive time. When you move back to these pad sites, you have the ability to look for ways to more efficiently manage our logistics, whether it's the water recycling program that we have and not only the cost savings measures that, that brings to the table, but also just overall the efficiency enhancements. It really becomes a force multiplier. So we see areas of improvement there as well. But I'll say this. Lastly, our long lateral development always plays a role in this, with us now having drilled our longest laterals this past quarter, exceeding 20,000 feet. We're excited to see those wells come online here in the quarters ahead and monitor those results. We think those play a significant part. But capital efficiency will no now fluctuate as we start to have conversations about is it some low level of growth in the future? What kind of inventory gets added as a part of that? But from a cost per foot basis, we would expect to still be on the leading edge of how that -- how those numbers are manifested and how we basically execute the programs going forward.Roger David ReadOkay. Appreciate that. The other question I had, best way for you to answer or best opportunity for you to answer it. We have seen quite a resurgence in -- I mean, I guess you could say some commodity prices in general, but particularly ethane here over the last call it, 4 to 6 weeks. I was just -- you gave a fairly positive outlook for what's going on the NGL front. So I was just curious if there's anything you've seen in that to explain some of the strength in the pricing recovery.Alan EngbergYes. Thanks, Roger. This is Alan Engberg, I manage Liquids Marketing business. I'll give it a shot, give you some background on what's been behind some of the recent strength that we've seen in ethane.I think I would start by saying ethane fundamentals have been pretty tight for a while now. We've mentioned it in prior calls, but the days supply hit 5-year lows last year, and we've been hugging those 5-year lows all through this year as well. So when the market is tight like that, there's really not a lot of cushion to manage changes or tightening, let's say, in the supply-demand fundamentals.And really, that's what we've seen in June and so far in July. So the drivers of that list about 5 different ones. But first one, I'll list actually is the cost driver. So we've got -- someone asked earlier about inflation, we had PPIs of reflecting about a 13% increase in pipeline costs come into effect this year. So that effectively raises the floor for ethane recovery for the industry and that led to probably more ethane rejection. So we had less supply, we believe, during the month of June.At the same time, we had a tremendous amount of heat as we're all aware of. That again led to, let's say, in some of the further out basins, more of an incentive to reject ethane and to sell the gas locally. Added to that, the heat also affects fractionation efficiencies. As you can imagine, ethane is the lightest molecule needs the most cooling. So it's the one that gets affected the most when it comes to fractionation efficiencies in the heat. And there, you lose, call it, 5% to 8% of efficiency.The other thing that has become I guess, more to the -- it's come more to the forefront is that fractionation capacity overall in the U.S. Gulf is actually kind of tight. We saw it back in 2018 and ethane ran up to in the 60s for a short while back then. I think it was third quarter of 2018. But ethane -- or sorry, fractionation capacities in the Gulf are just plain tight. And as a result of that, what we believe is happening -- and it's hard to really quantify because it doesn't get reported, but we believe that the ethane inventory that you see reported by the EIA, the fraction of that, that is unprocessed, that's what we call Y-grade has actually increased relative to the fraction of that, that is processed or what we call a purity ethane molecule. So again, the ethane inventory is a mix of process (inaudible) and even stuff that we call EP mix, but we believe that due to fractionation capacity tightness, there's just been less purity ethane available.As a result of that, when we got into late June, early July, the end of ethylene maintenance season. Demand increased for the reasons I already talked about, supply decreased and the ethane price spiked. Now going forward, what we see is continued tightness, the market actually looks good. But I'm not sure we'll see prices continue like in the 40s. And the reason for that is we do have some relief coming in fractionation capacity in the second half of the year to the major midstream companies in the U.S. Gulf Coast are each adding a fractionator about 150,000 barrels per day each.Nevertheless, we do see ethane inventories on a day supply basis, continuing near the lows because operating rates have increased, new demand has come on and the market will continue to be snugged this year and next year.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Scialla with Stephens.Michael Stephen SciallaDennis, gave a lot of detail on OFS costs. I guess based on what you're seeing right now, is it fair to frame it that you would expect to see some savings on rig day rates and ancillary costs, but not really on frac crews? And can you talk about the cost of that spot frac crew that you added versus your contracted rates and maybe how the efficiency compared as well?Dennis L. DegnerYou bet, Michael. The spot crew that we brought on recently I would say, is more in line with kind of current pricing structures. So it had some advantages that came with it, very efficient. We're really happy with the results that we've seen. First pad has been completed, and it was actually in line with what we were seeing with our base frac crew that we'll have for the bulk of the year.So in a lot of ways, I think it's shown the repeatable nature of not only the procedures that the teams put in place, but also the efficiencies that -- in a lot of cases, several service providers have also elevated their respective performance through just routine operations, maintenance, et cetera. But pricing for the spot crew was very much in line with what we would expect for I'll just say, current equipment that's been available that we were able to get spot pricing for. That crew will then frac another pad site for us here in the back half of the quarter and then get released and then we'll be back to our base frac crew for the remainder of the year.Michael Stephen SciallaOkay. So if I heard you right there, you are seeing some improvement in prices even on the completion side as well?Dennis L. DegnerThere are some small signs of relief. But again, I'll phrase this as small only because that was a spot crew of utilization versus being able to leverage that pricing into a full year of, we'll call it, day in and day out activity for 12 months. So no, it was small. I would say it was difficult to quantify in a bigger picture.Michael Stephen SciallaUnderstood. And you mentioned your new sustainability report. I guess I want to see what needs to happen for you to get to net zero scope on 2 by 2025. And can you say how much will be through offsets versus actual abatement and maybe any targets beyond the '25 goal that you're thinking about?Dennis L. DegnerYes. As we start to think about the next couple of years, we've got a keen focus on how we can continue to directly reduce our emissions from our operations efficiently, economically, and I'll just say responsibly, like we've really executed the rest of our programs, whether it's drilling and completing a well, producing a pad site or reducing our emissions. It's the same culture, same approach regardless of what the topic may be. So we've got still a keen focus on further reductions in that regard.We're looking at ways that we can look at reducing emissions associated with combustion of fuel on our particular operations. As you can imagine, it's small incremental bolt-ons, but it could be as little as switching over to electrified power plants on location for lights and ancillary power versus traditional diesel or gasoline fuel type equipment, coupled with our E fleet, of course, on the fracking side.Carbon offsets will play a role, and it is something that we communicated for the first time it is sustainability report to start outlining Range's approach. What we don't want to do is really, I will just say, we want to bridge the gap effectively with those carbon offsets with good quality offsets but remain at the same time, keenly focused on how we can directly, economically and efficiently reduce our emissions off pad.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Paul Diamond with Citi.Paul Michael DiamondJust a quick one, talking about -- you had mentioned a specific pad and wet acreage that really helped you out with your highest overall efficiency. How should we think about the extrapolation of those techniques and that level of efficiency more to some of the dryer acreage? Should we think about that as one for one on trend? Or is there some variation there?Dennis L. DegnerYes, thanks for asking that question. I think it's -- at this point, I would say it's not something that we see immediately that we can translate across the entire basin, but we will progress in that direction, meaning staging areas get redefined, trucking routes for hauling water, all of this is, I'll just say, a progression that can occur quarter-over-quarter that translates into those improved efficiencies.Over the course of time, do we see this being the new standard that turns into a repeatable metric, we do. And that's part of us communicating it today. But do we see this being the new standard for 2024. We may not be quite there yet because we also recognize there's diversity and I'll just say ingress and egress across the field and how we're drilling it from a perspective of lateral lengths. There is some variability.As you can tell, our average program for the past several years has been kind of 10,000 to 12,000 feet in average lateral length. But we will have those moments where we'll have 20,000 to 18,000-foot type laterals depending upon where we're developing assets. So we see this as translatable to the dry gas and super-rich areas. It will take some time as we take these, I'll just say, more recent learnings and translate that into future development program execution.Paul Michael DiamondUnderstood. Just one quick kind of more macro follow-up. You guys talked a bit about seeing just nationwide activity reducing -- with the current strength of the kind of '24 beyond curve, I guess, at what point do you see that activity kind of reverting? Is it a pricing needs to be materially higher? Or is it -- are you guys expecting more of just kind of a run rate flattening through '24?Dennis L. DegnerI think as you think about '24 today, I mean I think we're going to have to see a little bit more from, let's just say, development of the LNG infrastructure. Again, I'll kind of start off with base maintenance for us is the starting point. But as you start to think about '24, the LNG infrastructure that's coming online, all signs point to it being on time, I think, which is clearly encouraging. But to get to the other side of inventory levels that we're going to have at the end of injection season, seeing what kind of winter that we have, we see this being as more of a constructive outlook as you start to get into the bulk of 2024. So that's when I think you start to see us have the flexibility of the program to then assess what level of activity best aligns with both those basin fundamentals and the macro and then setting us up for 2025.OperatorAnd one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Roberts with TPH &amp; Co.Jacob Phillip RobertsJust curious on the GP&amp;T guide, looking at where Q2 came in and kind of the expected prices, I believe, on Slide 34 in Q3 and Q4, it looks like that guide has the ability to head even lower. So just I'm curious on the assumptions being baked in there.Mark S. ScucchiYes. This is Mark. I'll lead off on that. I mean you've got 6 months down and the experience of NGL prices to date and gas prices today, other things that are going into -- in there, are your electricity costs that are behind compression and other things. So as we look at the forward curves for each of the products, the respective processing and transportation costs of those estimated power costs in the latter half of this year and heading into winter, you likely and hopefully see some higher prices as we would expect once we're outside the injection season, and there's a little more understanding of what this winter may look like.So the answer to your question is prices can go either direction. Therefore, the GP&amp;T number can go either direction. So it's just a great feature of that contract by design to be right way risk and give us good exposure to improving prices or insulation when we see lower prices.Jacob Phillip RobertsGreat. And then my follow-up would be just in terms of the DUCs you guys have in the system right now, are those going to be more of a feature in Q3 or in Q4? And then perhaps -- any more details on the cadence activity within the fourth quarter would be helpful.Dennis L. DegnerThanks, Jacob. From a Q3 and Q4 perspective, I know we tried to briefly touch on this a moment ago, but to expand on it, we'll have the one spot crew that's going to complete another pad site for us plus our base crew. And then, of course, the turn-in-lines are going to quickly follow. So in the back half of Q3, we'll see our bulk of our Q3 turn-in-line start to reach first sales. And then you'll see also in the early part of Q4, you'll see some of that turn-in-lines from the Q2 and Q3 activity start to manifest themselves into production in that back half of the year.Production into Q3, we touched on it briefly, but should be around $30 million to $50 million a day, up from where we were on average for Q2, but we should be on average in Q4 2.2 Bcf equivalent per day. So the ramp will be a little more significant, and we like the shape of that curve as you start to see that activity cadence turn into turn-in-lines and sales volumes that more align with where the curve as we see it today is on commodity prices. So we think it will align with a much better output as we start to think about back half of the year cash flows and set up for 2024.OperatorWe are nearing the end of the conference, and we will go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America for our final question.Douglas George Blyth LeggateThank you, everybody. Note to self, don't hit star 1 more than once. So thanks for getting me (inaudible) moves you to the back of the queue. But anyway, Dennis, this is your first call as CEO. And I wanted to ask you about one of the slides in your deck, your share performance and the market's obvious lack of confidence in the forward curve that you've spent a lot of time talking about. And I want to refer specifically to Slide 6.So you're basically saying you've got a 30- to 50-year drilling inventory to hold production flat between $2 and $3 gas. Obviously, your stock is materially undervalued if you believe the strip. So my question is, why not monetize some of that and bring forward some of that value, take advantage of the weakness in your stock price? And I'm just asking the question, as you're new as CEO, what can you do to drive market recognition of this value that you clearly see in your stock?Dennis L. DegnerYes. Thanks for the question, Doug. I think when I started to think about that value proposition that you're raising as we start to look forward, we see inventory exhaustion playing a real role in the conversation as you start to get through '25, '26 and beyond. You're seeing it in research pieces today from analysts who are looking at and even internal work that we've done as well where you start to see degradation in well performance of some of these other basins. We see that as being constructive long term for Range in that runway of inventory that we have as we have the ability to continue to repeat performance.When you look at Slide 6 and how the inventory that we have has been, it's got a really low-cost breakeven. And we're not just targeting the lower end of that sector today, we're drilling in and around all of those respective bids that you see on that graphical profile. So we think that bodes well for us. We also want to maintain control in our development program going forward.Moving back to these pad sites with existing production plays a significant part of our story, our efficiencies, our low-cost environment and our capital efficiency. And so maintaining control in that environment would be very important for us as well. So as we start to think about what this future looks like, we think that there will be a greater appreciation for Range of share value. We'll have that ability to return that value to shareholders, either through expansion of the dividend in the future, additional share repurchases or either further debt reduction based upon the ability to throw off free cash flow through these cycles in the future, while maybe some of the other either peers or other basins have a difficult time doing so.Douglas George Blyth LeggateOkay. So you're not -- you're happy with the portfolio as it stands today is the bottom line?Dennis L. DegnerAbsolutely.Douglas George Blyth LeggateOkay. All right. My follow-up is maybe for Mark. Mark, I apologize, it's a hedging question. I know someone asked this earlier. But just looking at 2025 and your comments about the curve, which I think is becoming consensus. Should we anticipate any additional hedges? Or are you happy with where the hedge book sits now? Is this a new normal in terms of proportion volumes?Mark S. ScucchiDoug. So we are happy with where the position is, and I'm not going to lock us into a specific number and codify that, that 20% to 25%, assuming a maintenance program is the specific right answer because the market moves.So I think between now and then, what we will do is monitor the progress for the construction and expected service dates of LNG liquefaction facilities and other demand, be it in basin demand, of which there are some pretty substantial incremental pieces coming online, be it in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, just Midwest type in-basin demand. Be it power or more industrial. Extra transport where we can move gas out of the basin. Maintenance is clearly our baseline, but growth will be appropriate and we'll be able to accelerate the value of our deep inventory at the right moment.So all of that and the timing of that will play back into what our hedge profile looks like. So the 25 book is a nice foundation. It's enough for the way we see the cards being laid out, the way we expect them to be laid out over the next year or so. But it does present optionality if we see significant prices that changes, changes that we like, and you can derisk a small portion of that, that may support expanded shareholder returns. That may support accelerated deleveraging. Those are great outcomes. But at the end of the day, we don't have to add any more and we like where this book is as of today.Douglas George Blyth LeggateI'm sure we'll have the growth discussion some other time, but thanks so much, guys. I appreciate you taking my questions.OperatorThank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Degner for his closing remarks.Dennis L. DegnerYes. Thank you for everyone for joining us on the call this morning and talking to our Q2 results. We look forward to the next call coming up for Q3. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to follow up with our Investor Relations team. Thank you.OperatorThank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect.]"

It marked a slowdown from a 4% increase in May.After hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, inflation has slowed for 12 straight months.Consumer inflation has fallen to its lowest annual rate in over two years. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (Joe Raedle via Getty Images)David Kelley, JP Morgan Asset Management's chief global strategist, says inflation is likely to move ""sideways"" for the rest of the year and decline in 2024.""Net, net, inflation isn’t dead. But the extraordinary pandemic push on prices from shortages and shift to stay-at-home purchases is clearly over, and the Fed for the first time has the upper hand in its inflation fight,"" pointed out MUFG's chief economist, Chris Rupkey.So is corporate America seeing the same narrative around inflation as Mr. Market is rallying behind?Here's what four top execs who control companies with more than $400 billion in market value just told Yahoo Finance Live about the state of inflation.Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo CFOMarket Cap: $263 billion""The fact that commodities have moderated, they're still inflationary. And I suspect even as we go into next year, commodities will still be inflationary. And with that, prices will still increase.

We'll see how the balance of the year plays its way out.""James Peters, Whirlpool CFOMarket Cap: $8 billion""From a material cost perspective, we saw the peak late last year. If we look at our costs, our logistics costs have come down. Labor is one cost where I would say inflation has steadied. It's at a more typical rate.

We encourage you to access these materials as we'll cover portions of them during the call. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws. Actual results may be different than forward-looking statements and involve risks outlined in our safe harbor statement and disclosed in Nucor's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information and disclosures, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. So with that, let's turn the call over to Leon.Story continuesLeon J. TopalianThanks, Jack, and welcome, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking the 31,000 members of the Nucor team for delivering another outstanding quarter. The investments we've made in recent years to grow our core and expand into new markets are generating strong returns for our shareholders, increased capabilities for our customers, and the Nucor team is executing safely and efficiently. In fact, through the first half of 2023, we're on track to set another annual safety record for the fifth straight year, further proof of the world-class performance by Nucor teammates who live our culture every single day. Looking at our financial performance in the second quarter, Nucor generated approximately $2.2 billion of EBITDA and $1.5 billion of net earnings or $5.81 per diluted share. On a year-to-date basis, we've generated $4 billion in EBITDA and $10.26 earnings per share, representing our second best start to any fiscal year in Nucor's history. Each of the 3 reporting segments saw higher earnings in Q2 compared to Q1, with the largest gains coming from the steel mill segments, which saw higher realized pricing. The steel mills order book remains healthy with strong demand from automotive, energy, heavy equipment, bridge construction, data centers and manufacturing. And within Steel Products, Q2 marks the fifth consecutive quarter with segment earnings of approximately $1 billion or higher, and we continue to see a healthy backlog at attractive margins through the remainder of the year. Looking ahead, we believe steel markets for the remainder of the year will remain healthy, driven by strong manufacturing investment and infrastructure spending. U.S. GDP growth forecast for 2023 have been revised upward on multiple occasions in response to economic data that continues to demonstrate the resiliency of the U.S. economy. Turning to our growth strategy. We've completed slightly more than 50% of our $10 billion CapEx plan to grow our core steelmaking operations. Several of these investments are already generating incremental earnings and growing our share in key markets. Over the next several years, we'll continue to execute on our CapEx plan to better position Nucor with more value-added steelmaking capabilities. In our sheet mill group, we've continued our ramp-up at Nucor Steel Gallatin in the second quarter, the Gallatin team has achieved full run rate production levels in June and saw increasing levels of profitability each month of the quarter. I'd like to congratulate our entire Gallatin team for their continued focus on safely bringing the facility to full run rate production as well as taking care of our customers during this time. At Nucor Steel West Virginia, we expect to begin construction in the coming weeks. We remain excited about this transformative project to serve the Heartland of American steel consumption with a considerably lower carbon footprint. In our plate mill Group, the Brandenburg team in Kentucky continues to ramp up production at the most advanced EAF plate mill in the world. As we've shared before, our focus at Brandenburg in 2023 is on proving our capabilities rather than maximizing output. We spent the first half of the year dialing in the caster and downstream operations, and we're now producing finished products ranging in thickness from 1 to 12 inches. In the second half of '23, we expect to produce approximately 300,000 tons and turn profitable by year's end. Our customers continue to express strong interest in Brandenburg's capabilities, and our team there is working to ensure we can provide a full range of plate solutions. Finally, in the bar mill group, construction on our new rebar micro mill in Lexington, North Carolina, broke ground in May and is slated for completion by early 2025. This highly efficient 430,000 ton bar mill will serve the growing construction markets throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions. Our Steel Products segment continues to generate strong earnings, with nearly $2 billion of pretax earnings year-to-date, representing 45% of Nucor's earnings mix for the first half of 2023. This is a testament to our industry-leading capabilities across a broad array of engineered steel construction products and solutions. Today, Nucor can produce an estimated 90% of the steel intensity of a typical manufacturing facility or a large warehouse with over 100 fabrication centers throughout North America, we are the leading supplier of the steel products most commonly used in nonresidential construction. Last year, we provided solutions to more than 5,000 steel products customers with none representing more than 5% of consolidated revenue. And we're leveraging our channels to market and broad capabilities to cross-sell products such as overhead doors, racking and other solutions. In recent years, our customers are attributing more value to the solutions we provide, helping to depart from the traditional cost-plus paradigm. They recognize the incremental value we provide through engineering, detailing, fabrication, custom finishing and our nationwide logistics capabilities. As a result, products such as joist and deck, pre-engineered metal buildings and insulated metal panels command higher margins than in years past. Our performance also reflects some fundamental changes we've made to improve efficiencies in metal buildings and rebar fabrication, which are now driving better results for our customers and our shareholders. Turning to our Expand Beyond strategy. We're pleased with the initial success of our 4 new growth platforms and we continue to develop a pipeline of potential growth opportunities. During the second quarter, Nucor towers and structures announced the location of our second new production facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, there is considerable growth potential in the utility infrastructure market with the need to expand and hardened transmission infrastructure while accelerating the connection of distributed renewable energy to the grid. As we evaluate and pursue new expand beyond platforms, we're focused on opportunities that leverage our core capability as an efficient industrial manufacturer and are aligned with steel-intensive mega trends or themes. Passage and implementation of the infrastructure bill, IRA and chips and Science Act are helping to drive these megatrends and Nucor intends to capitalize on them further to grow and diversify our earnings potential. The goal of our growth strategy is not simply about being the biggest steel company. It's about providing a differentiated capability set for our customers and creating long-term economic value for our shareholders. We aim to generate returns over the economic cycle comparable to the best manufacturing companies in the world. That's why we're seeking opportunities with attractive growth rates, stronger free cash flow, great synergy potential and more stable earnings profiles. Before turning it over to Steve, I'd like to provide some updates on our sustainability strategy. In May, we announced an MOU at NuScale to explore locating NuScale small module reactor power plants near certain Nucor steel mills. And in June, we announced a partnership with ExxonMobil to capture, transport, in-store CO2 emissions from our DRI plant in Louisiana. We believe this is the first carbon capture project of any DRI facility and will enable us to produce the lowest embodied carbon DRI in the world, even though our emissions intensity is already 60% lower than the global steelmaking average, Nucor continues to aggressively pursue strategies that further differentiate itself as the leader in sustainability for our industry. With that, let me turn it over to Steve, who will share additional details about our Q2 performance as well as our outlook for Q3. Steve?Stephen D. LaxtonThank you, Leon. Nucor just completed another terrific quarter. The company had consolidated net earnings of nearly $1.5 billion, resulting in a return on equity of 30% over the past 12 months. In fact, the second quarter of this year marks our ninth consecutive quarter where both net earnings exceeded $1 billion and return on equity exceeded 25%. These results highlight the advancement of our strategy and the growing earnings power of Nucor's diversified portfolio and industry-leading capabilities. It also demonstrates solid execution by the Nucor team and ongoing favorable conditions across important steel consuming end markets such as construction, automotive, energy and industrial equipment. At the segment level, our Steel Mills Group delivered $1.4 billion of pretax earnings in the second quarter, an increase of 68% over the first quarter. This was due to higher metal margins, especially at our sheet mills as gains on realized pricing and steel outpaced higher prices for both scrap and ore-based metallics. Second quarter steel shipments were similar to that as the first quarter. During the period, we realized slightly lower conversion costs, including lower energy rates. Turning to our Steel Products segment. We saw another period of outstanding performance with segment pretax earnings of just over $1 billion. We continue to realize attractive pricing and margins, even as some subsectors like warehouses continue to moderate from their historically high levels of 2022. While Nucor operates a diverse portfolio of downstream steel products, and some of the strongest contributions came from our joist and deck business and our pre-engineered metal buildings group. We also saw improved results in our rebar fabrication and Tubular Products businesses. In addition, as Leon mentioned, we've seen very positive contributions from our newly acquired Expand Beyond platform businesses. Our raw materials segment produced pretax earnings of $138 million for the quarter. Relative to the first quarter of the year, we realized higher volumes and pricing in both our DRI and recycling businesses. During the second quarter, we also continued to generate strong free cash flow, with cash from operations totaling $1.9 billion for the quarter and $3.1 billion year-to-date. This strong cash flow allowed Nucor to continue its balanced approach to capital allocation. In the second quarter, we deployed $525 million in capital expenditures as we continue to enhance and grow our core. We also returned $580 million to shareholders, including approximately $130 million in dividends and $450 million in share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've returned roughly 44% of our net earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Nucor's balance sheet strength continues to be a fundamental underpinning of our current and future success. At quarter end, Nucor had approximately $5.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, and our revolving credit facility remains undrawn. This strong liquidity position enables us to continue our balanced approach to capital allocation. Leon referenced the progress we're making on our $10 billion capital spending plan to leverage and grow our core but we still have significant spending in our largest project ahead of us. We expect capital spending related to our West Virginia sheet mill to accelerate in the near term as we begin the construction phase of this project. And as mentioned earlier, we continue to cultivate a viable pipeline of growth opportunities to expand into new adjacent businesses. Maintaining the strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity are centrally important to enabling and positioning Nucor for continued future success. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We currently expect consolidated earnings to be lower than the second quarter. At the segment level for the third quarter, we expect earnings from steel mills to decrease compared to the second quarter on stable shipments but lower margins as we've seen prices come down for sheet and, to a lesser extent, long products. In our Steel Products segment, we expect performance will continue to moderate from the record set earnings of recent quarters due to modestly lower pricing and stable volumes. For the raw materials segment, we expect lower earnings in the third quarter due to margin compression of our DRI and scrap processing operation. Overall, nonresidential construction remains elevated with especially strong activity from infrastructure spending, data centers and manufacturing. In addition, positive trends continue in the automotive and energy sectors. In short, we believe medium and long-term fundamentals of our industry and key demand drivers remain very healthy. This, coupled with our strategy to grow our core and expand beyond position Nucor for strength well into the future. With that, we'd like to hear from you and answer any questions you might have. Operator, please open the line for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Alex Hacking of Citi.Alexander Nicholas HackingI guess just my first question, just drilling down on demand a little bit. If we look at shipments of long steel, bars and structurals, it's down about 10% year-over-year. I guess what's driving that kind of year-on-year decline?Leon J. TopalianYes, Alex, I appreciate the question. As we look over the course of this year compared to last, we're coming off historic highs, historic backlogs in volumes. And so some of that's moderating. We're seeing, again, continued robust demand in many of those sectors, particularly around non-risk construction, auto advanced manufacturing and the like -- maybe provide a little more context on some of those long products and what we're seeing in the marketplace today.John J. HollatzAlex, this is John Hollatz. I'll speak specifically to long products. So you've got to keep in mind that when it comes to Nucor's long products portfolio, we have the most diverse offering of any long product company out there. We've got rebar, merchants, SBQ and rod, all mixed into those numbers. The rebar demand has remained steady. That's about even with where it was last year as we would expect where we've seen some declines on the rod side and on the SBQ. You've seen inventory buildups over the course of last year that have been making their way down over the course of this year, and we're feeling some impact of that. But again, the bigger portion of that is the rebar side, which remains very consistent.Alexander Nicholas HackingThanks Leon and John. And then I guess my second question, I guess, turning to the sheet side, shipments there modestly lower year-on-year despite adding 400,000 tons from Gallatin, and your peers have generally been reporting shipments higher year-on-year. Sitting on the outside, it looks like maybe Nucor is happy to concede a little bit of market share in the short term. Is that a fair assessment? Or is there kind of something else going on?Leon J. TopalianWell, yes. I appreciate that. And a couple of things to note. And again, context is important in a number of different aspects, not the least of which. The second quarter of last year was historic for Nucor in really our industries. And so at that time, we're peaking and setting records in about every category that you can imagine, including about 7 million tons of shipments in that quarter alone, 2.5 million of which was in our sheet group, and so what I would tell you is we look to Q2 of this year, we're not conceding market share. And in fact, we're growing some of that. And I'm going to ask Rex Query to touch base on a little bit -- give you a little bit more flavor of that. But Nucor is focused on providing a capability set out for our customers. Again, not just volume. But at the same time, we're not going to concede market share. We're going to be deliberate at how we ramp up. We've thought very deliberately about how we bring Gallatin on. I'm proud of what they and their team have done from a safety standpoint, from a reliability standpoint and again, really taking a complete brownfield revamp of that facility while delayed, I'm really proud of the efforts that the team has made and now profitable and running at full run rate level. So Rex will provide a little more clarity for Alex around that in our market share gains.K. Rex QueryYes, Alex, appreciate the question. As Leon mentioned, second quarter last year really was extremely high in volume. So it matters where you start at when you look at that from a just a relative tonnage standpoint. So you saw -- I would tell you, basically been stable. And as far as market share -- if you go back to that time frame versus now in the last year, we picked up a couple of points of market share. First quarter, we're up about 4 points in market share. So from that standpoint, we've grown at imports, have decreased slightly over that time. So from a standpoint of someone else growing, they're getting that from somewhere else, not from Nucor. At the same time, we're expanding our capabilities. So you're seeing us expand market share, but also expand our capabilities into our customers for higher quality products.OperatorThe next question comes from Timna Tanners of Wolfe Research.Timna Beth TannersI wanted to ask a bit more about your backlog. I know you talked about healthy backlogs. You alluded to some of the weakness in warehouses, but also talked about a healthy government program support. So just wondering if you could provide any further color recent warehouse starts have fallen over 50%. Have you seen much weakness yet? What are your customers saying there? And what are you seeing in terms of evidence of the government spending so far in your backlog?Leon J. TopalianYes. Thanks, Timna. I'll kind of start it because there's a few different prongs that I want to touch on and maybe ask John Hollatz to touch on some of the flow-through effects that we're already seeing in our order books. But I want to begin with the backdrop, right? If we pick a point in timeline June's numbers of a drop of 53%. If you look at the overall year average, it's about down 25%. And again, the 2023 overall forecast is 27% down year-over-year. But you're coming off, again, historic highs. However, June, I think what you're asking is June, an indicator that we've reached some difference in a bigger decline that's going to stay with us. I would tell you that it's not indicative of what we're seeing in our quoting data or backlog data. And as we talk to our customers, customers, the feedback and reports that we're getting is, again, pretty resilient through the rest of the year. So it is off 2022 peaks. But again, as we think about maybe a 2017 to '19 average, it is still significantly higher than that period of time. So John, maybe just provide a little context around what we're seeing in terms of the infrastructure chips and IRA flowing through our mills.John J. HollatzYes. Thank you, Leon. Timna, on the infrastructure bill, we're really seeing still design and budgetary work being done on those projects. So we expect that, that would flow our way probably more at the end of this year, beginning of 2024. On the chip side, those projects are currently in motion. They are sitting in our backlog. Some have actually have been delivered, and we're seeing the benefits of that specifically on the rebar and rebar fabrication side. You asked about backlogs, I'll touch on rebar fabrication. I'm really proud of what our team at Harris Rebar fab has done over the last year. We are comfortably going to have a record year in that business and the margin in our backlog right now is higher than it's been at any time in our history since we have owned this business. Our backlogs are down just slightly year-over-year. That's by design where we were coming off of a record backlog a year ago. But we're positioning ourselves because of our geographic footprint across the entire country to take advantage of this wave of work that continues to come with the chips act and the infrastructure bill.Timna Beth TannersOkay. Very helpful. If I could sneak another one in. I just wanted to kind of clarify. I sensed a couple of comments from you guys about potential interest in further downstream M&amp;A. Did I catch that right? And if so, can you elaborate on any of the criteria that you're looking for in markets geography? Anything that you want to provide would be great.Leon J. TopalianYes, Timna, I'll touch on that. And part of the expand beyond for us is a few filters that I'll share with you. One is a marriage up where we bring value as an industrial manufacturer, right? That there's something to -- that we bring to bear. We're not looking for disparate businesses, certainly not looking to become a conglomerate and again, having things that don't marry up or we don't bring value to. So that's one. The second is scalable with that we can maintain or grow into a market leadership position. Third is looking for adjacencies that operate somewhat out of the traditional cyclicality of the steel mill world, right? So how do we provide a more stable earnings profile through the long term. And again, the best example of that is our CHI overhead door business that is operated prior to us acquiring them at a 10% CAGR for 20 years. And so their stability in that earnings profile is something that we look for -- a lot is we're continuing to look. There are a lot of irons in the fire. I won't get specific into the sectors, but other than to say as we look at the mega trends that are happening in our industry in the long term, how do we continue to broaden that portfolio and again, increasing our value and capability set for customers and the returns for our shareholders.OperatorThe next question comes from Lawson Winder of Bank of America Securities.Lawson WinderI just wanted to start off with your commentary on steel products and for those to moderate in Q2. And ask whether you might be able to provide some more specific direction in terms of what moderation means? Like for example, would that be down like 2%, 5%, 10% versus Q2?Leon J. TopalianYes, Lawson, I appreciate the question. And I don't know we're prepared today to talk about that one and provide that exact in that one specific end market. What I would tell you as we look to Q3, we expect volumes to remain pretty stable. Again, we think that business segment is pretty resilient. And again, we do see some slight contraction on the overall pricing that's going to flow through. But again, at this time, I'm not going to provide any specific number.Lawson WinderOkay. That's fine. I mean, that's helpful what you've provided. And then I just also wanted to ask on Brandenburg. You continue to expect profitability in Q4. How does Q3 look? And then looking into 2024, how would you describe the profitability outlook for Brandenburg then?Leon J. TopalianYes. I'll ask Al Behr, our EVP over plate products to touch on it. I would just point out and tell you the excitement of Brandenburg to us internally and then to our customer segment in the marketplace has been extraordinary. It is the most diverse capable plate mill in the Western Hemisphere. The team has done a phenomenal job. Again, I shared earlier in my opening remarks about their ramp up and their ability today to produce 1 to 12 inches. Again, we're excited about being in the heartland of the largest plate-consuming region in the United States. Al, do you want to just maybe provide a little bit of insight into Q3 and that ramp up and again our expected profitability by Q4.Allen C. BehrYes. Thanks. And I don't know, Lawson, if I'm in a position to comment beyond on the profitability, what we've given you about achieving it in Q4. But I can talk a little bit about volumes as we look at the second half. And it's heavily weighted towards Q4. So of the 300,000 tons, I'd say you'd see 100,000 tons of that in Q3 and 200,000 tons of that in Q4. So that might help you to kind of pencil out what that looks like for the year. But as Leon said, we remain focused on the capabilities of that machine, which are extraordinary. We've hit several milestones even within the quarter over rolling a 12-inch finish plate. We've cast a 12-inch slab at that caster. We just continue to grow our capabilities in all the castingrolling and finishing breadth that, that plant can do. We're going to be strategic about rolling the tons out. We're going to be careful and thoughtful about it, but I've given you about the best estimate we have on how the second half would look.Lawson WinderThat's super helpful Al. And then when you think about profitability in that sector as well in terms of pricing, I mean, would you expect premium value-add pricing to start coming through in sort of 2024, just given the range of products that you guys will be producing there and the focus on those higher value-add products?Allen C. BehrYes. Well, with regard to pricing, ultimately, the market is going to decide the pricing and supply and demand dynamics do that. I would say Brandenburg is primarily a discrete plate mill and discrete plate does carry a premium over hot-rolled coil plate so that mix will be helpful as you look at just backlog pricing and overall mix pricing, but that's probably as much granularity as I could give you as we just look into the next year.OperatorThe next question comes from Bill Peterson of JPMorgan.William Chapman PetersonYou discussed some fundamental changes that helped improve the efficiencies in the metal buildings and rebar fabrication. I can recognize that customers are realizing value in the business, but can you elaborate more on, I guess, what you're doing internally, the internal efficiencies that led to the fundamental change? Or is there any room for further improvement down the road?Leon J. TopalianBill, I appreciate the question. Over the last couple of years, really 3, 4 years, we've taken some very, very strong looks in evaluating our own internal portfolio, where do we gain efficiencies? How do we do align certain operations? And we largely feel that the overall footprint today geographically where we're positioned as well as the product offering is a really good balance into the marketplace that in customer segment that we're attached to in the dealer networks that we continue to have support and ultimately supply into. So I would tell you on that internal footprint, I think we feel very well positioned with the moves we've made to date. And while there will be continued efficiency gains, there'll be more smaller in nature. We don't see at this time further consolidation or closures in the future.William Chapman PetersonOkay. I appreciate the color there. Maybe turning to CapEx. It looks like you spent a little more than $1 billion in the first half of the year. How should we think about the cadence of CapEx in the back half of the year, I guess, taking into account projects like the West Virginia site or any other projects?Stephen D. LaxtonBill, this is Steve. Thanks for the question on there. And the back half is definitely going to be a much heavier spend on CapEx. We've guided earlier in the year to an estimate of around $3 billion on the year. And of course, we spent only about $1 billion of that so far and the largest project that we have by far is West Virginia, and we're about to enter a phase of construction there. So that's going to -- in particular, that asset is going to ramp up rather quickly in the second half.OperatorYour next question comes from Carlos De Alba of Morgan Stanley.Carlos De AlbaYes. You mentioned that you saw lower cost conversion in the steel segment in the second quarter. I wonder if you can provide a little bit more color in terms of what do you expect for the third quarter, maybe the second half and what is driving those cost reductions? And then yes, I have a second question, if I may, after.Stephen D. LaxtonCarlos, this is Steve. I'll take that question. Generally, what you've seen since the midpoint roughly of last year is overall moderation in cost in general. And of course, that's been reflected in the CPI data and more broadly in the economy, and we're not any different than that. But in particular, energy is down around 20% year-over-year, for example. But you're seeing some moderation in freight cost and supplies and services in particular. Those are some areas we're seeing the biggest declines year-over-year in cost.Carlos De AlbaAnd do you expect the level of declines in the second half to remain close to the 20% so that you mentioned, for instance, on energy?Stephen D. LaxtonYes. I don't know that I would project further decline necessarily, but we're not seeing the increases that we saw last year.Carlos De AlbaAll right. Thanks Steve. And the other question I had is, so what we're seeing is that in terms of square footage, warehousing -- commercial warehousing construction is coming down, manufacturing plant is increasing, but your warehouse is just far, much bigger in terms of area than manufacturing plants, at least where we stand right now, infrastructure is also picking up. How quick -- I mean, how much exposure do you have to each one of these different segments between the nonresidential construction sector? And how quickly, for instance, if you had more exposure to the commercial warehousing, how quickly can you adapt your product mix? So you can sell more to those areas that are seeing expansions?Leon J. TopalianCarlos, simple answer to that. So starting with the back half of your question first, our ability to pivot is instantaneous. And so again, we're not making products for our own edification, it's to deliver solutions to our customers that again, now Nucor has an incredibly wide and diverse portfolio of year on the website or looking at that slide deck. Today, Nucor produces and supplies into that typical warehouse structure. About 90% of the steel intensity needs are already being met. But you also have to keep in mind, and I'm not going to detail out what individualized percentage of the overall portfolio. But the warehouse piece for us is only a small piece of the overall mix when you think about insulated metal panels racking the joist and deck, the buildings, the towers and the entire portfolio of what Nucor brings to bear, again, the overall matrix for Nucor and that revenue stream continues to look very robust. And so while you're seeing -- and you're right about the reduction in overall square footage, Nucor's earnings potential and you're seeing our volumes pretty stable. We think there's going to be a little bit of pressure as we get into Q3. But again, volumetrically, we have a very stable picture as we look out in the future. So again, I think it's going to be a strong year for Nucor in our total portfolio of our downstream products. But again, I'm not going to break out individual revenues for each of those components.OperatorThe next question comes from Cleve Rueckert of UBS.Cleveland Dodge RueckertI think a lot of it's been covered already. But Leon, I wanted to follow up on Timna's question and just curious to understand what, in your opinion, needs to happen for you to generate returns comparable to the best manufacturing companies in the world? I mean is this really about vertical integration? Or is there an opportunity to get there within your current business mix? And I'm just kind of curious what direction you are...Leon J. TopalianYes, look, sure. fair question. And again, as you think about that as a backdrop, it really goes back to our launch in my time of taking over as CEO, where we rolled out our mission statement to grow the core, expand beyond and live our culture. So the expand beyond piece was really the lens in which we're looking on, how do we continue to generate long-term growth and long-term earnings power for our shareholders. Part of that analysis and strategy has come back and embedded in the expand beyond that we are looking for businesses that generate more consistent through-cycle earnings profiles than the traditional cyclicality of the steel business. So at the heart of what we do well, we're an excellent industrial manufacturer. So part of that overall analysis and backdrop is, well, if you want to be comparative against the industrial manufacturers, we've got to bring our cyclicality of earnings closer together. We've got to provide a more stable return performance and profile to our shareholders. And so that's really where the entirety of our time to spend and looking at expand beyond and what businesses we want to onboard that fit the long-term profile for Nucor that does just that, again, stabilizes that through cycle performance and again, generating higher highs and higher lows for our shareholders.Cleveland Dodge RueckertYes. I appreciate that. I remember you had a slide kind of comparing the -- I think it was the HRC, margin versus the rebar margin in your Investor Day. So I guess, I'm just curious about whether you think you can achieve that margin stability in the steel industry? Or you need to kind of continue with the expand beyond strategy and...Leon J. TopalianYes. Look, fair enough. And so I think there's 2 things to think about there. One, we have seen substantive shifts in the industry. We've seen consolidation. We've seen rationalization, and we've seen a massive change in trade. If we go back 5 or 6 years ago in trade, for example, and we have 50 cases that the industry had won against bad actors that were legally dumping or subsidizing steels. Today, that's over 120. So while the overcapacity situation in the world will never ever be gone or advocacy has got to remain vigilant, Secretary Raimondo or Catherine Tai, USTR understand that incredibly well and are very supportive of the industry, as well as the manipulation that can occur. When you look at the consolidation or rationalization in our industry has created some outcomes that are much more advantageous that are stabilizing those earnings. So I think with that, we're going to get a much more consistent outflow. You saw back in November when we had our earnings day, our projected through-cycle EBITDA with the online of West Virginia. It's about $6.7 billion so that's the through cycle. So we expect peaks to be much higher. And quite frankly, we don't expect the troughs that we saw pre-pandemic to occur for us. Additionally, though they expand beyond sort of shores that up. It embeds in that. And again, go back to CHI, we bought it at 13x today with the performance that it's generated, it's calculating now more like a 9.2 or 3x on that EBITDA value. So they continue to perform because there are synergies inside of Nucor that are going to grow that platform in that business segment. Again, so together, I think that creates a very compelling case for why we believe we're one of the best industrial manufacturers and certainly in the industry, while we ought to be have a compelling story to trade at a higher multiple.Cleveland Dodge RueckertGot it. I appreciate that. And then just sort of one other follow-up on the demand side. We talked about it a little bit already, but you mentioned that the CHIPS Act is helping drive some rebar demand. On the infrastructure spending that's been very slow to develop, but it sounds like it's starting to kind of shift from planning to execution later this year. Where do you expect that to drive volumes within your portfolio? Is that again about rebar? I think in the past, we've talked about plate demand. Is it both? Do you see a skew oneway or the other as that spending gets unlocked?Leon J. TopalianYes, look, fair question. I think you're going to see it across our portfolio as you're going to see in plate, you're going to see it in longs and bar beams, you're going to see in joist and deck, you're going to see it in racking. You're going to see it through the Nucor warehouse systems group and again, that build-out. So I think there's going to be a fair distribution across Nucor's portfolio that's going to see an increase. The other thing to keep in mind Nucor's overall volume, about 50% of that flows through the construction end markets in some form or fashion, and that's targeting right in line with that all 3 pieces of those legislative investments from our nation and passages. So the decision Nucor sits in today across those spectrums are well suited to deliver those outcomes. But again, you're going to see that mix distributed fairly well across several of our product groups.OperatorThe next question comes from Tristan Gresser of BNP Paribas Exane.Tristan GresserIt's 2. the first one is basically a follow-up on rebar. It seems manufacturing investment is supporting rebar spread at the moment. And if I understand your comments earlier, we're still waiting for Infra to really kick in and that's the most rebar-intensive part, I believe. So my question, is Infra yet to flow through? Do you see any reason why rebar metal spreads should actually fall into H2? And also, how do you address the input risk? The arbs are clearly open. We've seen rebar imports picking up in recent months. If you could comment on that as well.Leon J. TopalianYes. I'll kick this off, Tristan, maybe ask John to make a few comments. But again, our longs businesses, in general, have been our most stable earnings performers over many, many years. And so as we look to the back half of the year, yes, there's some downward pressure. But again, the overall demand picture remains pretty robust. So we -- like you, I don't see this collapse in the second half of 2023 because, again, the underlying demand or backlog and again, having the breadth of exposure that we have, knowing the customers the way we do. We, again, think 2023 will shape up to be another very strong year for Nucor, again, our customers. John, anything you want to add on that? Because I don't know that I fully understood the second part of your question, Tristan, but any comments on the opening question?John J. HollatzYes, Tristan, ultimately, the market is going to demand margins on any products that we would produce, and we're going to monitor that closely to making sure that we're taking care of our customers. You had mentioned imports on rebar. Year-over-year, import volumes on rebar are down slightly. We've seen a reduction from Turkey. I think everyone's well aware of what's happening over there. You're seeing some increased volumes coming out of Algeria, Egypt and Mexico. But overall, the year-over-year, it's actually down by comparison.Tristan GresserOkay. So that's really helpful. So no real pressure of lates from imports. Okay. And my second question is pretty similar, is actually on plate. If you can discuss a little bit the demand outlook -- I mean it seems you haven't seen also the impact from higher infrastructure spending, which I think can benefit a lot in your plates business. But can you also discuss a little bit what you're expecting in terms of the ramp-up of offshore onshore wind in the U.S. and how could that carry you maybe in the back half of this year, but especially in years moving forward? And any type of pressure are you also seeing maybe on plate metal spread recent months in the near term?Allen C. BehrYes. Tristan, this is Al Behr. I'll speak a little bit to plate demand. When we just look at the general market. There are several areas of strength that we see carrying through the rest of the year. Ag and heavy equipment remain fairly strong. onshore wind has picked up with the passage of the IRA and brought some clarity to opportunities there, service center buying has picked up versus a year ago. So those are all tailwinds to demand. And we think the plate market will continue to be fairly strong through the rest of this year. You asked about offshore wind. That's certainly a big opportunity for plate, and we watch that closely. The easiest way I can tell you is it takes about 250 tons of steel for every megawatt of offshore wind put in place. So you really have to come back to what you think is going to be built in any period of time offshore, and there's a wide spread in those estimates, but it takes about 250 tons per megawatt to execute that. We don't see that coming this year or even much into next year. But I think it's a huge opportunity for plate that as the years beyond that start to play out, there's a lot of tons there, if you do that math. Closing up real quickly on the other infrastructure parts and the spending you asked about. We do see that in place. There is a lot of opportunity that creates in plate. We're starting to see that today with Bridge work, especially much more to come and it's just in its early stages, but that money on those opportunities are starting to present in the market.OperatorThe next question comes from Martin Englert of Seaport Research Partners.Martin John EnglertWanted to switch. There's been a lot of conversation about government spend and incentives, but about private sector and what's happening with manufacturing. What conversations are you having, if any, with customers that may be in the process of reshoring manufacturing or considering it in the future regarding their steel and metals needs when you think out several years ahead here?Leon J. TopalianYes. Maybe I'll kick it off and let Dan Needham our EVP over commercial, maybe give some broad context. But we're having a lot of those conversations and have actually for the last 1 year, 1.5 years about what does that look like? Again, with all the negatives of COVID, one of the things that it did and I believe in this country is it saw and showed our overdependence to foreign nations on many, many things, not just steel, but pharma and PPE and medical devices and the like -- and so you're seeing that move come back and you mentioned the semiconductors, and I'll touch on that and turn it over to Dan. But when we were running short on semiconductors, it obviously has massive impacts through the automotive sector, but others as well in HVAC and other industries that are dependent on those. So with the CHIPS and Science Act, $55 billion piece of legislation passed that now put to date, 34 projects on the books to be built in the United States, totaling $374 billion of build-out, very steel-intensive type buildings. And some of those individual are massive, $20 billion, $23 billion, $25 billion investments in single plants. So as we talk to those customers and the GCs and the architects and engineers, to partner with them. The size and scale of that reshoring effort is massive. It is not inconsequential. It is a significant overall volume of the ADC. But Dan, maybe just provide it as well another backdrop as we think about our customer interactions with infrastructure and IRA.Daniel R. NeedhamSure. Appreciate the question, Martin. If you think about the breadth of our capabilities today that we've talked about throughout this call, our ability to go into customers now today and give them opportunities or solutions around how we can help them with this reshoring is unbelievable. And that's what we're doing every day today. Taking advantage of that, having those conversations, leveraging our groups, what we call solutions, particularly construction solutions where we have technical capabilities. We have the breadth of our capabilities throughout Nucor to go in and provide solutions in a lot of ways, turnkey solutions to what they need going forward. So we're having many of those conversations today, and that's our focus as we go forward.Martin John EnglertOkay. And looking past the build-out of these facilities. So just taking it a step or 2 forward, I guess, if a semiconductor plant is built and producing, it's probably not moving the needle for steel and metals demand. I guess I'm curious maybe on the next step, what you're seeing as far as like steel and metals intensive consuming industries like after the build-out or if you're having customers that are talking to you about needs there, hey, we're reshoring whatever type of manufacturing facility that's going to be consuming more steel and what you're hearing there anecdotally.Leon J. TopalianYes. Martin, look, I think anecdotally, you're right. A single individual plant may not move the needle for Nucor at 30 million tons a year of capability and capacity. However, if you look at the aggregate, if you look at the next 10 years, which is really the cycle these legislative bills are built up on or you're talking about somewhere between 6 million and 8 million tons of steel demand annually for 10 years. Well, that's 7% or 8% of our overall ADC in this nation. And so it's not going to spike the United States as an industry to move from 105 million or 110 million tons of steel consumed to 180 or 190 but it's a strong indication of a long-term trend that's going to be here. But the other pieces of that, and I think at the heart of your question are -- hey what are those regions that Nucor is positioning itself to offer? Well, one of those, for example, is towers and structures. That is a massive growing industry. We've announced our small acquisition with some in industries we're very excited about. We just announced our 2 greenfield plants that are going to be built to continue to ramp that business up and growing it because every one of those transmission lines, every one of those towers and structures are individually designed by the utility themselves. So again, with our breadth of exposure and engineering and pipeline, we marry up really, really well to serve that industry and that market again for a long period of time. So while the individual plan, you're right, may not move the needle. You're also talking about a decade worth of work. So this is not short term in the legislative side, but the other investment piece that you're seeing at Nucor is to identify those megatrends that will be growth platforms, again, for many, many years to come that are outside of those legislative windows as well. Automotive being another one, energy and renewables out touched on the plate. We are the only producer in the Western Hemisphere that can make the monopiles for the offshore wind, what position does that line Brandenburg up for the long term build-out of the renewable sector in this nation. So there are many of those industries that we're coupling and again, building capability sets today because that's where we know the industry is moving.Stephen D. LaxtonMartin, I'd just add one thing to what Leon said, anytime you see manufacturing growth, there's a multiplier effect in the economy, and there's a rippling and cascading effect for years to come. So all the jobs to get created from those various investments create follow-on subsequent investments, things like schools, housing, nonrisk construction group, and that typically shows up a number of years later and has -- like I said, a cascading sort of effect. So that CHIPS Act will promlogate an awful lot of value for new form in the steel industry over along period of time.Martin John EnglertThat's a fair point. I appreciate you highlighting that. One quick follow-up. On the Towers &amp; Structures business, if you look through the supply chain there. Are there any other adjacent businesses that make sense to pair up with that? Were there be synergies and potential scale and -- fits the framework that you previously detailed for the beyond strategy here? Or is it more so, the steel on the supply chain that's kind of fits with that and some engineering capabilities and then it's right to the customer and there's not something more vertical or horizontal that might pair up with it?Leon J. TopalianWell, now we need to bring you in the executive strategy session we have. So the answer is yes to the all of the above as Nucor and Chad Utermark leads our new markets and innovations team, the towers instructors team, the M&amp;A team are all sitting down, identifying and doing exactly what you just shared. Where are the trends? Where are the supporting structures? ""Pun"" intended, to augment this business to continue to provide adjacencies where we believe there is value to be added. We're doing the same thing as you look at the slides on the warehouse buildings and structures where else can Nucor marry up. So as Dan Needham pointed out, we can walk in with a complete packaged solution for our customer set. We're doing the same thing in automotive. And you'll see in the coming months that will release the same type of slide that does the cross section of the automobile. Where are we today? What are we targeting and where will we be in the next 3 to 5 years because our anticipation is that we're going to double our volumes into the automotive industry. West Virginia, for example, is targeting about roughly 1/3 of their overall mix to be in automotive that from an individual plant standpoint would be the largest volume per capita into that sector. So again, we've got a lot of plans built into how we continue to grow this company and where we're going to position it for future growth.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Leon Topalian for any closing remarks.Leon J. TopalianThank you. And I want to thank the Nucor team for delivering a great and safe first half of our year. Let's continue to make sure we take care of our most important value, the health, safety and well-being of the entire 31,000 Nucor team member family. Thank you to our customers as well and allowing us the privilege to serve you with each and every order. And finally, thank you to our shareholders for the trust that you've placed in us to be great stewards of the valuable shareholder capital that you've entrusted us with. Thank you for your interest in Nucor, and have a great day.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.]"

Nucor CEO Leon Topalian tells Yahoo Finance Live that ""underlying demand continues to be very resilient,"" citing strength from the automotive, energy, and advanced manufacturing datacenter industries. Topalian says they are still watching housing, but notes that ""consumer spending continues to be strong."" Topalian also highlights the benefit the company is seeing from infrastructure legislation, saying its something he hasn't seen during his time in steelmaking.Video Transcript- Steel giant Nucor blew away profit estimates today on the back of strong demand from auto and other industrial end markets, CEO Leon Topalian told me. Here's what Nucor's top leader says about his company's longer term outlook.LEON TOPALIAN: Nucor's continued position for growth is in our platforms for our investment and capital allocation are paying dividends for our shareholders. You know, we earn $5.81, as you know, EPS for the quarter. $10.26 for the year. So it's our second strongest start of any year in our history. So again, with all the looming fears and talk about recessions, Nucor continues to take care of our shareholders, our customers, and our team, Brian.- Take us through this earnings report, Leon. What stood out to me-- steel mill profit margins up. Why would that be the case?LEON TOPALIAN: You know, again, underlying demand continues to be very resilient. So we're seeing sectors like automotive, energy, within oil and gas renewables. The advanced manufacturing data centers, all continue to be areas of strength. And Nucor is one of the most diversified steel producers in North America. It's well positioned, well poised to capitalize on that. And again, you're seeing that kind of flow through in our earnings portfolio. Free cash flow is generated, EBITDA generated. And that, you know, again, is a part of a long-term investment strategy.- Within those industries you just mentioned, where are you seeing some of the strongest demand? And are you seeing any signs of slowing anywhere as it pertains to the top line?Story continuesLEON TOPALIAN: Again, thinking about Nucor's breadth, right? We're the largest steelmaker in North America, the most diversified. So there are parts of the portfolio that are not as strong as the 2020 peak years. But again, 2022 has to be viewed through the lens of context. So it was the peak year. Record highs across the board. And so, for example, in warehousing, still very strong. But off 15% to 16% year over year.However, pre-pandemic, it's up 60% or 70%. So again, the segments of that remain incredibly resilient. But automotive continues to be very strong. The advanced manufacturing and our warehousing data centers year over year are predicted to be up. So we're seeing that. Renewables, offshore wind. Oil and gas continues to be a area of strength. So those are the markets that, again, are showing signs of improvement or strengthening.- Within your outlook for this year, Leon, do you see a rebound happening in the US housing market?LEON TOPALIAN: You know, that's a great question. And like everyone else, we continue to watch. And when we started 2023, all the pundits were talking about the recession. And again, we'll see if that comes or not. But GDP forecasts in Q1 was predicting a Q2 GDP of 0.3. Obviously, much, much stronger.I think that continues throughout the rest of the year. How much of a rebound, we'll see. You know, I don't want to predict right now. But again, I think there's some consumer spending continues to be strong. And so we're seeing sectors of this economy that remain very resilient. On top of which, there's another aspect of that that we've not seen, certainly in my time in steelmaking.And that is the amount of money being put into this economy through legislation. The CHIPS and Science Act, IRA infrastructure, are things that, in spite some interest rates and some, again, talk of a recession remain incredibly robust and are bringing things into our sector that, again, Nucor is well positioned and capitalized to execute on.- Now you brought up some very good points, and I want to get to that. But in terms of just the costs of doing business, are you confident in saying that inflation has peaked? We're hearing that tone start to emerge this earnings season. I think a lot of investors haven't heard that from CEOs in two plus years. Can you say that?LEON TOPALIAN: You know, look, I would tell you that we're a margin business. And so, at the end of the day, we're not immune to some of the influxes of the supplies and services. But most of our uses are coming within the United States or certainly within North America. So we did not have the exposure to other nations and other countries like some manufacturing sectors did.So I think by and large, that's tamed and certainly, again, part of our mix as we predict and estimate for the rest of the year. We think it'll be a good, very solid year for Nucor.- You mentioned legislation, and I think that is very important to the steel industry. As you take a step back, you had the Trump administration put tariffs on China, China steel. That seemingly good for US steelmakers. But then, as you just mentioned, we had all this stimulus from the Biden administration from various different avenues. Which administration has been better for your business?LEON TOPALIAN: You know, again, Nucor has been well positioned. We've been advocates for fair trade, not free trade, for a very, very long time in our company. And again, you've seen five, six years ago, the industry only had about 50 or 60 cases that we had won against bad actors that were illegally dumping or subsidizing their steels. Today, that's more like 120.So we have great protections, and both sides of the aisle have been very supportive of the industry, including President Biden, Secretary Raimondo, Katherine Tai, our USTR. So there's strength there. And again, it-- I don't think it can be overstated. Just the CHIPS and Science Act alone. Today, there are 34 semiconductor facilities planned to be built in the United States for a total cost of around $374 billion.That is a massive influx of steel demand, steel intensive buildings, that at Nucor is, again, continuing as one of the safest, cleanest, most productive steelmakers in the planet to serve and continue to serve our customer base.- Is it fair to say, then, you know, because of those tariffs, that China is no longer dumping steel in the US?LEON TOPALIAN: That's correct to say directly. But again, the sort of whac-a-mole game continues to be played. And so those steels are moved to other nations. Potentially manufactured or fabricated and having some downstream process that would remove them from the trade barrier or case that they were originally cited.So do those steels move to Vietnam or other nations? Do they move to Mexico or Canada and then into the United States? So our advocacy, our vigilance in making sure the administration is aware of the policies and the things affecting our nation in a world of oversupply will remain part of our focus for decades and decades to come.- In terms of the stimulus plans infiltrating the US economy, what inning do you think we're in, and how do you think they shape your earnings in 2024?LEON TOPALIAN: Yeah, we're really at the front end of that. But it's happening. We're seeing on the order books now. Those orders are generating actual production in our plants today. And but again, we're on the front end of that. But the stimulus you've talked about, they're 10-year investment cycles. So we're going to continue to see that move up.And again, very constructive-- construction intensive. So as you think about the products that we make and the rebar plate, sheet grades, steel beams, joist, deck, metal-- insulated metal panels, all of those things are uniquely brought together by our solutions group and will continue to help serve that-- those end markets incredibly well and ultimately reward our shareholders with continued improved profits.- And that was Nucor CEO Leon Topalian.]"

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.28% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.08%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 5.28%.Coming into today, shares of the insurance company had gained 5.59% in the past month. In that same time, the Finance sector gained 8%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.86%.Unum will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 1, 2023. On that day, Unum is projected to report earnings of $1.87 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 2.09%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.07 billion, up 0.84% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.50 per share and revenue of $12.29 billion. These totals would mark changes of +20.77% and +2.38%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Unum should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.16% higher within the past month. Unum is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Unum has a Forward P/E ratio of 6.52 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 12.21, which means Unum is trading at a discount to the group.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that UNM currently has a PEG ratio of 0.78. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.

24,3b2a50d6-2a60-3cab-af4c-c723203b1baf,UNM,2023-07-26,Unum (UNM) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unum-unm-great-momentum-stock-160006407.html,1690300806,STORY,['UNM'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Unum (UNM), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Unum currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if UNM is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this insurance company holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor UNM, shares are up 3.05% over the past week while the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry is up 3.05% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 5.59% compares favorably with the industry's 4.37% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Unum have risen 16.95%, and are up 48.69% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 10.51% and 16.61%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to UNM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. UNM is currently averaging 987,434 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with UNM.Over the past two months, 6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost UNM's consensus estimate, increasing from $7.41 to $7.50 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that UNM is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Unum on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

25,3e03384d-81b3-322e-ad2e-88814912084f,UNM,2023-07-26,Unum (UNM) Upgraded to Buy: Here's What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unum-unm-upgraded-buy-heres-160005412.html,1690300805,STORY,['UNM'],"[Investors might want to bet on Unum (UNM), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Unum basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Unum imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for UnumFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this insurance company is expected to earn $7.50 per share, which is a change of 20.8% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Unum. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 10.7%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Unum to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

26,09fd4e45-d4f6-38d9-9df0-0d16e43d2c7d,UNM,2023-07-26,Analysts Estimate Unum (UNM) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-unum-unm-report-140137040.html,1690293697,STORY,['UNM'],"[The market expects Unum (UNM) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.87 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.1%.Revenues are expected to be $3.07 billion, up 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.01% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Unum?For Unum, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.04%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Unum will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Unum would post earnings of $1.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.87, delivering a surprise of +13.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Unum doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is Unum Group (UNM). UNM is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 6.34. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 10.66. Over the past year, UNM's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.46 and as low as 5.47, with a median of 6.39.UNM is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.76. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. UNM's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.87. Over the last 12 months, UNM's PEG has been as high as 1.03 and as low as 0.42, with a median of 0.61.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is UNM's P/B ratio of 1.04. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.83. Over the past year, UNM's P/B has been as high as 1.06 and as low as 0.65, with a median of 0.92.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. UNM has a P/S ratio of 0.8. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.26.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that UNM has a P/CF ratio of 5.96. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. UNM's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 7.26. Over the past 52 weeks, UNM's P/CF has been as high as 6.40 and as low as 4.71, with a median of 5.62.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Unum Group's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, UNM looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We also report Core organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing revenue, and excluding the impacts of acquisitions and currency translation. We report these measures because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company’s short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency translation and/or COVID-19 testing on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses these measures to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods.We report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company’s core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable:Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.Costs/income associated with restructuring activities and large-scale abandonments of product lines, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.Equity in earnings/losses of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies.The tax impacts of the above items and the impact of significant tax audits or events (such as changes in deferred taxes from enacted tax rate/law changes), the latter of which we exclude because they are outside of our normal operations and difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.We report free cash flow, which is operating cash flow excluding net capital expenditures, to provide a view of the continuing operations’ ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. The company also uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.Thermo Fisher Scientific does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort items such as the timing and amount of future restructuring actions and acquisition-related charges as well as gains or losses from sales of real estate and businesses, the early retirement of debt and the outcome of legal proceedings. The timing and amount of these items are uncertain and could be material to Thermo Fisher Scientific’s results computed in accordance with GAAP.The non-GAAP financial measures of Thermo Fisher Scientific’s results of operations and cash flows included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for Thermo Fisher Scientific’s results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the tables above.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230725979210/en/ContactsMedia Contact Information:Sandy PoundThermo Fisher ScientificPhone: 781-622-1223E-mail: sandy.pound@thermofisher.comInvestor Contact Information:Rafael TejadaThermo Fisher ScientificPhone: 781-622-1356E-mail: rafael.tejada@thermofisher.com]"
31,20165a84-ff60-3f4a-84aa-6dfe70ffa00b,TMO,2023-07-26,"MedTech Stocks' Q2 Earnings Due on Jul 26: DGX, TMO and More",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtech-stocks-q2-earnings-due-150500123.html,1690297500,STORY,"['DGX', 'EW', 'TMO', 'ALGN']","[The second-quarter earnings season for the Medical sector has kicked off. Per the latest Earnings Preview, quarterly results so far have improved year over year despite the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in the form of worldwide inflationary pressure and unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. Going by the sector’s scorecard, 3.4% of the companies in the Medical sector, constituting 12.3% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings till Jul 19. Of these, 100% beat earnings and revenue estimates. Earnings improved 9.3% year over year on 14% higher revenues.However, overall, second-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to plunge 18.6% despite 3.4% revenue growth. This compares with the first-quarter earnings decline of 17.9% on revenue growth of 4%.The projection reflects the ongoing global inflationary pressure, which has resulted in an extremely tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, putting the industry in a tight spot again. The majority of the players within this space witnessed a rise in raw material costs and other expense pressure through the second-quarter months. Added to this, labor-supply constraints due to an increase in labor costs and global supply-chain hazards are expected to have moderated the growth process.MedTech Quarterly SynopsysReplicating the market-wide trend, MedTech or the Zacks-defined Medical Products companies’ collective business growth in the second quarter is likely to have been significantly dampened by the ongoing macroeconomic threat in the United States and outside. Through the second-quarter months, the companies, which are into international trade, are expected to have faced severe currency headwind. During this period, the U.S. dollar remained strong compared to several foreign currencies, which is expected to have had an unfavorable impact on sales.Further, in Medical Device, going by the industry-wide trend, logistical challenges and increasing unit costs are likely to have weighed heavily on the corporate profitability of stocks across the board. On the other hand, the tightened monetary policy starkly altered consumer preferences and once again put the demand for the non-essential category line of medical device businesses on the back foot. This might have, in a way, shrunk the companies’ revenues in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter.Story continuesAlso, diagnostic testing companies might have shown a severe year-over-year decline in testing demand, compared to a strong comparison in the year-ago period on the rise in new cases in select geographies.Medical device companies like Quest Diagnostics DGX, Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO, Edwards Lifesciences EW and Align Technology ALGN are likely to have been influenced by these abovementioned factors in the second quarter.On a positive note, companies’ successful addressing of a couple of years’ pent-up demand is likely to have led to higher year-over-year growth within the legacy base businesses. During the post-pandemic phase, the key focus of medical device R&amp;D has again shifted from COVID-related PPE, testing and distant care options to point-of-care testing, heavy as well as minimally invasive implants, elective procedures and so forth. Accordingly, legacy base business recovery and testing demand of the companies through the months of the second quarter are expected to have been impressive. Meanwhile, AI and robotics for the medical Internet of Things (IoT), which rose to the limelight during the pandemic phase, remained popular.Let's take a look at four MedTech players scheduled to announce second-quarter results on Jul 26.Quest Diagnostics: During the first quarter of 2023, Quest Diagnostics’ COVID-19 testing revenues nosedived to a large extent, with the continuous decline in testing volumes. The company witnessed a downward trend in the demand for COVID-19 molecular testing volumes earlier than anticipated. For the remaining half of the year, Quest Diagnostics’ revised guidance assumes modest COVID-19 revenues following the end of the public health emergency in May. This is likely to be reflected in the second-quarter results.(Read more: Quest Diagnostics to Post Q2 Earnings: What's in Store?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $2.24 billion for the second quarter suggests an 8.6% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for DGX’s earnings of $2.23 per share indicates a 5.5% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Per our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates. This is not the case as you can see below.DGX has an Earnings ESP of -0.95% and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

The company is expected to have recorded growth, driven by a favorable business mix and new launches. The launch of Invitrogen DynaGreen — microplastic-free magnetic beads for protein purification — backed by strong customer adoption, is also expected to have contributed to the second-quarter top line.(Read more: What's in Store for Thermo Fisher in Q2 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Thermo Fisher’s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $10.99 billion, which implies a rise of 0.2% from the year-ago figure.

When language translations aren't done with the proper nuance, some phrases can potentially confuse customers, and that's something that Alicia Lopez and the translation team she leads work to avoid.""Our team helps customers learn about things they may not have ever experienced before, like the mortgage application process, what a down payment is or what escrow means,"" Lopez said. ""We want to make sure we never mislead our customers, and we also need to make sure our work follows all UDAAP (Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices) laws and regulations.""After English, the most common language of preference among U.S. Bank customers is Spanish, but people from different places often speak different Spanish dialects.""The Hispanic segment in the United States is such a melting pot of cultures,"" Lopez said. ""People here can have Mexican heritage, like me, or El Salvador, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Argentina, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Spain, you name it.""Because of that, the team focuses on what it has labeled as Spanish for the U.S., which takes different nuances into account.""It's a more universal vocabulary that's not specific to one country, and sometimes there's some liberty to have English words in parentheses,"" she said.The second most common non-English language of preference among U.S. Bank customers is Chinese. Because of the December 2022 acquisition of MUFG Union Bank, which was owned by Japan-based MUFG, Japanese has become the third most common, followed by Vietnamese, Lopez said.While those languages make up the bulk of the translation team's work, the team translates some 3,000 pieces a year spanning numerous languages.Story continues""Some of the requests we get include Somali, Hmong, Korean, Haitian Creole, Polish, Ukrainian and Marshallese, which is spoken in the Marshall Islands,"" she said.The team has in-house expertise in Spanish, Chinese and Japanese, and relies on vendors to manage translations for other languages.Every translation project goes through a rigorous compliance review process to ensure that it provides accurate and properly nuanced information before it is certified, she said.That process can include a ""back translation"" review where, for example, a piece that is translated from English to Haitian Creole will be given to another Haitian Creole translation expert to translate back to English without seeing the original version. Then the two English versions are compared for accuracy.""If you end up with something that's very close to the original English but doesn't have all the right nuances, the translation can be rejected,"" Lopez said. ""When that happens, we go back to the drawing board. We're passionate about what we do, and we believe it's important to provide customers with high-quality translations.""As someone who focuses on translations in her job, Lopez said she was interested in seeing the new, U.S. Bank-funded Translators documentary, which focuses on children who translate bills, medical advice and more for their parents.""When my mom was a child and my grandfather had an accident at work, she lost a year of high school to serve as his translator for medical appointments and important documents,"" Lopez said. ""The documentary really hit home on how at a young age some people are put into more adult situations and sometimes have to make sacrifices to help their family.""Providing translations for the bank's customers gives Lopez and her team great satisfaction, she said.""We take a lot of pride in the work we do,"" she said. ""There's more to accomplish but it's been so rewarding to use some of the products ourselves and to hear from bankers, customers, and family and friends that they think the quality is top-notch.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/770176/Making-Sure-Language-Translations-Are-Clear-and-Nuanced-for-Customers]"

38,20165a84-ff60-3f4a-84aa-6dfe70ffa00b,EW,2023-07-26,"MedTech Stocks' Q2 Earnings Due on Jul 26: DGX, TMO and More",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtech-stocks-q2-earnings-due-150500123.html,1690297500,STORY,"['DGX', 'EW', 'TMO', 'ALGN']","[The second-quarter earnings season for the Medical sector has kicked off. Per the latest Earnings Preview, quarterly results so far have improved year over year despite the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in the form of worldwide inflationary pressure and unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. Going by the sector’s scorecard, 3.4% of the companies in the Medical sector, constituting 12.3% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings till Jul 19. Of these, 100% beat earnings and revenue estimates. Earnings improved 9.3% year over year on 14% higher revenues.However, overall, second-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to plunge 18.6% despite 3.4% revenue growth. This compares with the first-quarter earnings decline of 17.9% on revenue growth of 4%.The projection reflects the ongoing global inflationary pressure, which has resulted in an extremely tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, putting the industry in a tight spot again. The majority of the players within this space witnessed a rise in raw material costs and other expense pressure through the second-quarter months. Added to this, labor-supply constraints due to an increase in labor costs and global supply-chain hazards are expected to have moderated the growth process.MedTech Quarterly SynopsysReplicating the market-wide trend, MedTech or the Zacks-defined Medical Products companies’ collective business growth in the second quarter is likely to have been significantly dampened by the ongoing macroeconomic threat in the United States and outside. Through the second-quarter months, the companies, which are into international trade, are expected to have faced severe currency headwind. During this period, the U.S. dollar remained strong compared to several foreign currencies, which is expected to have had an unfavorable impact on sales.Further, in Medical Device, going by the industry-wide trend, logistical challenges and increasing unit costs are likely to have weighed heavily on the corporate profitability of stocks across the board. On the other hand, the tightened monetary policy starkly altered consumer preferences and once again put the demand for the non-essential category line of medical device businesses on the back foot. This might have, in a way, shrunk the companies’ revenues in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter.Story continuesAlso, diagnostic testing companies might have shown a severe year-over-year decline in testing demand, compared to a strong comparison in the year-ago period on the rise in new cases in select geographies.Medical device companies like Quest Diagnostics DGX, Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO, Edwards Lifesciences EW and Align Technology ALGN are likely to have been influenced by these abovementioned factors in the second quarter.On a positive note, companies’ successful addressing of a couple of years’ pent-up demand is likely to have led to higher year-over-year growth within the legacy base businesses. During the post-pandemic phase, the key focus of medical device R&amp;D has again shifted from COVID-related PPE, testing and distant care options to point-of-care testing, heavy as well as minimally invasive implants, elective procedures and so forth. Accordingly, legacy base business recovery and testing demand of the companies through the months of the second quarter are expected to have been impressive. Meanwhile, AI and robotics for the medical Internet of Things (IoT), which rose to the limelight during the pandemic phase, remained popular.Let's take a look at four MedTech players scheduled to announce second-quarter results on Jul 26.Quest Diagnostics: During the first quarter of 2023, Quest Diagnostics’ COVID-19 testing revenues nosedived to a large extent, with the continuous decline in testing volumes. The company witnessed a downward trend in the demand for COVID-19 molecular testing volumes earlier than anticipated. For the remaining half of the year, Quest Diagnostics’ revised guidance assumes modest COVID-19 revenues following the end of the public health emergency in May. This is likely to be reflected in the second-quarter results.(Read more: Quest Diagnostics to Post Q2 Earnings: What's in Store?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $2.24 billion for the second quarter suggests an 8.6% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for DGX’s earnings of $2.23 per share indicates a 5.5% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Per our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates.

The company is expected to have recorded growth, driven by a favorable business mix and new launches. The launch of Invitrogen DynaGreen — microplastic-free magnetic beads for protein purification — backed by strong customer adoption, is also expected to have contributed to the second-quarter top line.(Read more: What's in Store for Thermo Fisher in Q2 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Thermo Fisher’s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $10.99 billion, which implies a rise of 0.2% from the year-ago figure.

An increase in hospital visits with an improvement in the market scenario is likely to have benefited HemoSphere sales, thus adding to the top line.

45,0f4c1199-7f1c-3432-aab3-60fb3c190946,RJF,2023-07-26,What's in the Card for Raymond James (RJF) in Q3 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-card-raymond-james-rjf-122900432.html,1690288140,STORY,['RJF'],"[Raymond James RJF is slated to announce third-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30) results on Jul 26, after market close. Quarterly earnings and revenues are expected to have witnessed a rise on a year-over-year basis.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were adversely impacted by a rise in expenses, disappointing investment banking (IB) performance and higher bank loss provision for credit losses. Yet, higher interest income, a rise in loan demand and past acquisitions acted as tailwinds.Raymond James has a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, the surprise being 0.14%, on average.Raymond James Financial, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRaymond James Financial, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRaymond James Financial, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Raymond James Financial, Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal third-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.07, which has moved 1.9% lower over the past 30 days. The figure indicates growth of 28.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for adjusted earnings is pegged at $2.04, implying a 26.9% improvement.The consensus estimate for sales of $2.89 billion suggests 6.2% year-over-year growth. We expect net revenues to be the same as the consensus number.Factors to Note for Q3Investment Banking Fees: Global deal-making continued to slump on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, though green shoots were visible toward the end of the quarter. A host of factors like geopolitical tensions, stand-off over the U.S. debt ceiling, inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a global recession acted as major headwinds. Thus, both deal volume and total deal value crashed in the fiscal third quarter, because of which Raymond James’ advisory fees are likely to have been hurt.For similar reasons, the equity market performance was disappointing in the to-be-reported quarter and thus, IPOs and follow-up equity issuances dried up. On the other hand, bond issuance volumes witnessed a slight improvement. Nonetheless, RJF’s underwriting fees are expected to have been negatively impacted in the quarter.The consensus estimate for IB fees is pegged at $163.7 million, suggesting a 26.6% plunge on a year-over-year basis. We anticipate IB fees of $196.9 million.Trading Revenues: Unlike the past few quarters, when huge market volatility and client activity drove trading revenues, capital markets were subdued in the to-be-reported quarter. The Congressional debate over the debt ceiling, risks of an economic downturn/recession, the Federal Reserve’s hawkish monetary policy stance to stem out “sticky” inflation and geopolitical concerns led to ambiguity among investors.These factors resulted in lower volatility in equity markets and other asset classes, including commodities, bonds and foreign exchange. So, Raymond James’ trading revenues are likely to have been subdued.Net Interest Income: Lending activities slowed down in the to-be-reported quarter. Continuing with its efforts to curb inflation, the Fed raised the interest rates by another 25 basis points in May before pausing the hike in the June FOMC meeting. The policy rate is now at a 15-year high of 5-5.25%.While this is likely to have had a favorable impact on RJF’s net interest income (NII), the inversion of the yield curve in the June-ended quarter and higher deposit costs are expected to have weighed on it to some extent.Our estimate for interest income stands at $754.4 million, suggesting a substantial jump from the prior-year quarter.Expenses: Raymond James consistently hires advisors and invests in franchises. Thus, overall expenses are expected to have risen in the quarter. Also, due to a highly competitive environment, costs might have been elevated.We project total non-interest expenses to be $2.34 billion, implying a 1.7% increase.Story continuesManagement’s Q3 ExpectationsThe company expects combined NII and RJBDP fees from third-party banks to decline sequentially due to a decrease in third-party RJBDP fees, given the lower average balances with third-party banks.Management expects the bank segments net interest margin to contract from the prior quarter, given the higher level of cash balances it plans to maintain during the volatile period as well as the impact from higher cost diversified funding sources.What the Zacks Model PredictsAccording to our proven model, the chances of Raymond James beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Raymond James is +0.61%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Other Finance Stocks Worth a LookA couple of other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time:The Earnings ESP for OneMain Holdings, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Safety and Industrial segment revenues was $2,865.25 million.Revenues from Transportation &amp; Electronics totaled $2,191 million, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 3.4%. The decline is attributable to a 1.3% adverse impact from movements in foreign currencies. Divestitures had a negative impact of 1.3%, while acquisitions benefited segmental revenues by 0.5%. Organic sales declined 1.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Transportation &amp; Electronics segment revenues was pegged at $1975.34 million. Revenues from Health Care were $2,075 million, down 4.8% year over year.

Research, development and related expenses were nearly flat at $473 million.In the second quarter, 3M reported an operating loss of $8.95 billion against the operating income of $110 million in the year-ago period. The downside was due to pre-tax charges of $10.3 billion related to its settlement with PWS on PFAS.MMM’s adjusted operating income in the quarter dropped 14.5% year over year to $1,545 million. The adjusted operating margin was 19.3% compared with 21.6% in the year-ago quarter.

The company expects adjusted earnings of $8.60-$9.10 per share for the current year compared with $8.50-$9.00 anticipated earlier. The mid-point of the guided range — $8.85 — lies above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.73.Adjusted total sales are expected to decline 1-5% from the year-ago period.

Price and EPS SurpriseRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. price-eps-surprise | Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Quote Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up for the quarter to be reported.Factors at PlayRoyal Caribbean’s second-quarter top line is expected to have increased year over year on the back of improvements in booking activities, strong pricing environment and continued strength from onboard revenue areas. Robust demand, courtesy of its digital initiatives, ship upgrades and enhanced product offerings are likely to have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter passenger ticket revenues and onboard and other revenues is currently pegged at $2,284 million and $1,109 million, respectively, indicating growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figures of $1,418 million and $766 million.Our model estimates second-quarter passenger ticket revenues to rise 41.4% year over year to $2,004.8 million. We expect onboard and other revenues to rise 67.3% year over year to $1,281.3 million.The improvement in load factors (courtesy of a rise in close-in bookings at higher prices) are likely to have paved a path for yield improvements in the second quarter. The company anticipates net yields to rise 9.6-10.1% (on a reported basis) and 10.1-10.6% (constant-currency basis) from 2019 levels. Our model predicts second-quarter net yields at $234.8 million (on a reported basis) and $239 million (constant-currency basis).Elevated costs concerning fuel and food are likely to have hurt margins in the second quarter. Our model predicts total cruise operating costs to rise 5.8% year over year to $1,788.6 million.The company expects net cruise costs (excluding fuel per APCD) for 2023 to increase 8.6% (on a reported basis) and 8.9% (constant currency) in the to-be-reported quarter. Per our model, second-quarter net cruise costs (excluding fuel per APCD) is estimated at $117.4 million (on a reported basis) and $118.3 million (constant-currency basis).Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Royal Caribbean this time around.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. MGM Resorts (MGM) earns a Zacks Rank #2 eight days from its next quarterly earnings release on August 2, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.63 a share.MGM Resorts' Earnings ESP sits at 19.43%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.63 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.53.MGM is part of a big group of Consumer Discretionary stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at DraftKings (DKNG) as well.DraftKings is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on August 3, 2023. DKNG's Most Accurate Estimate sits at -$0.23 a share nine days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DraftKings is -$0.25, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 6.6%.Story continuesMGM and DKNG's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $4.82 billion, up 8.8% year over year.Factors to NoteLive Nation Entertainment’s top line is likely to have benefited from pent-up demand for live events, robust ticket sales, and sponsorship and advertising business. The company continues to gain from a rise in average per-fan spending and an increase in ticket pricing.In second-quarter 2023, our model predicts concerts as well as sponsorship and advertising revenues to increase 3.9% and 20.3% year over year to $3,737.7 million and $317.3 million, respectively. Also, we expect ticketing revenues to improve 4.8% year over year to $603.1 million.However, higher expenses due to increased labor-hiring costs, artist activation costs and other operational expenses are likely to have hurt LYV’s bottom line in the quarter to be reported. Also, it has been witnessing a rise in venue costs and service fees. Management is cautious of cost overruns related to the development and expansion of live music venues.For second-quarter, our model estimates direct operating expenses to rise 4.2% year over year.

55,8f412f70-b04c-3ccd-947d-30077cce9878,MGM,2023-07-26,3 Top Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Gain as Inflation Eases,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-consumer-discretionary-stocks-120000140.html,1690286400,STORY,"['MGM', 'CUK']","[Recent reports on inflation suggest that the spike in the prices of indispensable goods and services over the past two years is finally coming down as fuel prices fall.This means consumers are now in a better position to open up their wallets, eventually benefiting consumer discretionary stocks such as Carnival Corporation &amp; plc CCL, MGM Resorts International MGM and LiveOne, Inc. LVO.Retail Inflation Cools DownAfter a painful increase in retail inflation, price pressures cooled down to its slowest pace in more than two years in June. The Bureau of Labor Statistics stated that the consumer price index (CPI) increased 3% year over year last month, less than analysts’ estimate of a rise of 3.1%.The yearly rate of inflation decelerated from May’s increase of 4%, and was also the lowest rate since March 2021. Notably, retail inflation slowed down for 12 successive months. The decline in the cost of airfare  and prices of used vehicles were primarily responsible for the slowdown in broader price pressures.Retail inflation more than halved after a sharp rise in energy prices pushed it to a 40-year high of 9.1% in 2022.Wholesale Price Data Indicates Easing Inflationary PressureLast month, the annual increase in producer prices was also the smallest in almost three years, indicating that the economy is now in a disinflation period. The Labor Department added that the producer price index (PPI) increased a meager 0.1% year over year, the smallest annual rise since August 2020.What’s more encouraging, in May, the headline PPI number, in reality, dropped by 0.4%, in contrast to the earlier reported 0.3%. Producer prices are declining as supply-chain bottlenecks fade, and demand for goods takes a beating due to a series of interest rate hikes.Fed’s Favored Inflation Index ModerateThe chosen inflation index of the Federal Reserve too cooled down in May. Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis, compared to the same period last year, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased by 3.8% in May, its lowest annual rate in two years, again an indication that inflation is slowing.Story continuesThe decline in energy prices dragged the PCE Index lower in May. Energy prices fell 13.4% in May from a year ago and were down 3.9% from the prior month.Consumer Discretionary Stocks to BenefitWith price pressures weakening, the purchasing power of consumers increases. In other words, consumers are now in a much better position to splurge on nonobligatory items. Therefore, it's prudent for investors to cash on this trend and bet on solid consumer discretionary stocks.We have, thus, selected three consumer discretionary stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Such stocks also boast a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Carnival operates as a cruise and vacation company. Carnival has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CCL’s current-year earnings has moved up 51.7% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 97% (read more: 2 Cruise Stocks Boosting the S&amp;P 500 Rally in 1H 2023).MGM Resorts International is a holding company and primarily owns and operates casino resorts through wholly owned subsidiaries. MGM Resorts has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MGM’s current-year earnings has moved up 2.7% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the next year is 19.6%.LiveOne provides a platform for live streaming and on-demand audio, video, and podcast/vodcast content in music, comedy, and pop culture. LiveOne has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LVO’s current-year earnings has moved up 200% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 154.6%.Shares of Carnival, MGM Resorts and LiveOne have gained 121.5%, 46.1% and 150.2%, respectively, so far this year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

57,f19effa8-bfb0-3d23-8c50-5f4ef476ed58,NCLH,2023-07-26,Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norwegian-cruise-line-nclh-earnings-140126825.html,1690293686,STORY,['NCLH'],"[The market expects Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis cruise operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +123.7%.Revenues are expected to be $2.18 billion, up 83.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.07% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Norwegian Cruise Line?For Norwegian Cruise Line, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +10.43%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Norwegian Cruise Line will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Norwegian Cruise Line would post a loss of $0.43 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.30, delivering a surprise of +30.23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Norwegian Cruise Line appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry, Live Nation (LYV), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.63 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -4.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $4.82 billion, up 8.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Live Nation has been revised 7.1% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 35.05%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Live Nation will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 44.4%.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 63 cents per share, down 4.6% year over year. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $4.82 billion, up 8.8% year over year.Factors to NoteLive Nation Entertainment’s top line is likely to have benefited from pent-up demand for live events, robust ticket sales, and sponsorship and advertising business. The company continues to gain from a rise in average per-fan spending and an increase in ticket pricing.In second-quarter 2023, our model predicts concerts as well as sponsorship and advertising revenues to increase 3.9% and 20.3% year over year to $3,737.7 million and $317.3 million, respectively. Also, we expect ticketing revenues to improve 4.8% year over year to $603.1 million.However, higher expenses due to increased labor-hiring costs, artist activation costs and other operational expenses are likely to have hurt LYV’s bottom line in the quarter to be reported. Also, it has been witnessing a rise in venue costs and service fees. Management is cautious of cost overruns related to the development and expansion of live music venues.For second-quarter, our model estimates direct operating expenses to rise 4.2% year over year. We project adjusted operating margin of 10.5% compared with 10.8% reported in the prior-year quarter.Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.

While a lump sum may seem attractive, MetLife’s 2023 Structured Settlements Poll, released today, found 81% of plaintiff attorneys are concerned that their clients will deplete their settlement award lump sums too quickly, despite 66% believing their clients are financially savvy.""Deciding whether to take a settlement award as a lump sum or a structured settlement is a critical decision that can have serious, long-term consequences and plaintiffs need to understand their options,"" says Bejan Shirvani, vice president and head of Structured Settlements at MetLife. ""Structured settlements are a tax efficient approach that provide guaranteed payments, ensuring that plaintiffs don’t deplete their award too quickly and protecting against market volatility.""Recommending Structured SettlementsNearly all employment plaintiff attorneys, 97%, are very or somewhat familiar with their clients’ ability to take their employment award as a structured settlement. And, 96% of these attorneys at least occasionally, if not always, recommend that their clients consider using a structured settlement instead of taking their settlement award as a lump sum.When it comes to who has the responsibility of recommending this approach to settlement awards, 86% of employee plaintiff attorneys believe they should be the one to recommend that their clients consider a structured settlement when the circumstances are appropriate. This includes nearly half, 42%, who strongly agree that they should make the recommendation.Story continuesHowever, this recommendation is not made in a vacuum. In addition to their advice, employment plaintiff attorneys always or sometimes encourage their clients to meet with tax attorneys (86%), financial advisors (86%), certified public accountants (80%), and structured settlement brokers (73%) to discuss their settlement award.The Benefits of Structured SettlementsThere are a number of considerations that drive employment plaintiff attorneys to recommend structured settlements to their clients. Included among the top reasons are: structured settlements provide guaranteed payments for either a certain time period or for life (57%), allow them to receive some immediate cash now while providing long-term steady payments for the future (55%), ensure that clients won’t deplete their award too quickly (51%), provide tax-efficient payments/reduce taxes (48%), and allow clients to receive periodic income thereby spreading their income tax obligations over time (46%).Structured settlements can provide a tax efficient means of receiving the settlement award by spreading income tax liability across future years. With a lump sum, the client’s tax obligation needs to be paid in full at the time the settlement is reached. In comparison, with a structured settlement, clients will pay taxes in the year payments are received.In addition to these advantages, 86% of attorneys agree that structured settlements can be a good negotiating tool for employment matters to speed up the resolution of a claim and/or make it more likely to settle, avoiding a lengthy trial along with the associated legal costs and potential emotional toll.The Role of BrokersA majority, 84%, of employment plaintiff attorneys believe structured settlement brokers play an important role in positioning the value of a structured settlement, including 31% who believe they play a very important role.""Brokers play a vital role in highlighting the value of structured settlements, not only providing education to attorneys, but also working with plaintiffs to help them understand how structured settlements work,"" says Shirvani. ""Brokers have an opportunity to further strengthen their relationships with attorneys by providing guidance on how to position structured settlements with clients, including best practices, case studies and real-world examples.""In fact, nearly two thirds of employment plaintiff attorneys (62%) have been approached by a structured settlement broker about structuring their clients’ settlement award. Among those in contact with brokers, nine in 10 (90%) receive a call or email from a structured settlement broker at least once a month, including 61% who hear from brokers 2-3 times per month.About the StudyThe MetLife 2023 Structured Settlements Poll was fielded between May 2 and May 15, 2023. MetLife commissioned MMR Research Associates, Inc. to conduct the online survey using an online panel of pre-identified attorneys. Survey responses were received from 250 employment plaintiff attorneys who specialize in employment litigation or who litigated an employment case in the previous 12 months.About MetLifeMetLife, Inc.

61,20bf3abe-770b-319a-a40d-c9827dcc2386,IT,2023-07-26,Earnings Preview: Gartner (IT) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-gartner-q2-earnings-140126190.html,1690293686,STORY,['IT'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Gartner (IT) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis technology information and analysis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13%.Revenues are expected to be $1.49 billion, up 8.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.32% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Gartner?For Gartner, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +5.86%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Gartner will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Gartner would post earnings of $2.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.88, delivering a surprise of +41.18%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Gartner doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Industry group American Petroleum Institute figures had indicated a 1.32 million-barrel build. [EIA/S] [API/S]Gasoline and diesel stocks also drew less than expected, EIA data showed.""The drawdowns weren't all that spectacular. It was a neutral to bearish report, plus the Federal Reserve rate hike can have a dampening hit on demand and prices,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.Oil prices have rallied for four weeks, buoyed by signs of tighter supplies, largely linked to output cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia, as well as Chinese authorities' pledges to shore up the world's second-biggest economy.Although the market expects Saudi Arabia to roll over its August output cuts to September, sources told Reuters on Wednesday that Russia is expected to significantly increase oil loadings in September, bringing to an end steep export cuts.Meanwhile, concern is high over whether China, also the world's second-biggest oil consumer, will deliver on its policy pledges.Story continues""We still need to wait for actual policies - the risk is that these policies fall short of expectations,"" said ING head commodities strategist Warren Patterson.""The market will continue to be in a tug-of-war between tightening global supply and fears of slowing demand due to the global economic slowdown,"" Hiroyuki Kikukawa, president of NS Trading, a unit of Nissan Securities, added.(Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar in Houston, Natalie Grover in London; Additional reporting by Yuka Obayashi and Trixie Yap; Editing by Marguerita Choy and David Evans)]"

On the contrary, participants continue to weigh the likelihood of a material downturn in the U.S. and Europe against expectations of a tightening market and large supply deficits through the end of the year.But the evidence of tight supply-demand balances that the market needed may finally be here.“Serious Problems With Supply Keeping Up”While demand has already returned to pre-pandemic levels and set for a record annual average this year, supply is having trouble keeping up, setting the stage for higher oil prices in the second half of this year, according to Joseph McMonigle, Secretary General of International Energy Forum (IEF), the world’s largest international organization of energy ministers.Demand is rising, and the market will see massive inventory draws beginning this quarter and lasting through next year, McMonigle told CNBC in an interview this weekend.“So, for the second half of this year, we’re going to have serious problems with supply keeping up, and as a result, you’re going to see prices respond to that,” McMonigle told CNBC on the sidelines of a G20 energy ministers meeting in India.China and India, the world’s largest and third-largest oil importers, respectively, will be the key drivers of rising oil demand, he added.Combined, India and China are expected to account for 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of demand increase in the second half of this year, according to McMonigle.Story continuesRelated: Saudi Arabia’s Oil Revenues Slump To The Lowest Level Since 2021“We’re going to see much more steep decreases in inventory, which will be a signal to the market that demand is definitely picking up. So you’re going to see prices respond to that,” he told CNBC.In case of demand exceeding expectations and tightening the market too much, OPEC+ producers could move to unwind some of the current cuts, the IEF secretary general noted.Demand RisingGlobal oil demand jumped by more than 3 million bpd in May compared to April, nearing the record demand level seen in March this year, the IEF said earlier this month, citing data by the Joint Organizations Data Initiative (JODI). China’s total oil product demand hit 17.37 million bpd in May, the JODI data showed. This was an increase of 1.7 million bpd compared to April and the second-highest level ever reported in JODI.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) also forecasts inventory drawdowns to start this quarter and continue until the fourth quarter of 2024, putting upward pressure on oil prices. Global oil inventories increased by an average of 600,000 bpd in the first half of 2023, but they will fall by an average of 700,000 bpd in the second half, the EIA said in its July Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO).Goldman Sachs expects oil prices to rise to $86 per barrel at year-end, as record-high oil demand and lowered supply will lead to a large market deficit.“We expect pretty sizable deficits in the second half with deficits of almost 2 million barrels per day in the third quarter as demand reaches an all-time high,” Daan Struyven, head of oil research at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC on Monday.Recession Odds DeclineGoldman’s analysts are also more optimistic that the U.S. could avoid a recession, fears of which have kept oil prices weighed down and below $80 per barrel in the second quarter of the year.Last week, Goldman Sachs cut its probability that a U.S. recession will start in the next 12 months further, from 25% to 20%, due to the fact that the recent economic data have reinforced the bank’s confidence that “bringing inflation down to an acceptable level will not require a recession,” wrote Jan Hatzius, head of Goldman Sachs Research and the firm’s chief economist.The Fed is largely expected to raise interest rates at the July 26 meeting, Goldman and many other analysts concur. But many believe this could be the end of the money-tightening cycle. The oil market will be closely watching the Fed decision—and most of all, the comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell accompanying the decision—for clues about the economy.“Crude prices are tentatively breaking out as expectations remain for the oil market to remain tight despite all global weakness that is emerging,” Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said on Monday as oil prices rallied to a three-month high and Brent topped $82 per barrel.If the U.S. succeeds in avoiding a recession and China increases economic stimulus to help a rebound in the second half of 2023, oil market participants will focus more on fundamentals, which have started to point to a supply deficit and higher prices later this year.

But signs of a draw in gasoline inventories showed that fuel demand remained steady, thanks largely to the travel-heavy summer season.Government data on inventories is due later on Wednesday.Global oil supplies are also set to tighten as the effects of production cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia begin to be felt.Fed rate hike, outlook awaitedThe Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points later in the day. But while the hike appears to be largely priced in by markets, uncertainty over the Fed’s outlook kept sentiment muted on Wednesday.Fed Fund future prices indicate that markets are pricing in the possibility that Wednesday’s hike will be the bank’s last for the year. But the Fed has given no such indication, and has forecast at least one more hike after today, given that inflation is still trending above the central bank’s annual target.Story continuesRising interest rates factored into fears that economic growth will slow this year, denting oil demand.

65,5c4efae5-b780-3067-9ace-fcf712a98567,O,2023-07-26,Gas prices: How profit margins may be costing drivers more,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/gas-prices-profit-margins-may-200723683.html,1690315643,VIDEO,"['BZ=F', 'CL=F']","[Profit margins from gasoline sales are keeping fuel prices elevated. Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman joins the Live show to explain how retailers' profit margins continue to cost drivers more.Video Transcript- Gas prices are ticking up slightly. The national average for regular fuel is up around $0.07 over the past month. But it's not just the price of oil that's kicking up costs. Yahoo Finance's Rick Newman has the story. Hey, Rick.RICK NEWMAN: Hey, guys. I came across some economic research recently into profit margins on gasoline sales. And I knew I had to look right into this because of all the conversations I've had with our audience members and drivers about why our gas prices so high? Who's making out when gas prices go up?So it turns out, if you think that retailers are charging more relative to the wholesale price, you're actually right about that. The profit margin on gasoline is about 77% higher than it was in 2019, and the profit margins have more than doubled for a couple periods in the post COVID era. So yes. Retailers are taking a bigger chunk of the price of gas as a profit margin.And before everybody goes howling about how much gas stations are ripping off drivers, keep in mind, we have pretty tight supplies of gasoline. We have a limit on refineries. There's basically a ceiling there. So we don't have-- supply is pretty tight, and that actually gives retailers pricing power. This is what some people have been calling greedflation. And it is kind of a thing.- Greedflation as in when companies set the prices artificially, right? Because of this expectation that prices are going up.RICK NEWMAN: Well, it's not artificial. It's the price. Let's remember, I mean, in capitalism, producers at the wholesale level, and retailers selling to consumers, everybody wants to sell their product for the highest price they can get. Usually, competition, it helps bring prices down because sellers compete with each other. But when you've got strong demand, which we have, because Americans have been buying stuff like crazy, and now they're out and about and traveling and buying gasoline. And when you have tight supply, those are the two factors that actually give sellers pricing power. So that's why they're able to charge these prices.Story continues- Really quickly, Rick, this is a question that always comes up when we talk about gas prices. To what extent is that price dictated by those individual gas stations? How much of it is the oil company's oil price.RICK NEWMAN: So despite rising profit margins, the cost of oil is still the biggest factor in gasoline. And rather than thinking that it is the sellers that are dictating the price, I think the biggest factor there is the lack of refining capacity. I mean, we have actually lost refining capacity in the United States, and we'll probably never have a new petroleum refinery built in the United States. So that's a bottleneck. Even when oil prices are low, we have a bottleneck on refining, and I think that constricts supply, and that gives retailers pricing power.- Rick Newman, thanks so much for breaking this down for us. Really appreciate it.RICK NEWMAN: Bye, guys.]"

However, gas prices are much lower today than they were last summer, when they spiked above $5 a gallon.“All of a sudden, things have popped up after a long period of low prices,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.Gasoline prices have risen in tandem with crude oil and other commodities. - David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesAs recently as July 4, gas prices had experienced a nearly unprecedented year-over-year decline.The unwelcome shift higher in pump prices follows a jump in oil prices, which have climbed to three-month highs as part of a broader rally in commodities. Wheat and corn prices have rallied after Russian attacks on port infrastructure in Ukraine.The timing is tricky.Cooling inflation, driven in part by easing gas prices, has raised hopes that the United States can avoid a recession. Investors are betting the Federal Reserve will soon be able to wrap up its inflation fight. And consumers have been feeling better, with consumer confidence hitting a two-year high in July.A return of higher food and fuel prices could unravel those positive trends.To be sure, gas prices are still down by 72 cents a gallon from a year ago. And the national average remains far from the record high of $5.02 a gallon last June.Still, gas prices have increased by 8 cents over the past week.Lipow blamed two powerful forces: OPEC and Russia cutting production, and extreme heat.Since last fall, Saudi Arabia-led OPEC and Russia have announced plans to slash output by almost 5 million barrels per day through July, according to Lipow.Although OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, likely have not cut that full amount of output, whatever cuts they have implemented are starting to be felt in the market.US oil prices jumped 2.2% on Monday to close at $78.74 a barrel — the highest close since April 24. In the span of just six weeks, oil has climbed 17%.Story continuesExtreme heat in the United States, Europe and elsewhere has also snarled some refinery operations, somewhat limiting the production of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.Some refineries that want to run all-out to take advantage of high profit margins may not be able to.“Refineries, like humans, do not like it when the heat index is 115,” Lipow said.High heat in the Middle East is forcing Saudi Arabia and other countries to burn oil to power their electrical grids.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com]"
69,4b6bccfb-d51f-39c8-9561-cbb414ee0d7f,MS,2023-07-26,"Fed set to propose new banking capital requirements, 'Basel III endgame'",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/fed-set-propose-banking-capital-152719274.html,1690298839,VIDEO,"['GS', 'WFC', 'JPM', 'BAC', 'C', 'MS']","[Fed officials are set to unveil an overhaul of banking capital requirements, known as the ""Basel III endgame,"" this week. American Banker Staff Writer Kyle Campbell sits down with Yahoo Finance Live to explain the ways in which these guidelines will mitigate risk differently for various forms of credit lending. Campbell describes how these new guidelines will impact certain larger, institutional banks, while examining the exposure regional banks may have to commercial real estate.Video Transcript- All right. On Thursday, just one day after the FOMC's latest interest rate decision, Federal Reserve will unveil a proposal for new bank capital requirements. The proposed rule would also lower the threshold for qualifying banks, meaning smaller institutions will face a new host of demands previously avoided.Fed vice chair for supervision, Michael Barr, outlined a sweeping plan to overhaul bank oversight requirements earlier this month. The proposal, set to come out Thursday, will offer more specifics on just how significant those changes could be.Joining us now with the latest is Kyle Campbell, staff writer at American Banker. Kyle, good to see you here. I talked to Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, about this. He really took a-- I would say, a hard line view of this. This could really be impactful to the economy. What have you been hearing from sources?KYLE CAMPBELL: Yeah, I mean, that's the big concern, right. Banks have been looking forward to this proposal for a long time now. Since 2017 is when the Basel III, they call it endgame, was first finalized, sort of, internationally, and now we're implementing that.Where this is-- what we're going to see on Thursday is just how that's going to impact the economy because we're going to find out which particular activities are going to be given which sort of risk weights under the new framework. So if, let's say, auto lending comes with a much heavier capital penalty, than a lot of banks are sort of forecasting with their internal models currently. It's going to make that type of financing more expensive, essentially.Story continuesAnd there is a view that as capital overall increases, it's just going to have a broader, sort of, tightening impact on the availability of credit broadly in the economy.- Is it really? Or is it just that their margins are going to get smaller? Or both, right?KYLE CAMPBELL: I think it's probably a bit of both but that's a great question. And certainly, consumer advocates are saying, well, look, the way that capital is raised is it's just hurting the bottom line for executives. You just have to retained earnings and you lose that sort of ROE, return on equity, that is what sort of fuels bank profits.So it's certainly going to result in less profitability, at least for some period of time. And again, how that actually impacts the availability of credit to the average person is going to really, I think-- I don't think it's particularly useful to try to forecast the overall picture, but you can get a good sense of how individual banks are going to be impacted by this once we see the specifics on Thursday.- For those banks, let's say a Wells Fargo, that have been struggling for some time, what does this mean for the struggling banks like a Wells Fargo?KYLE CAMPBELL: Wells Fargo, it'll be interesting. I mean, obviously if-- I mean, they've started to sort of move away from mortgages, which is one area where there's going to be a lot of focus. What happens to mortgages. You know, how does it get treated under the capital rules.I mean-- I think that where it's going to be more impactful than at Wells Fargo-- I mean, certainly they're going to be hit to some degree. But I think it's really going to be most impactful on the sort of mid-size banks, if you will. The ones that were in that sort of 100 billion to 250 billion asset range, that are now going to be facing these capital-- these sort of risk capital requirements for the first time.I think the large banks sort of know how to deal with these sort of requirements. And I don't think that a Wells Fargo is going to be as impacted, on a relative basis, as some of the smaller banks.- Let's turn to another issue that the market's been paying a lot of attention to, and that's commercial real estate and the risks associated with commercial real estate. In these earnings reports that we've gotten from banks, several of them announced steps to anticipate losses. To put aside money for losses, potential losses in commercial real estate.Wells Fargo, for example, boosted its allowance for credit losses. So where are we in that sort of situation?KYLE CAMPBELL: Yeah, that's a great question. And certainly, regulators are very focused on commercial real estate, giving some strong warnings to banks to do things like set aside losses and sort of avoid getting new exposures where you can avoid it.And that actually kind of compounds the issue because a lot of these-- I mean, certainly with offices, we know, the ones that are vacant, not getting people in, and that's sort of a whole issue unto itself. But there are some assets where they're kind of performing relatively well but they're going to need some kind of a recapitalization in order to remain viable and not end up as a foreclosure. And in order to do that, you need banks to sort come to the table.So I think what we're going to be looking for is who's going to move first. Are we going to see some of these sort of big capital equity investors, private equity funds, start to come in and say, hey, we're going to move in in a higher equity basis? Or are we going to see some banks say, hey, actually, we're going to be willing to back some of these recap-type strategies through lending?- Is this a potentially destabilizing event for the banking sector?KYLE CAMPBELL: I wouldn't think so.- I'm trying to compare it to what happened earlier this year.KYLE CAMPBELL: Right. Yeah. I mean, I think you're going to see some serious stress. And I wouldn't be surprised if at specific banks, you see some possible failures. I mean, you don't want to throw that term around too lightly. But yeah, it's possible that some banks could either have to be sold or go through some sort of an M&amp;A activity to sort of right the ship here.I wouldn't expect it to get to a level where we're needing to see serious intervention by the government because they're sort of very well aware of what's going on in real time. But these things can snowball pretty quickly. So yeah, it could be something to watch for sure.- Yeah, most definitely. Kyle, thanks for coming in. Good to see you.

70,31d64306-d2f7-37d0-99cc-67176a8a6110,MS,2023-07-26,Morgan Stanley (MS) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-ms-trending-stock-130006193.html,1690290006,STORY,['MS'],"[Morgan Stanley (MS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned +13.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Morgan Stanley falls in, has gained 15.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.44 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.85 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -8%. This estimate has changed -10.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.16 indicates a change of +22.3% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Morgan Stanley is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.42 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $54.84 billion and $58.47 billion estimates indicate +2.2% and +6.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $13.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.5%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.46%. The EPS surprise was +8.77%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Morgan Stanley is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. CWCO, California Water Service Group CWT, Entergy Corp. ETR and FirstEnergy Corp. FE.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Low-Beta Utility Stocks to Buy Ahead of Fed's Likely Rate HikeMarkets have been upbeat over the past couple of weeks as June inflation data raised hopes that the Fed might soon end its monetary tightening cycle. However, the Fed has already said that two more rate hikes would be required this year as inflation is still elevated.Market participants are now bracing for a 25-basis point interest rate hike in Fed’s July FOMC scheduled later this week. This has raised concerns once again, with stocks scrambling for direction.Concerns ResurfaceThe Fed left interest rates unchanged in June but said that inflation is still elevated and a lot higher than its target range of 2%. This is primarily because the economy is still holding up owing to a resilient labor market.The Fed has hiked interest rates by 500 basis points since March 2022, and the move appears to be finally working, with June consumer price inflation and producer price inflation both showing a considerable decline from the earlier multi-decade highs.The consumer price index (CPI) rose 3% in June on a year-over-year basis after rising 4% in May, its slowest level since March 2021. Month over month, CPI rose 0.2%. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also rose 0.2%.Year over year, core CPI rose 4.8% in June after hitting a 40-year-high of 9.1% in 2022. The producer price index increased 0.2% in June.However, the central bank hinted at two more interest rate hikes of 25 basis points each by the end of this year. Investors expect the first of these interest rate hikes to come into effect this week.Story continuesSlowing inflation has raised optimism among several market participants that the Fed may end its interest rate hike cycle. Yet, they are awaiting a clearer picture as the central bank officials have been hawkish in their stance.The Fed has said that the decision on when to stop hiking interest rates depends on economic data as and when it comes.An increase in interest rates can impact consumer spending behavior, increase borrowing expenses and lead to a slowdown in economic growth. These factors can have a negative effect on the performance of the stock market.Given the present situation, investing in utility stocks could be a wise decision. The utilities sector is known for its stability and maturity, as demand for essential services it provides tends to remain resilient during fluctuations in the economic cycle. These companies offer critical services like telecommunications, energy, gas and water, which are consistently in demand.Also, most utilities belong to the category of low-beta stocks (beta greater than 0 but less than 1). The recommended approach is to invest in low-beta equities with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank.Our ChoicesWe have narrowed our search to four low-beta utility stocks that are regular dividend payers. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

73,1ffa47dd-2dec-36d5-9826-33edf41f0142,FE,2023-07-26,Analysts Estimate FirstEnergy (FE) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-firstenergy-fe-report-140116893.html,1690293676,STORY,"['FE', 'CNP']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when FirstEnergy (FE) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis utility company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.46 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.2%.Revenues are expected to be $3 billion, up 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.87% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for FirstEnergy?For FirstEnergy, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.94%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that FirstEnergy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that FirstEnergy would post earnings of $0.61 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.60, delivering a surprise of -1.64%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.FirstEnergy doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, CenterPoint Energy (CNP) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.29 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -6.5%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.94 billion, down 0.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for CenterPoint has been revised 3.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.40%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CenterPoint will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

74,9af7bb10-c22a-3969-85ce-d8dd4e706854,FE,2023-07-26,4 Low-Beta Utility Stocks to Buy Ahead of Fed's Likely Rate Hike,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-low-beta-utility-stocks-122000803.html,1690287600,STORY,"['ETR', 'FE', 'CWT', 'CWCO']","[Markets have been upbeat over the past couple of weeks as June inflation data raised hopes that the Fed might soon end its monetary tightening cycle. However, the Fed has already said that two more rate hikes would be required this year as inflation is still elevated.Market participants are now bracing for a 25-basis point interest rate hike in Fed’s July FOMC scheduled later this week. This has raised concerns once again, with stocks scrambling for direction.Concerns ResurfaceThe Fed left interest rates unchanged in June but said that inflation is still elevated and a lot higher than its target range of 2%. This is primarily because the economy is still holding up owing to a resilient labor market.The Fed has hiked interest rates by 500 basis points since March 2022, and the move appears to be finally working, with June consumer price inflation and producer price inflation both showing a considerable decline from the earlier multi-decade highs.The consumer price index (CPI) rose 3% in June on a year-over-year basis after rising 4% in May, its slowest level since March 2021. Month over month, CPI rose 0.2%. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also rose 0.2%.Year over year, core CPI rose 4.8% in June after hitting a 40-year-high of 9.1% in 2022. The producer price index increased 0.2% in June.However, the central bank hinted at two more interest rate hikes of 25 basis points each by the end of this year. Investors expect the first of these interest rate hikes to come into effect this week.Slowing inflation has raised optimism among several market participants that the Fed may end its interest rate hike cycle. Yet, they are awaiting a clearer picture as the central bank officials have been hawkish in their stance.The Fed has said that the decision on when to stop hiking interest rates depends on economic data as and when it comes.An increase in interest rates can impact consumer spending behavior, increase borrowing expenses and lead to a slowdown in economic growth. These factors can have a negative effect on the performance of the stock market.Story continuesGiven the present situation, investing in utility stocks could be a wise decision. The utilities sector is known for its stability and maturity, as demand for essential services it provides tends to remain resilient during fluctuations in the economic cycle. These companies offer critical services like telecommunications, energy, gas and water, which are consistently in demand.Also, most utilities belong to the category of low-beta stocks (beta greater than 0 but less than 1). The recommended approach is to invest in low-beta equities with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank.Our ChoicesWe have narrowed our search to four low-beta utility stocks that are regular dividend payers. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

75,56513390-8825-3c60-b3ee-d68232242cb7,CRM,2023-07-26,Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-crm-trending-stock-130013289.html,1690290013,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +8.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.9% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has gained 3.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.90 per share, indicating a change of +59.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.44 points to a change of +42% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.99 indicates a change of +20.9% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $8.52 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.4%. The $34.63 billion and $38.47 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.5% and +11.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.3%. EPS of $1.69 for the same period compares with $0.98 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.17 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.95%. The EPS surprise was +4.97%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Shivani KakThank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. This morning, Moody's released its results for the second quarter of 2023 as well as our revised outlook for select metrics for full year 2023. The earnings press release and the presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com. During this call, we will also be presenting non-GAAP or adjusted figures. Please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings press release filed this morning for a reconciliation between all adjusted measures referenced during this call in U.S. GAAP. I call your attention to the safe harbor language which can be found toward the end of our earnings release. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In accordance with the act, I also direct your attention to the Management's Discussion and Analysis section and the risk factors discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and in other SEC filings made by the company, which are available on our website and on the SEC's website.

Rob Fauber, Moody's President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our results, key business highlights and outlook. After which, he'll be joined by Mark Kaye, Moody's Chief Financial Officer, to answer your questions. I'll now turn the call over to Rob.Story continuesRobert Scott FauberThanks, Shivani. Good afternoon, and thanks to everybody for joining today's call. As we typically do, I'm going to touch on a few key takeaways from our second quarter results and provide some insights into what's supporting our growth outlook. I also want to continue to highlight some of the exciting growth opportunities within the Decision Solutions line of business. And this quarter, I'm going to spotlight our insurance business. Then I'm going to talk about how we are positioning ourselves for what I tend to think of as a generational opportunity provided by generative AI. And as always, Mark and I will be happy to take your questions. We delivered strong performance across the firm this quarter. MIS achieved its first quarter of revenue growth in 6 quarters amidst a steady improvement in issuance. In fact, revenue growth -- revenue grew 6%, outpacing a 3% increase in issuance. And the improvement in the issuance environment was led by a 54% increase in investment-grade activity. And this, combined with the ongoing gradual recovery in high-yield bonds, has led us to raise MIS' revenue guidance for the full year to high single-digit growth, up from our prior guidance of low to mid-single-digit growth. We continue to sustain 10% ARR growth in MA and selling into strong demand for our suite of mission-critical data analytics and workflow tools. And this quarter, we're introducing some additional top line disclosures for our banking, insurance and KYC businesses so that we can provide you with more insight into the robust performance of Decision Solutions. The stronger-than-expected revenue growth in MIS is driving the increase in our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $9.75 to $10.25. And we continue to balance our expense control measures while furthering our investment in the business. We're capitalizing on our unique ability to integrate proprietary data sets and advanced capabilities from across our businesses into tailored cloud-based solutions. And we're innovating and investing extensively across the company to build further on this momentum with several key initiatives focused around generative AI technology, turbocharged by our recent partnership with Microsoft. And over the past several months, as our businesses continue to scale, we spent considerable time talking with investors about how to think about the Moody's of today. And I want to share that with you because I think it's really useful context for understanding both our performance and our growth opportunity. And we've got several great crown jewel businesses. And anchoring those businesses, of course, is MIS, the global agency of choice for issuers and investors. But in MA, we have one of the world's premier subscription-based fixed income and economics research businesses; a data business powered by what we believe is the world's largest database on companies and credit; and 3 cloud-based SaaS businesses serving banking, insurance and KYC workflows. At a high level, these businesses come together to help banks, insurers, corporates and public sector entities really do 1 of 3 things: First, to help them commence a relationship or an exposure, so to issue, originate, select or underwrite; second, during the life of that relationship, help them measure, monitor and manage risk; and third, on the back end, help them verify, account, comply, plan and report. And to do this, we leverage a tremendous set of proprietary data analytics and domain expertise across a range of areas: Credit, companies, properties, securities, people, economies, ESG, climate and more. And we think of that as our risk operating system, and we thread that content through our solutions, and that's what makes our customer value proposition both sticky and differentiated. So with that backdrop, let me touch on MIS for the quarter. So the headwinds of the first quarter have largely dissipated, and that has led to more constructive market conditions and a surge in investment-grade issuance. In fact, May was one of the busiest months on record for investment-grade activity as both corporate and infrastructure issuers came to the market opportunistically. And I've said previously that investment-grade activity opens the door for issuance further down the rating scale, and that's exactly what we've seen with the ongoing recovery in high-yield bonds. And we saw the strongest issuance quarter since the beginning of 2022 in high yield, and that drove an almost 50% increase in our high-yield revenue versus the prior year period. And so primarily based on the stronger-than-expected performance in both investment-grade and high yield, we're raising our issuance and revenue guidance for MIS for the full year. And so the backdrop to the market recovery, I would say, still remains fragile. And of our first-time mandates signed in the second quarter, only 25% or so have issued, as some of those corporate treasurers and CFOs wait on the sidelines for more market certainty around the path of inflation and rates and the economy. And so muted M&amp;A activity is also contributing to a limited supply of leveraged loans, and that has negatively impacted CLO creation since over 60% of these loans typically go on to be securitized. Within other structured finance asset classes, such as CMBS and RMBS, higher all-in funding costs are restricting asset creation, and that's resulting in fewer deals and leading us to take down our structured finance issuance forecast for the year. And while we've had softer issuance markets over the past year, we've been strengthening our position in the markets of the future to reinforce MIS' position as the agency of choice. We have strategically invested in our emerging markets footprint for many years, and you've heard us talk about this at investor days and on earnings calls. And that's because, although emerging markets account for something like 50% of global GDP, they represent less than 10% of cross-border issuance. So we recognize this opportunity for long-term growth. And our investment includes thought leadership like our Annual Emerging Markets Summit that we held in the second quarter. We attracted participants from over 90 countries to that conference. And in the second quarter, we also closed on our acquisition of SCRiesgo, a domestic credit rating agency serving Central America, further strengthening our growing Moody's local franchise all across Latin America. And as the digitization of financial markets accelerates, we're positioning MIS as a leader in assessing decentralized finance, digital bonds and asset tokenization. We've rated a number of firsts in this space, and that includes just this month, the European Investment Bank's first-ever digital green bond. And of course, we continue to grow our sustainable finance franchise within MIS with good momentum in second-party opinions. You may recall, we relaunched our methodology in the fourth quarter of 2022. We have now completed over 90 second-party opinions through the first half of this year, and that includes for marquee issuers like Enel and the government of Mexico. And we have delivered 36% growth in the SPO volumes versus the same prior year period. Now moving to MA. Just a few minutes ago, I described Decision Solutions as primarily 3 cloud-based SaaS businesses serving banking, insurance and KYC workflows. And as these businesses scale, we want to offer some additional insights into their performance. So from this quarter onwards, we're going to be providing revenue and ARR metrics for each of them. And as you can see here, each of these businesses achieved double-digit revenue growth in the second quarter. And together, they delivered 10% ARR growth with KYC leading the way at nearly 20% ARR growth. So last quarter, we provided a spotlight on our banking business within Decision Solutions. And I thought this quarter that I would touch on our insurance business. We got some good feedback from that spotlight last quarter. And our insurance business brings together the legacy MA insurance business, which mainly serves life insurers; with RMS, which caters primarily the P&amp;C market. And collectively, our insurance business delivers workflow solutions for underwriting, risk and capital management and financial and regulatory reporting, and it generates in the neighborhood of $500 million of ARR. So it makes it a very significant component of the broader MA portfolio. And like banks, insurers are undergoing a significant period of transformation as they work to digitize and automate manual and fragmented workflows in order to be both more effective and more efficient in underwriting, in risk management and capital planning. And this opens new opportunities for us to establish and expand our presence, offering new solutions and capabilities much in the same way that we have successfully done with banks. And at the heart of our insurance offerings are our AXIS and RMS risk engines. And AXIS provides the core actuarial and finance cash flow modeling that is widely used by life insurers, reinsurers and consulting firms for functions that include pricing, reserving, asset liability management, financial modeling, capital calculations and hedging. And AXIS has proven to be a significant catalyst for growth and this quarter was no exception. This quarter, growth was fueled by increasing demand for our fully automated service, which enables insurers to send their actuarial modeling jobs to a cloud-based infrastructure for very efficient processing. And also contributing to growth in the second quarter is our risk integrity offering which seamlessly integrates with AXIS and provides a highly automated solution for calculating financial statement information in compliance with IFRS 17 regulations. Now on the property and casualty side, in May, we held our most successful global insurance conference ever called Exceedance. I was there with about 500 of our customers from around the world. And we made several very important new product announcements. And I have to say, I left the conference feeling very optimistic about the opportunities in front of us to serve the insurance industry. So first, our cloud-based, what we call Intelligent Risk Platform, or IRP. That is industrial-strength and it is differentiated in the market. We now have well north of 100 customers on the Intelligent Risk Platform in the cloud. And this allows customers to run our new more granular, what we call, high-definition models by leveraging cloud computing power on demand. And that gives our customers a competitive advantage for those of our customers who are using this cloud solution. We also announced that we're partnering with NASDAQ, enabling our customers to seamlessly access a wide array of cat models available on the NASDAQ platform in addition to our customers' own internal models. And this collaboration significantly enhances the value and capabilities of our IRP as a broader industry workflow platform. So with this very compelling set of capabilities and solutions across insurance, now let me talk a little bit about the customer expansion opportunity. And we have over 900 insurance customers globally, and there is a significant opportunity for cross-selling and growing revenue per customer. We have very substantial relationships with our top 10 largest insurance customers who purchase on average about 6 to 7 product families from across all of MA. Our next 90 largest insurers purchase, on average, about 4 to 5 product families. And our remaining 800 customers buy an average of just 1 to 2 products. So you can really see the extent of the cross-sell opportunity. And let me give you an example of how we are growing our insurance relationships. So 5 years ago, one of the larger U.S. insurers was spending about $15 million annually with us across products spanning risk and capital management, finance and reporting workflow tools; and also some other products, including our MIS data feeds for risk management functions like risk-adjusted capital calculations and portfolio construction. After the acquisition of RMS, this customer relationship grew substantially to north of $25 million. And this insurer is now a significant customer of both AXIS and RMS. And given the breadth of business activities of a large insurer, and that includes lending and investing in addition to underwriting, they also subscribed to a number of our other solutions, like our CreditLens loan origination, our CreditView research platform and our structured finance and commercial real estate data and analytics, and even our KYC tools. And that has altogether allowed us to expand the relationship to an ARR of over $30 million. And KYC offers another compelling cross-sell opportunity with insurers as well as corporates. And in fact, in 2021, less than 10% of our insurance customers subscribed to a KYC product. Just 2 years later, we're up to about 20% and we are optimistic about further potential here. So our ability to deliver unique and innovative solutions is also being recognized across the industry. And of the awards that are listed on this slide, I have to say I'm particularly proud of our recent recognition as the overall winner of Chartis' inaugural Insurance 25 Award because it highlights our innovative market-leading solutions that span climate, cat risk modeling and economic and financial analysis. And speaking of innovation. As you hopefully heard during our recent Gen AI briefing, artificial intelligence is fundamental to many of our products, and frankly, it has been for years. I want to touch on 3 of those. And I'd start with QUIQspread, which is an AI machine learning tool that we have developed in-house that digitizes and spreads financial data. And it's been integrated into a number of our products, including our CreditLens loan origination offering. And today, it's used by hundreds of customers, including banks around the world. Our AI Review product is really at the heart of our KYC screening solutions. It's been trained on over 12 million actual KYC analyst decisions and it's currently used by over 500 customers. And so far this year, it's processed over 110 million names. And this all helps further train the artificial intelligence engine that powers these insights, and it reduces the likelihood of false positives by up to 80%. And that eliminates countless hours of manual work and reduces the time to screen for our customers from hours to literally just seconds. So a huge value prop for our customers. And finally, NewsEdge, where we've been leveraging deep learning combined with natural language processing to enhance and optimize our data retrieval, enrichment and sentiment generation over our multi-domain data sets, employing state of the art big data techniques. And to give you a sense of what this means in practical terms, our models are consuming, categorizing and scoring nearly 1 million new stories from over 20,000 sources each and every day. So these are just 3 of our over -- I'd say over a dozen AI-enabled products, which bring a global team of engineers and product specialists with distinct and deep skill sets around natural language processing and artificial intelligence. And our historical foundational AI experience uniquely positions us, I think, to capitalize on the immense opportunities presented by generative AI. And Gen AI is going to revolutionize how individuals and companies derive insights, how they participate in financial markets and how they navigate an increasingly complex world. And that's why we partnered with Microsoft. Combining Moody's vast proprietary data, analytics and research with Microsoft's industry-leading Gen AI technology and Azure OpenAI service, that's going to allow us to create new offerings that provide deeper, richer insights into risk than ever before. And by applying machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks to large collections of data and insights, individuals and organizations will be able to drive greater efficiency, accuracy, insight and innovation in financial processes. And earlier today, we published a, I'd call it, teaser demo of one of our first Gen AI innovations. And we're calling it the Moody's Research Assistant. It's an interactive chat feature that looks across Moody's vast data sets and research to provide customers with multifaceted and integrated perspectives of risks that few others can provide. And the assistant will have the ability to access data and content across multiple domains, such as firmographic data, credit indicators, economic forecast and risk and reputational profiles, and deliver results to users based on their own personalized needs. So we're beginning to preview this innovation with customers to demonstrate the really, I think, extraordinary value that it's going to bring, powered by Microsoft's technology and anchored by Moody's proprietary data. So be sure to check it out on our IR website. And importantly, I do want to acknowledge that Moody's Gen AI is a journey of human enablement. And we have deployed this technology to all of our 14,000-plus employees, I call them our 14,000 innovators, so that we can innovate at scale and pilot new ways to enrich our jobs with powerful new insights and improved productivity, all at our fingertips. And before I close, I'd like to give a big shout out to our employees. During the month of June, over 3,000 Moody's teammates, and I was with them, took part in 150-plus volunteer projects across 32 countries. And their efforts delivered over 8,600 volunteer hours dedicated to making a difference in our communities. So our people are living our values, and it's great stuff. That concludes my prepared remarks. Mark and I would be very happy to take your questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer.Owen LauSo it looks like MA has more investments into product development such as AI Rob talked about, but it dragged down the operating margin in the second quarter and also full year guidance. So I think it will be great if you can maybe give us an update on the seasonality of your P&amp;L by segment and how we should think about that.Mark Bradley KayeSure, George. Thanks for the question. So last quarter, we anticipated that near-term capital markets and activity would be constrained before progressively improving in the second half. And while issuance was indeed lower in certain asset classes than expected, for example structured, we did observe, and you heard this from Rob, higher-than-anticipated investment-grade volumes, given strong investor demand for our high-quality credits. So taking that into account and along with our expectation for relatively stable-ish market conditions for the remainder of the year, we are lifting our full year 2023 global MIS-rated issuance to the mid-single-digit percent range and our MIS revenue growth to the high single-digit percent range. And this, together with our better-than-expected year-to-date MIS revenue result, now implies MIS revenue growth in the range of low to mid-20s percent on average for the remainder of the year versus the relatively low year-to-date 2022 comparable period. That's really given the market disruption that we had in the prior year from geopolitical concerns and a deterioration of some macroeconomic conditions. This also means that we anticipate our MIS 2023 year-to-go revenue in absolute dollars to be comparable to the pre-pandemic levels we observed in the second half of 2019. And on the MA side, our reaffirmed guidance for the full year 2023 MA revenue to grow approximately 10%, together with our mid-90s percent retention rates, then implies the second half revenue will be in the low double-digit percent range. And that's going to reflect the strong ongoing demand for our subscription-based products and solutions, really as customers continue to look to Moody's to deliver the tools they need to incorporate risk resiliency, evaluate exponential risk, et cetera, in their workflows and processes. And that means that we forecast, in the third quarter, MA adjusted operating margin to step up to this -- compared to the second quarter and then sequentially improve again in the fourth quarter, very much in line with revenue, and really, as MA fully realizes the benefits of our restructuring program and additional cost saving initiatives. And then finally, our outlook for the full year 2023, total Moody's operating expense growth remains within that mid-single-digit percent range, albeit at the higher end. And this balances our expectation for higher incentive and stock-based compensation costs with the improvement in our issuance outlook and the introduction of new initiatives to accelerate the development and deployment of some of our AI solutions. And if I was going to translate that full year 2023 operating expense guidance, that really means along the lines of a low single-digit percent decline in MIS and the higher end of high single-digit percent growth in MA. And Owen, I apologize. That answer was for you, not for George.Owen LauNo problem. Very helpful, Mark.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.Keen Fai TongSo 2Q debt issuance and ratings revenue performance was strong and led you to raise your full year guidance for MIS. That said, the issuance in July so far has been relatively weak. How much of a pull-forward in debt issuance into 2Q do you believe happened? And does your guidance reflect simply a flow-through of 2Q outperformance, or does it assume a stronger 3Q and 4Q than you previously expected?Robert Scott FauberGeorge, it's Rob. This is probably a question in the minds of many thinking about first half, second half and then triangulating to our full year guide. So we certainly saw a stronger investment-grade issuance in the first half than we expected. And yes, we do think that was likely due in part to some pull-forward in advance of the debt ceiling. There's just also some investor preference for really the higher end of the rating spectrum. The stress in the U.S. banking sector, I'd say, probably dissipated a little bit faster than we had expected and kind of a return of market confidence. So as we're kind of looking at the -- going into the second half of the year, when we look at leveraged finance, and I'm talking about high yield and leveraged loans, our general thinking is that the current run rate that we're seeing for high-yield and leveraged loans, I'd say the sequential run rate, if you will, that looks sustainable. And because we've got easier comps in the second half of the year, that implies some higher percent growth rates for leveraged finance in particular, and also we expect, will contribute to a positive revenue mix. And to put maybe a little bit finer point on it. Our issuance outlook implies a low 20s percent increase in issuance for the second half of 2023. And that, combined with what we saw in the first half, gets us to this mid-single digit for the year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.Manav Shiv PatnaikIf I could just ask around all these Gen AI initiatives and stuff you've highlighted so far. Like is that all incremental expenses? Or how are you thinking about in terms of spend and budget versus what, I guess, you were already doing before?Mark Bradley KayeManav, so we expect to realize meaningful productivity gains and efficiency as we progressively incorporate Gen AI into our Moody's ecosystem, from technology and software development organizations, to our customer support, shared service, even research teams. I think we would say it's too early to provide estimates around the extent of these efficiencies, but initial pilots are promising. So for example, the deployment of our coding assistant to some of our software development teams has shown material productivity benefits through both error reduction and coding time acceleration. Another clear benefit is the opportunity that the technology brings to our rating analysts, where the use cases are vast. For example, you could think about using Gen AI to transform in part our analytical workflow. For example, analysts can shift their focus towards forming more valuable opinions, augmenting their capabilities, for example, through faster data processing, advanced data interpretation, spreading, et cetera. And the point here is that, in total if we step back for a minute, you can think about Gen AI as really just reinforcing and increasing our confidence in achieving our annual and our medium-term expense and margin targets.Robert Scott FauberManav, it's Rob. I'd also say, and I think you were asking specifically also about just the extent of investment. Is it incremental? Is it significant investment? I would say that we're able to leverage a lot of the investment that we already have. You think about we have -- most of our solutions are on the cloud. It's one reason I highlight it on the call. We've got a lot of expertise already across the firm around AI. I think one of the costs, and it's too early for us to know what this looks like, we don't yet know exactly the pricing structure of our products. But there's going to be incremental compute cost. And running these models is not cheap. So it's still a little early for us because we're just now, Manav, going into preview mode with customers, getting feedback from customers, thinking about than what the product pricing and packaging looks like and then what the costs out will look like. So I think, Manav, we're going to have a much better sense for this in another quarter or so.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.Kevin Damien McVeighJust to follow up on the generative AI a little bit. Is there any way to think about kind of where you are in the process in MA versus MIS? And if there's a way -- one thing that gives me a lot of optimism is the potential efficiencies from a delivery perspective, given how regulated the industry is, keeps a lot of your footprint onshore. Is there any way to think about what the potential longer-term impact is from a margin perspective as maybe you leverage the AI across both MA and MIS in terms of not necessarily next quarter, but how we should think about that a little bit longer term as some of these efficiencies are brought to bear?Robert Scott FauberYes. Kevin, it's Rob. And look, I would be remiss if I don't talk about both sides of the equation here because -- and I promise you, I will touch on the efficiency opportunity. But this really is, we think, a compelling opportunity for us in terms of how we deliver our content. And so we are very much approaching this in terms of opportunity first and what is the opportunity to deliver unique value to our customers. And as you heard me say to Manav, we're early days here. If you want to get a sense of what it looks like, I hope you get a chance to check out the video. That is a very easy way to understand how we're thinking about deploying this and what the opportunity will be. I would also say that we have approached this from a One Moody's perspective. And that is really, really important because this was an opportunity for us to set up a firm-wide infrastructure, a copilot across the firm. We obviously have to think about entitlements and controls and other things and risk management, all those things. But there's an opportunity to use one infrastructure across the firm. And as we have innovations across the firm, people able to deploy those innovations into our firm-wide ecosystem. Now you mentioned MIS specifically. The MIS teams are very engaged around this and very engaged with our AI enablement team we put together, and looking at ways that they are going to be able to process more information, to get new insights to be able to get through these things more quickly. And I really think about it, Kevin, as essentially turbocharging our people. And we have always heard from our issuers that we have the most experienced analysts, and they really value that. And now I think about, all right, now we have the most experienced analysts who are going to be armed with the capability of this copilot and everything that it brings. And being able to work together on the team's collaboration platform, we're really turbocharging the capabilities of our analysts. I'm sure there will be productivity gains, but there will also be some real improvements to just the insights that we're able to deliver to our customers.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.Alexander KrammI can't believe I'm asking another Gen AI question, but I will. And it's really on the revenue side because Rob, you obviously highlighted you actually have been utilizing some of these tools, I guess, already in some of your products. I think you had 3 on the slide and you said something about a dozen. So I guess the question really is, can you already isolate some of the, I guess, AI-enabled revenues that you're getting today? And it would obviously be great to have that number.But then more importantly, like how long do you really think until this can really scale? And I guess, any ideas about the TAM? I mean, this is just, ""Hey, we're going to make our products better and we're going to be better in the marketplace and we're going to sell better."" Or do you actually think there's going to be a real unique revenue opportunity here that really wasn't there before?Robert Scott FauberAlex, you know what? That first question is a great question. And I have to be honest, I was thinking about that coming into the call and thinking, ""You know what? Somebody may ask that."" And I don't have that answer at my fingertips, but that's something, I think, that we can follow up on. It's a really good question. And it's a natural question, given the fact that we're spotlighting those products. But let me talk for just a moment about how we're thinking about the monetization opportunity. And again, it's in early days. So just to give you a sense of where we are, we are just in the process of going into what I would call preview mode with a handful of our customers who then can give us feedback on the product. We're thinking then about the, as I said, kind of the pricing and packaging. We're starting with what we're calling a research assistant that will serve our core customer -- investor customer persona, right? So this is the investor that is using our CreditView offering. We will likely make the research assistant available and integrated into the CreditView platform. We may -- so in that case, you could imagine it being an add-on to your CreditView subscription. We also have the ability to call the research assistant, right? And that would allow us to deploy it through, for instance, a platform like Microsoft Teams. And we -- Alex, the exciting thing there is that's going to allow us, I think, to reach a whole new customer base because people who aren't using CreditView today may not have the frequent need to use CreditView, but want to get access to our insights and research. So we're thinking about how do we price that?You can then imagine that we go from that core investor persona to other core personas that we serve. So in banking, it's credit officers and commercial lenders. In insurance, it might be chief risk officers and underwriting staff. And so we will be creating assistants that serve those personas. And so those will be both integrated, as I said with CreditView, likely integrated into our existing offerings. And over time, we would also expect that people would look to have additional content sets entitled with their assistant. So you could imagine that our research assistant comes preloaded with certain content sets. And then over time, if you want to add, say, a climate or ESG content set, that may be an additional entitlement and additional revenue opportunities. So again, Alex, these are great questions. We're working through these as fast as we can. And I think towards the end of this year, we'll probably have more insight into what this looks like, what the size of the opportunity will be. That would be then incorporated into our 2024 outlook.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.Ashish SabadraI just wanted to focus on the free cash flow. That guidance was raised by almost $200 million, which was much better than the EPS guidance range. So I was wondering if you could talk about that. And also from a capital allocation perspective, you've obviously raised the share repurchase guidance from $250 million to $500 million. But how should we think about the rest of the cash and the focus on -- any particular focus on M&amp;A?Mark Bradley KayeIn the second quarter, our free cash flow result of $549 million was significantly higher, to your point, compared to the prior year period. And that's primarily due to an improvement in working capital, as the prior year included, and you'll recall this, a tax-related working capital headwind. And this quarter, of course, we also had stronger net income given the growth in MIS combined with the solid execution in MA. And that means for the second quarter, our free cash flow to GAAP net income conversion was almost 150% compared to just 66% in the prior year. And I would say we're forecasting that conversion rate really to moderate through the rest of the year as some of those first half working capital tailwinds normalize. We're also very pleased to increase our share repurchase guidance to $500 million. That means we're going to return over $1 billion to our shareholders this year, $500 million through that share repo and approximately $550 million through dividends. But the most important thing here is, as a management team, we continue to be committed to anchoring our financial leverage around that BBB+ rating. And that's really because we believe that provides the appropriate balance between lowering the cost of capital and providing for ongoing financial flexibility.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.Toni Michele KaplanWanted to ask about Slide 9. Thank you so much for the additional disclosures by customer type. I guess maybe one on the insurance part of the business. Are you seeing something in the more current, either pipeline or something, that makes the ARR only 6%, whereas the revenue growth is coming in at 12%? Maybe it's timing. And also if you could break down maybe a little bit of the KYC. Obviously, very strong growth there. Just trying to figure out how much is like from new customers versus upselling versus pricing? Any sort of granular drivers would be helpful.Robert Scott FauberYes. Toni, it's Rob. The second part was on KYC, right?Toni Michele KaplanYes.Robert Scott FauberSo as you know, this is why you're asking the question, this has been a strong growth engine for us for some time now. And there's a few things, I think, going on. We're adding both new logos and we are adding and upselling as well. And an interesting couple of stats. The volume of what we call multiproduct deals, so if you think about the components of our KYC solution, it's really the company data that's in Orbis, it's the people data in what we call our GRID database, we've got our adverse media and AI screening, and then we wrap that in a workflow tool, right? So those are all the components. And you can buy the data separately from the workflow or you can buy the data integrated into the workflow. So where our cloud workflow platform is sold with other KYC products, that's up 91%. So we're seeing a lot of customers wanting to opt into the kind of full solution with workflow and data. The volume of what we call multiproduct sales, so where I'm buying multiple components of this solution, is up almost 50%. And where we have what we call sales -- where we have something called company registration verification, so you want to go back down to the source documents themselves, that's another important feature. Actually a company we acquired several years ago. Sales of that as part of our broader suite is up 53%. So that idea of packaging the content with the workflow has really proved to be quite compelling.And I guess, Toni, the other thing just in terms of what's driving overall demand in the space, you've got ongoing changes to regulation, perpetual KYC. And you've also got a broadening of demand beyond just KYC, and so companies who want to understand more about who they're doing business with and supply chain. So that's -- hopefully, that gives you some insight into KYC. The answer is really both new logos and upsells and this bundling of product.On insurance. So remember that this includes our insurance unit now, as I said on the call is, both our legacy MA as well as RMS. And what we don't reflect in that insurance ARR number is the cross-selling synergies that we've got with RMS, which are actually quite robust. And Mark, you might even have a little bit of data on that.Mark Bradley KayeYes. I'd say collectively, Toni, you could think about Rob's remarks as leading us towards that high single-digit ARR for insurance by year end and certainly for high teens or even low 20s for the KYC space.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.Andrew Owen NicholasFrom what we can gather, it seems like issuers, particularly within the high-yield market, are opting for shorter maturities in this environment. And so my question is a 2-parter. First, is this something that you're seeing across that categories of late? And second, how should we think about the impact of this on MIS revenue? Just curious if shorter maturities ultimately results in issuers coming back to market more frequently, which I would think drives stronger transactional revenue. Or if there's some offsetting component within your fee structure that would offset this.Mark Bradley KayeAndrew, I'll start off with some numbers and then I'll turn it over to Rob for additional commentary. I'll do both investment-grade and high-yield just so we got a complete picture here. Between 2020 and, I call it, year-to-date 2023, the average duration of the MIS-rated IG bond issuance peaked in 2020 at about 15 years, and then it steadily reduced to just under 12 years in June, which is about where it was in the pre-COVID 2018, 2019 year. So not a big move on the investment-grade side.On high yield, the comparable numbers for the average duration for what we're rating was somewhere between 7.8 and about 8.3 years. And what we've seen, to your point, is that's been reduced to around 6 years through the first half of 2023.Robert Scott FauberYes. And in fact, I mean, Mark, you cited some of that data. We were getting the opposite questions a couple of years ago as the tenors were stretching out and people worried about whether that was going to lead to less frequent issuance. So this is a happy issue to be contemplating. And to answer your question, I think it just means the issuers are going to be coming to market more frequently. There's nothing in our commercial constructs that I think would offset that. It's unlikely that most of these issuers, especially in high yield, are infrequent issuers. So it's unlikely that they're going to be on more of a relationship-based construct. So I think net-net, this is a modest positive.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.Craig Anthony HuberCan you just talk a little bit further about your debt issuance outlook for full year '23, to break it down a little bit further by category, high-yield and bank loans and structured finance in particular? And also, can I just get the incentive comp number for the quarter on that new basis you guys are using, and what it was a year ago?Mark Bradley KayeGreat. I'll start with the incentive comp. So in the second quarter, the incentive comp was $99 million, and that compared to about $66 million in the prior year period. That brings up our year-to-date incentive comp accrual to $188 million, which is approximately $45 million above the first half. For the full year, we're expecting incentive comp to be between $370 million and $390 million, which is higher, about 25% higher than the comp we accrued for last year. And that's really driven primarily by our improved outlook for full year 2023 MIS revenue.Robert Scott FauberYes. And Craig, so just -- I mean, I think you had a couple of pieces to this. One was kind of leveraged finance. And I would say that, starting with high yield, would describe the environment as cautiously active in the first half of the year. And we did see some oil and gas issuers come back in the market. That's important because they historically have been big issuers in high yield.The leveraged loan issuance was pretty soft. We had a pretty muted sponsor-driven M&amp;A. We did see some refinancing activity and saw at least some supply coming from autos and telcos. When you look at our full year outlook, we've taken high-yield bonds up 15 percentage points to up 40% for the year, off of obviously what was a soft year last year. And we've made a modest adjustment to leveraged loans mid-single digit, up from flat.In terms of kind of what we're seeing in the market right now, Craig, it was a holiday-shortened week to start in July. Things have picked up a little bit in the high-yield market. I would say the tone for both high-yield and leveraged loans is constructive. There's good buyer risk appetite and demand. And then just touching on structured finance, just the volatility and the rising funding costs have led to a slowdown in overall market activity. And there's a lot going on. I would say the weakest areas are CMBS, not surprisingly, given some of the concerns in the commercial real estate sector; and CLOs, just given the lighter leveraged loan supply. So we kind of looked at that, what's going on in the space, and have decided to revise our outlook for structured finance down to -- sorry, to down mid-teens percent for the year. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a flavor.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.Faiza AlwySo I wanted to follow up on that point that you just made, Rob, around structured finance. I'm curious if the competitive environment is a little bit different in structured finance. Are there areas where maybe you're stronger in versus competition? And is that an area of investment focus for you at all?Robert Scott FauberYes, that's a great question. Structured finance has a number of agencies that are active in the market. It's a more transactional market than the fundamental market, which is much more relationship-driven. So we do see a more active, broader competitive landscape in structured finance. I would say in spaces like AMBS -- excuse me, AMBS. ABS. CMBS has a number of active players, CLO a bit fewer just because we rate the -- tend to rate the underlying securities within a CLO.And so I would also note, just when you kind of are looking at what's going on in terms of our structured finance results. If you think about CMBS is a sector where we're quite strong. We have quite a good presence there. And there's been a pretty sharp decline in issuance volumes, again, due to concerns about the office and retail sector. So that decline may be felt more acutely by us, just given our kind of broader coverage of that space and of issuance than perhaps with some other agencies.The last thing I would say is, broadly, our coverage has remained pretty consistent. It does tend to ebb and flow between asset classes a bit from time to time. But broadly, our coverage has remained pretty consistent over the last several years.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo.Seth Robert WeberI was wondering if you could just drill down a little bit more on the FIG revenue, 13% -- up 13% versus issuance up 5%. Just kind of give us some more details on what's going on there.Robert Scott FauberYes. It's -- as we've broadened out the customer base for FIG over the years, and that's included a number of, what I would say, are alternative investment managers and investment managers, we've gotten a little bit more volatility into the results than we have historically. And for those who've been on this call for a long time, you probably remember me saying how FIG is primarily relationship-based and it doesn't move around -- the revenue doesn't move around much.As we broadened that base out, it has. And this quarter, in particular, we saw some opportunistic issuance from the insurance sector, folks who are not typically on these relationship-based constructs. And that gave us a little bit higher revenue take than we might otherwise get on issuance in the FIG space.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America.Heather Nicole BalskyIt's great to see the improvement in MIS. I'm just curious, though, as you kind of look out and you think about the dynamics in the environment, where rates are, kind of where rates might go, what do you think is the biggest overhang right now? Do you think it's the actual rate itself or do you think it's the uncertainty? And do you think kind of incremental certainty kind of this quarter helped with what you saw with regards to issuance?Robert Scott FauberHeather, yes, great question. So I have typically said that it's uncertainty. That is the most challenging thing. And we've said in the past that the market can absorb higher rates when they are: One, accompanied by economic growth; and two, when they are anticipated by the market. So the market does not react well to surprises and it doesn't react well to uncertainty and volatility.Volatility in the markets, both the equity markets and the fixed income markets and with spreads, makes -- creates really challenging issuance environment. So you've seen, as the market has at least gotten certain -- more certainty around the trajectory of rate increases, you've seen issuance firm up. And I think, again, there's still a little bit of headline risk in the remainder of the year, but certainly, we've seen some of the firming in the market.Mark Bradley KayeAnd Heather, if I just add some additional color to Rob's comments there, a few things we're watching. We obviously feel that rates are likely approaching their peaks. We're expecting the Fed to pause, not pivot unless of course there's a sudden increase in unemployment or a collapse in growth. A second thing we're expecting is that the second half recession risks are likely to linger amidst tighter financial conditions. And so we've incorporated a dip, not a severe downturn, into our outlook. And that really means that we are expecting the global default rate to rise above the long-term average but not up to the levels of the pandemic or even remotely close to the Great Financial Crisis.And then thirdly, we're watching a couple of key questions on the matter of thematics, which could include things like are we going to see more stimulus from the Chinese authorities because their post-COVID reopening growth has been pretty lackluster and inflation there is low. And we're also watching the U.S. dollar exchange rate. And then finally, we're also watching the emerging market versus developing market growth rates and the relative differential there.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.Andrew Charles SteinermanMark, could you just tell us the FX effect on second quarter revenues, both from MIS, MA and total? And then if I could ask a second question. Looking at Slide 19, which is the MIS slide, it seems like the first-time mandate projection, which is now $500 million to $600 million, came down from the projections given in April and given more positive view on issuance. I was just hoping you could comment on that dynamic.Mark Bradley KayeAbsolutely. FX is a pretty pedestrian story this quarter. So the second quarter MA revenue was favorably impacted by 0.3%. The impact of foreign currency translation on MCO and MIS revenue is immaterial.Robert Scott FauberYes. Andrew, on the first-time mandates. So first-time mandates were down pretty meaningfully from the same period last year. I'd say we've seen relatively muted first-time mandate activity for probably the past 4 quarters or so. And when you look at, I'd call it, 2019 and maybe the first half of 2020, so kind of a pre-pandemic period, this quarter's first-time mandates were something like 2/3 of that average.But this isn't really -- to me, that's not surprising. So despite the fact that, yes, we're taking up the issuance outlook, the majority of first-time mandates tend to come from leveraged loans. And so as that has been softer, we just haven't seen the same activity around first-time mandates.I will say, though, it's interesting, Andrew. We've seen a very meaningful uptick in our private engagement. So you may have heard us talk about in the past, we have a suite of products, private monitor ratings, private ratings for investors. We have a rating assessment service. Those are up pretty meaningfully. And you heard me mention a number of these issuers have not come to market. So again, we're seeing some kind of pent-up demand on people waiting for the right time to come to market.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.Jeffrey P. MeulerHopefully not too much of a repeat of some prior questions. But as you think about the right pace of spend on AI and Gen AI and the whole generational opportunity, I guess what's the framework for how you think about if you're going fast enough or not fast enough? And to what extent does it tie back to just the business performance? I guess what I'm wondering is, if there's upside or outperformance in the core, just to what extent we should expect that to be reinvested and for you to go even faster on AI for the next couple of quarters.Robert Scott FauberYes, Jeff, it's Rob. I'm going to take this in 2 directions. First, directly to your question, which is we're going to -- we are engaging -- we're starting to engage right now with customers to understand the nature of customer demand with a prototype product or products. And then we are going to think about how much investment do we need to make -- how much demand is there? What does the pricing and packaging look like? And how much investment do we need to make to support that? And I'd mentioned I think a good bit of that investment actually will end up just being compute. But let me take it back one -- to kind of pull the lens back for just a moment because I think there's a broader question here around overall MA investment. And Gen AI is a part of that, but it's not the only part. And I hope you all get a very good sense from us that there are some very strong demand drivers for risk assessment and also that we believe we're very well positioned to monetize that demand. And I think you see that translate to the very strong top line growth rates that we have relative to our peer group. And in thinking about what is best for the long term of the business, as long as we see strong market demand and we have a leading set of -- market-leading set of solutions, we're going to favor investment to drive top line growth. And there are really 3 areas that I want to call out for you. One is product development. Increasingly, this means the integration of our content into workflow solutions like you've heard us talk about. Commercial real estate into our loan origination offering, ESG into our underwriting offering, Orbis data into our KYC offering. It also includes, Jeff, these investments that we're making in Gen AI-enabled products, which we would expect to start delivering revenue growth in '24 and beyond. But this point about investing in an ongoing product pipeline is very important because it's critical to how we get both new customer acquisition and also upsell with customers. That's one.The second is sales deployment. And we have made some big investments in our sales organization over the last couple of years. That includes relationship managers that are now organized by customer segment, and that's helping us with new logos and drive ARR growth. It also includes building out our functions, like what we call our industry practice leads, who can help us with more solutions-based selling and building on our customer success team who helps with retention and upsell. So that's the second area of investment.And the third is we are platforming MA. And we have appointed a chief architect with 20-plus years of experience at Microsoft who is developing an overall technology architecture blueprint, and he is building out our platform engineering layer. And if you join us on our call on September 14, I think you'll have an opportunity to meet with him in the future. But this positions us better for Gen AI enablement and commercialization. It enables faster speed to market and a better experience for our customers who use multiple products. And it also gives us better insight into customer behavior. And again, that is really important to cross-selling and upselling.So the Gen AI investments are one part of a broader set of investments that we're making to really drive and accelerate top line growth at MA and capture the opportunity that's in front of us.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch with Redburn.Russell QuelchSo first question is on MIS, please. I was wondering if the revenues grow back to the levels we saw in 2021 by '24 or '25, as projected by consensus, is there any reason why the adjusted operating margin for the business wouldn't move back up to the same level we've seen in that period, too, please?Mark Bradley KayeI think maybe implicit in what you're asking is why is the MIS margin not higher than the 55% to 56% that we're guiding to, at least for this year? And the short answer here is the margin outlook includes the higher incentive compensation accruals, which are obviously -- or naturally going to flex depending on the performance compared to the targets we set at the beginning of the year, as well as any incremental investments that we put through for in-flight initiatives, including the adoption of AI that we've spoken about this morning.If I think about it more broadly though, the margin guide of 55% to 56% does imply around 370 basis points of uplift compared to our 2022 margin of 51.8%. And if I think about that, that could be attributed to around 350 bps associated with increased operating leverage, and that's primarily tied to that first half issuance. And that's the part that, in theory, could carry forward well beyond 2023.Secondly, I'd say there's approximately 400 bps related to some of the expense benefits from some of the actions we've taken to lower and control costs, for example, those associated with our restructuring program that we spoke about in prior quarters, or additional efficiency initiatives. And then those 2 are offset by around 380 bps from the incremental organic investments that we're putting through. And some of that relates to generative AI and some of it relates to really ensuring that we maintain that best-in-class MIS ratings quality as well as supporting appropriate hiring, merit and promotion increases for our teams.Russell QuelchGot you, okay. That's comprehensive. And just as a quick follow-up in terms of research and insights, obviously saw a strong step-up in growth in recurring revenues there. Can I ask what drove that? How much of that was pricing? Is that new sales, is that cross-sell and upsell? Just any detail you could give to that would be appreciated.Robert Scott FauberYes, sure. Russell, so first of all, we continue to see very good retention and strong demand. And interestingly, when we had that period of particular stress in the U.S. banking sector, we saw utilization of our solutions really spike up. And I'd say there are probably 3 areas that I would point to that are driving growth. One is that point around increased utilization. And interestingly, we have a suite of predictive analytics, economic forecasts and other kinds of models. There has been an uptick in demand for that. So that's one. And that increased utilization, it supports the retention rates, it supports new sales, and it also supports upgrades and price increases. Second, we've made some -- we continue to make ongoing enhancements to CreditView. CreditView is our web-based research platform. That includes something called ESGView. So we now have another view that we are able to either sell on an a la carte basis or to price behind. So we're including more and more content on CreditView that we can use for pricing. ESG is one example. The Orbis content around corporate structure data is another example. And third, we just -- we've seen some very good growth again for the suite of analytics in the research area.Russell QuelchGreat. And also really welcoming this switch to adding incremental color on product and strategy on these conference calls rather than just sort of reading back the results to us. So kudos for that.Robert Scott FauberThanks. I appreciate that feedback. We find that the most valuable way we can spend our time with you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.Jeffrey Marc SilberI know it's late, I apologize. I've got a 2-part question on margins. First on MA, in order to hit your margin goal, you're expecting some pretty sizable expansion in the second half. Are there any timing issues? Were there expenses that you incurred in the first half or maybe some efficiencies that you're incurring in the second half? If you can comment on that. And then on MIS margins. Based on the mixed issuance in terms of your new guidance, is there any impact on margins? Is there a difference if you have an IG debt versus structured finance, et cetera?Mark Bradley KayeLet me take the MA margin from the perspective of a year-to-date and year-to-go onset because I think this will tie in with what you're looking for. So the year-to-date MA adjusted operating margin was 28.4%, and that was about 280 bps lower than the prior year period. And there are 2 primary themes underlying this decrease, and they should be consistent with what we spoke about in the April earnings call.So first, we opportunistically accelerated investment in product, technology, innovation and sales deployment, and that includes the reallocation of expense dollars into our generative AI initiatives. And that really is done with the purpose of allowing us to maximize our ability to meet ongoing customer demand for our solutions. And the second piece is really an element of seasonality, and that relates to both the MA revenue and expenses. And we really try to balance our spending against the full year margin target, which for 2023, is still expanding, albeit slightly.So if you take that into account, what we are thinking of for the second half of the year is really for margins to expand by, on average, 250 to 350 basis points versus the comparable 2022 year-to-go period. And then that means we're going to incrementally step up in the third quarter, and then we'll have a pretty material step-up again in the fourth quarter.Robert Scott FauberYes. And then maybe just some quick rules of thumb in terms of how to think about the relative margin or kind of economic profile of some of the issuance. I would say that if you're in the corporate sector, the leverage -- we tend to get more revenue take on leveraged finance than investment-grade because investment-grade issuers tend to be on more frequent issuer programs. That's typically the same with FIG. You heard what I said about the infrequent insurance issuance. And then in structured, the more complex transactions like CMBS and CLOs typically have more favorable economics. But then if I -- I'll take one -- a different view on it, which is if you look at new issuers versus existing issuers. So in terms of the work required, there's more work that's required for a first-time issuer. So first-time issuers, first-time mandates are great because they build the stock of monitored ratings, but they do take more work. Rating in existing issuer's typically more margin-friendly. So when you see a lot of refinancing activity, that may be a little bit more margin-friendly than a lot of first-time issuance.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities.Simon Alistair Vaughan ClinchRobert, I wanted to ask a question about the competitive environment in MA actually. And just I'm conscious of your partnership with NASDAQ and some of the consolidation that's going on there and the number of different competitors that are sort of vying for different niches of that kind of market that MA is playing, or the various markets. I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint. Who are you displacing? How fragmented the market is? And how you think that's going to really develop over the next 5 years or so?Robert Scott FauberSorry, I might have been on mute. I think the way that we talk about and disclose our businesses is a good way to think about the competitive landscape because in each of those businesses, there are some different players. So for instance, in our research business, we typically will compete against other rating agencies and a handful of kind of more boutique research providers. In the data space, we tend to compete against players like Dun &amp; Bradstreet and others who have big corporate data sets. And then in our Decision Solutions, there are different competitors. So we have different competitors in the banking versus insurance versus KYC space. I will say this though. And while I think we compete with all of them, there is, I think, an element of secret sauce to the way that we compete. And I think it's 2 things. One is an increasingly interoperable suite of cloud-based solutions. So think about with a bank. You can buy our ALM solution. You can buy our loan origination solution. You can buy our regulatory reporting solution. And guess what? They all run on a connected data set. And since they're cloud-based, they're easy to implement. So that really makes it easier for us to kind of land and expand in these institutions.And the second thing is, when I talk about -- I mentioned it in my remarks, this idea of this risk operating system, right? It's all of these data sets and analytics and insights that we have that go way beyond credit now, right? It's credit, it's companies, it's people, it's ESG, it's climate, it's commercial properties and on and on. And the reason that is so important is our customers say to us all the time, ""Hey, I need to be able to integrate. I need to be able to bring in property data, economic forecasts, credit data, ESG scores, physical risk scores relating to climate."" And if a customer has to do that themselves, it's very, very challenging, right? A collection of point solutions and disparate data and analytics providers. So this idea that we can provide a multifaceted view of risk and integrate that and deliver that into our solutions is a very powerful selling proposition with our customers. It allows us -- increasingly is allowing us to displace certain customers, and it's also creating a wonderful pathway for us to grow existing revenue per customer.So that's why I try to draw that out in our remarks because it's a very important differentiator, we believe. And an important reason, by the way. I know sometimes people discount these awards, but it is the reason that we're ranked #1 in the Chartis RiskTech Award. They think that is a winning strategy.OperatorThis concludes Moody's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. As a reminder, immediately following this call, the company will post the MIS revenue breakdown and MA LOB historical revenue under the Investor Resources section of the Moody's IR homepage. Additionally, a replay will be made available immediately after the call on the Moody's IR website. Thank you. You may now disconnect.]"

80,50f04121-9ca6-3a93-9e58-b5d839b655ec,MCO,2023-07-26,Moody's (MCO) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moodys-mco-great-momentum-stock-160006445.html,1690300806,STORY,['MCO'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Moody's (MCO), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Moody's currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for MCO that show why this credit ratings agency shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor MCO, shares are up 1.31% over the past week while the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry is up 0.8% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.61% compares favorably with the industry's 7.09% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Moody's have risen 13.92%, and are up 22.82% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 10.51% and 16.61%, respectively.Investors should also take note of MCO's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, MCO is averaging 721,028 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with MCO.Over the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MCO's consensus estimate, increasing from $9.77 to $9.88 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that MCO is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Moody's on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The exponential growth of DER promises much-needed load flexibility as more renewables come online. DERMS provides the ability to harness that flexibility when and where it's needed.The DERMS technology provides greater visibility into DER behavior and the ability to control DER intelligently. Greater situational awareness allows for more proactive management to keep the grid safe, secure and resilient, while helping utilities provide clean, reliable and affordable energy to their customers.EcoStruxure™ DERMS is a cloud-based, grid-aware software platform, which runs on Microsoft Azure, that integrates, analyzes, and optimizes data from DER—like solar, electric vehicles, battery energy storage, and microgrids. That data then provides electric grid operators with enhanced communication and coordination capabilities to unlock the value of DER as flexible grid resources.""PG&amp;E is partnering with the best and the brightest to deliver breakthrough solutions for our customers. Having efficient and reliable renewable energy resources integrated into the grid, with a powerful DERMS controlling and synchronizing them means that we can continue to grow the share of renewables in the grid while maintaining safe and reliable power,"" said Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer, PG&amp;E Corporation. ""It's a customer-focused energy solution that will bolster reliability and affordability on the path to a clean energy future.""Story continuesPG&amp;E serves more than 16 million people across Northern and Central California, where its customers are often early adopters of new, clean energy technologies. PG&amp;E is taking proactive measures to ensure grid reliability and meet the growing electricity demands of California.PG&amp;E has connected more than 700,000 customers with rooftop solar to the electric grid, and more than 55,000 PG&amp;E residential, business and government customers have installed battery energy storage systems connecting to the grid across PG&amp;E's service area, totaling more than 500 megawatts (MW) of capacity.Over the past few years, PG&amp;E has made significant progress deploying grid-scale battery energy storage. In August of 2020, PG&amp;E had just 6.5 megawatts (MW) of battery energy storage connected to the power grid. Today, PG&amp;E has 1,200 MW of storage capacity operation, and by September this year, it expects to have 1,700 MW online, or enough to meet the instantaneous demand of 1.2 million homes at once. PG&amp;E has contracts for battery energy storage systems totaling more than 3,000 MW to be deployed over the next few years.As outlined in its Climate Strategy Report, PG&amp;E is preparing the grid to power and support three million EVs on the road in its service area by 2030, with goals of more than two million of them participating in vehicle-grid-integration initiatives, allowing EVs to be a cornerstone of both electric reliability and climate resilience.PG&amp;E's Vehicle to Everything (V2X) pilots offer incentives to help customers access new bidirectional charger technology to use their car battery to power their home and send stored power back to the grid on high demand days.DERMs will enable the dispatch of these technologies when California needs energy most.The advantages that EcoStruxure DERMS provides through the advanced management of DER directly supports PG&amp;E's plans for meeting and exceeding California's climate and clean energy goals, while supporting an affordable transition to a highly electrified, renewable grid.A Unified Team for Improved Grid ManagementThe collaboration among Microsoft, PG&amp;E, and Schneider Electric to develop and launch a DERMS strategy symbolizes the power of a unified team with diverse talents and expertise working collaboratively to achieve a new utility-industry standard for integrating DER at scale.Annette Clayton, Chief Executive Officer of Schneider Electric North America, lauded PG&amp;E's comprehensive, cloud-enabled DERMS strategy as an example of Schneider Electric's Grid to Prosumer philosophy. ""This methodology empowers utility companies to digitally transform to achieve their sustainability, efficiency, reliability, and flexibility goals. This approach to optimize distributed energy resources is agile enough to keep up with 21st century demands on the grid. A stepwise approach is key in DER implementation to effectively handle short-term goals and prepare for the long-term vision.""The collaboration builds on Schneider Electric's 30-year co-innovation relationship with Microsoft to deliver  solutions integrating Microsoft Azure, an open cloud computing platform with the tools, scale and security to address the demands of critical energy infrastructure today and in the future.""Collaboration is key to addressing the complex global energy challenges and achieving a more sustainable future,"" remarked Darryl Willis, Corporate Vice President, Energy &amp; Resources Industry at Microsoft. ""Our collaboration showcases the power of combining expertise and leveraging digital innovation to help deliver a future-ready, secure, agile and resilient grid.""Priority Use CasesSchneider Electric's DERMS strategy, ranked the #1 DERMS solution in 2022 Guidehouse Insights Leaderboard, offers a variety of capabilities, and together with Microsoft and PG&amp;E, the companies have identified several foundation use cases for the new system, including:Real-time visibility into all DER.

85,20165a84-ff60-3f4a-84aa-6dfe70ffa00b,ALGN,2023-07-26,"MedTech Stocks' Q2 Earnings Due on Jul 26: DGX, TMO and More",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtech-stocks-q2-earnings-due-150500123.html,1690297500,STORY,"['DGX', 'EW', 'TMO', 'ALGN']","[The second-quarter earnings season for the Medical sector has kicked off. Per the latest Earnings Preview, quarterly results so far have improved year over year despite the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in the form of worldwide inflationary pressure and unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. Going by the sector’s scorecard, 3.4% of the companies in the Medical sector, constituting 12.3% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings till Jul 19. Of these, 100% beat earnings and revenue estimates. Earnings improved 9.3% year over year on 14% higher revenues.However, overall, second-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to plunge 18.6% despite 3.4% revenue growth. This compares with the first-quarter earnings decline of 17.9% on revenue growth of 4%.The projection reflects the ongoing global inflationary pressure, which has resulted in an extremely tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, putting the industry in a tight spot again. The majority of the players within this space witnessed a rise in raw material costs and other expense pressure through the second-quarter months. Added to this, labor-supply constraints due to an increase in labor costs and global supply-chain hazards are expected to have moderated the growth process.MedTech Quarterly SynopsysReplicating the market-wide trend, MedTech or the Zacks-defined Medical Products companies’ collective business growth in the second quarter is likely to have been significantly dampened by the ongoing macroeconomic threat in the United States and outside. Through the second-quarter months, the companies, which are into international trade, are expected to have faced severe currency headwind. During this period, the U.S. dollar remained strong compared to several foreign currencies, which is expected to have had an unfavorable impact on sales.Further, in Medical Device, going by the industry-wide trend, logistical challenges and increasing unit costs are likely to have weighed heavily on the corporate profitability of stocks across the board. On the other hand, the tightened monetary policy starkly altered consumer preferences and once again put the demand for the non-essential category line of medical device businesses on the back foot. This might have, in a way, shrunk the companies’ revenues in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter.Story continuesAlso, diagnostic testing companies might have shown a severe year-over-year decline in testing demand, compared to a strong comparison in the year-ago period on the rise in new cases in select geographies.Medical device companies like Quest Diagnostics DGX, Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO, Edwards Lifesciences EW and Align Technology ALGN are likely to have been influenced by these abovementioned factors in the second quarter.On a positive note, companies’ successful addressing of a couple of years’ pent-up demand is likely to have led to higher year-over-year growth within the legacy base businesses. During the post-pandemic phase, the key focus of medical device R&amp;D has again shifted from COVID-related PPE, testing and distant care options to point-of-care testing, heavy as well as minimally invasive implants, elective procedures and so forth. Accordingly, legacy base business recovery and testing demand of the companies through the months of the second quarter are expected to have been impressive. Meanwhile, AI and robotics for the medical Internet of Things (IoT), which rose to the limelight during the pandemic phase, remained popular.Let's take a look at four MedTech players scheduled to announce second-quarter results on Jul 26.Quest Diagnostics: During the first quarter of 2023, Quest Diagnostics’ COVID-19 testing revenues nosedived to a large extent, with the continuous decline in testing volumes. The company witnessed a downward trend in the demand for COVID-19 molecular testing volumes earlier than anticipated. For the remaining half of the year, Quest Diagnostics’ revised guidance assumes modest COVID-19 revenues following the end of the public health emergency in May. This is likely to be reflected in the second-quarter results.(Read more: Quest Diagnostics to Post Q2 Earnings: What's in Store?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $2.24 billion for the second quarter suggests an 8.6% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for DGX’s earnings of $2.23 per share indicates a 5.5% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Per our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates. This is not the case as you can see below.DGX has an Earnings ESP of -0.95% and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

The company is expected to have recorded growth, driven by a favorable business mix and new launches. The launch of Invitrogen DynaGreen — microplastic-free magnetic beads for protein purification — backed by strong customer adoption, is also expected to have contributed to the second-quarter top line.(Read more: What's in Store for Thermo Fisher in Q2 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Thermo Fisher’s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $10.99 billion, which implies a rise of 0.2% from the year-ago figure.

Price and EPS SurpriseThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. price-eps-surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. QuoteEdwards Lifesciences:  In Critical Care, continued demand for its state-of-the-art HemoSphere monitoring platform and Smart Recovery is likely to be reflected in the second-quarter results of Edwards Lifesciences. An increase in hospital visits with an improvement in the market scenario is likely to have benefited HemoSphere sales, thus adding to the top line. Growth is also expected to have been led by strong adoption of the company’s Acumen IQ sensor and finger cuff, featuring the Hypotension Prediction Index algorithm.(Read more: What's in Store for Edwards Lifesciences in Q2 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Edwards Lifesciences’ second-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.50 billion, which implies a 9.5% improvement from the year-ago figure.

Revenues from non-case products are expected to have been driven by continued growth from the Invisalign Doctors Subscription Program and Vivera Retainers in commerce sales, which include everything from a liner case to whitening and cleaning products.(Read more: Align Technology to Post Q2 Earnings: What's in Store?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings of $2.02 per share implies a 22.7% rise from the year-ago reported figure.

The Windows maker still surpassed estimates for quarterly revenue and profit.On the other hand, Alphabet gained 6.3% after the Google parent's second-quarter profit exceeded Wall Street expectations on steady demand for its cloud services and a rebound in advertising.The NYSE FANG+ index, which houses many megacap growth names, has rallied 76.5% so far this year on optimism over AI and hopes that the Fed is nearing the end of its rate hiking cycle.""Margins and profitability (of Microsoft and Alphabet) will be under the spotlight until investors start to see a significant contribution from AI,"" said Joshua Warner, market analyst at City Index.Meta Platforms rose 1.8% after Alibaba's cloud unit said it would support the Facebook owner's open-source AI model Llama.

Strong replacement demand will continue to boost the company's results.Demand for its construction equipment will likely benefit from anticipated growth in infrastructure investments in the United States. Even though inflated material and labor costs are anticipated to impact the company's margins, the company's effort to improve pricing will somewhat help offset this impact. Product launches equipped with the latest technology to make farming automated will continue to provide Deere with an edge over its competitors.The company is poised to benefit in the long run from rapid growth in the global population and the rising worldwide infrastructure needs.

95,783ce347-3dfc-4635-8c42-48a44db3ed4b,SBUX,2023-07-26,Chipotle Q2 earnings preview: Good news thanks to foot traffic and Chicken al Pastor,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chipotle-q2-earnings-163843669.html,1690303123,STORY,['CMG'],"[Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) reported fiscal second quarter earnings results on Wednesday, July 26, after the market close that showed sales rose less than expected, sending the company's stock down as much as 6.5% in after-hours trading.Revenue grew 13.6% to $2.5 billion as same-store sales rose 7.4%, slightly lower than analyst estimates for sales to rise 7.67% from a year ago. Operating margins also rose last quarter to 17.2%, up from 15.3% a year ago but slightly lower than analyst estimates for margins closer to 17.55%.The company did manage to post a bottom-line beat, with adjusted earnings per share coming in at $12.32, more than the $12.25 expected by analysts.In the third quarter, Chipotle execs expect same-store sales to grow in the low- to mid-single-digit range and 2023 full-year sales to grow in the mid- to high-single-digit range.In the company's earnings release, CEO Brian Niccol said the quarter reflected Chipotle's ""ability to drive strong performance by focusing on exceptional food and exceptional people.""Chipotle stock has gained about 50% so far this year through Wednesday's close.In-restaurant sales, as opposed to online orders, also moved higher last quarter, up 15.8% compared to last year while digital sales made up 38% of total food and beverage revenue.Food, beverage, and packaging costs made up 29.4% of total revenue last quarter, down 100 basis points compared to Q2 2022, in part due to the ""benefit of menu price increases taken in the prior year"" and lower avocado costs, which offset higher prices for other food items such as beef, tortillas, dairy, salsa, beans, and rice.Beef and avocados make up 20% and 9% of Chipotle's food basket, respectively.Its limited-time offering, the Chicken al Pastor, which debuted back in March, also gave a boost this past quarter.In a call with investors, following the results, Chief Financial Officer John Hartung said ""We got a benefit because chicken Al Pastor has really shifted some of our customers from the more expensive beef to the less expensive chicken. That's been a benefit as well.""Story continuesRestaurant-level operating margins came in at 27.5%, slightly higher than estimates of 27.17% and up from last year's second quarter results, at 25.2%.""The improvement was primarily due to the benefit of sales leverage and, to a lesser extent, lower avocado prices. These decreases were partially offset by higher inflation across several food costs, and to a lesser extent, wage inflation,"" the company said in the release.Chipotle is also seeing ""some inflationary pressure"" on the labor front. In Q3, the company expects labor costs to be around 25% compared to 24.3% last quarter.Menu price increases may be on the horizon. Earlier this year the company put a pause on price hikes. ""I think we've proven time and time again that the brand is very strong and the value proposition is very strong, and we have that pricing power to use,"" said CEO Niccol on the call. ""As we get closer to that fourth quarter, we'll make a decision on exactly what we want to do on the pricing front.""Is Chicken Al Pastor the fiscal second quarter hero for Chipotle Mexican Grill? (Courtesy: Chipotle) (Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.)Chipotle is also investing in expansion.Last quarter, the company opened 47 new restaurants with 40 locations including a Chipotlane — what it calls its drive-thrus. In 2023, it plans to open a total of 255 to 285 new restaurants, and 10-15 existing locations will add a Chipotlane.Last week, the company announced its first-ever development agreement to open restaurants in the Middle East and accelerate its international efforts early next year.Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all the results that came out this morning, we now have Q2 results from 122 S&amp;P 500 members or 24.4% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these 122 index members are up +1.2% from the same period last year on +7.1% higher revenues, with 81.1% beating EPS estimates and 63.9% beating revenue estimates. The +1.2% earnings growth pace for this group of 122 index members is the first positive year-over-year earnings growth after 5 back-to-back quarters of declines. The 81.1% EPS beats percentage is not only above what we had seen from this group of 122 S&amp;P 500 members in recent quarters but is also above the 5-year average of 78.7%. This is notable since Q2 estimates had suffered fewer negative revisions relative to other recent quarters. Looking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actuals that have come out with estimates for the sitll to come companies, total earnings are expected to be down -10.4% from the same period last year on -0.4% lower revenues. Excluding the Energy sector drag, Q2 earnings for the rest of the S&amp;P 500 index would be down -4.6% on +3.3% higher revenues.

97,01a6899b-e158-3666-9670-01ef5af28055,SBUX,2023-07-26,Starbucks (SBUX) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-sbux-earnings-expected-grow-140131874.html,1690293691,STORY,"['SBUX', 'SG']","[The market expects Starbucks (SBUX) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis coffee chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.95 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +13.1%.Revenues are expected to be $9.3 billion, up 14.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Starbucks?For Starbucks, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.87%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Starbucks will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Starbucks would post earnings of $0.64 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of +15.63%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Starbucks doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, Sweetgreen, Inc. (SG), is soon expected to post loss of $0.19 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +47.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $154.59 million, up 23.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Sweetgreen, Inc. has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 10.53%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Sweetgreen, Inc. will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Ms. Britt, you may begin.Megan BrittThank you, Alex. Hello, and welcome to the second quarter earnings webcast for ADM. Starting tomorrow, a replay of this webcast will be available on our Investor Relations website. Please turn to Slide 2. Some of our comments and materials may constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risks and uncertainties. ADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation. To the extent permitted under applicable law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events. On today's webcast, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Juan Luciano, will discuss our second quarter results, share progress highlights on our first half accomplishments and provide perspective on our outlook for the second half. Our Chief Financial Officer, Vikram Luthar, will review segment level performance for the quarter and first half and provide an update on our cash generation and capital allocation actions. Juan will have some closing remarks, and then me and Vikram will take your questions. Please turn to Slide 3. I'll now turn the call over to Juan.Story continuesJuan Ricardo LucianoThank you, Megan, and thanks to those who have joined us for today's call. Today, ADM reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.89 with an adjusted segment operating profit of $1.6 billion. Combined with first quarter results, this equates to a first half adjusted earnings per share of $3.98 and an adjusted operating profit of $3.4 billion. Our trailing 4 quarter average adjusted ROIC was 13.8%. The first half of 2023 has probably unfolded as we expected, and our financial performance nearly replicates the record results from the first half of last year, even as we face a more challenging macroeconomic and demand environment to start the year. Through active positioning, strong margin management and leveraging our geographically diverse end-to-end supply chain network, we maintain our earnings power and a strong ROIC performance bolstered by key strategic accomplishments across the enterprise. Please turn to Slide 4. Let me highlight just a few across the business. In Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds, our team leverage past investments in port capabilities to produce record origination volumes out of our Brazilian facilities, expanded our regenerative agriculture partnerships and leverage our ability to flex crush capacity to capitalize on higher canola crush margins. In the latter instance, we flexed more than 300,000 tons of capacity and captured an additional $40 per metric ton of margin. In Carbohydrate Solutions, strategic investments in optimization and modernization allowed our team to manage increased demand for liquid sweeteners, drive growth in BioSolutions revenue and operating profit and produced record results in our milling and international corn businesses. In Nutrition, our unique go-to-market strategy continues to drive a larger sales pipeline and deliver double-digit growth in the Flavors business, thanks to an impressive performance in EMEA and new wins in North America. When you combine all of these aspects across ADM's full business portfolio, it's clear how we are able to convert challenges in one geography, product or business segment into value drivers in another. Next slide, please. Let's review the factors that we see as important drivers for a strong second half finish in 2023. We expect continued strength in Brazil origination for the remainder of the year. Our past strategic investments in port facilities in Brazil, optimize origination network and deep connection to our global trade and destination marketing teams will allow us to export strong volumes, capitalizing on the record Brazilian soybean and corn crops. Biofuels demand continues to remain strong. Through the first half of the year, we saw robust margins from biodiesel, strong demand for ethanol and an increasing demand for vegetable oil from renewable green diesel and we expect these trends to continue in the second half. Our Spiritwood, North Dakota processing facilities is scheduled to start up in Q4, adding 1.5 million metric tons of annual soy crush capacity to our portfolio and producing low carbon intensity soybean oil for our JV partner Marathon's nearby renewable diesel facility. Projects like this will support growing demand for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel throughout the industry. We also see continued resilience in food demand for core products. We expect the continued solid margin and volume environment for sweeteners, starches and flavors. We are beginning to convert our pipeline of wins in Human Nutrition into operating profit. Where there are some factors that have hindered growth in the portfolio, we believe positive momentum from Flavors is a predictor of a healthy rebound. We also see continued commodity market dislocations in the second half. ADM has the unique ability to execute with agility in a dynamic environment. Our team utilizes our unparalleled global asset footprint and end-to-end supply chain to adapt to evolving market conditions and meet global food security needs while driving strong returns. Lastly, our balance sheet remains healthy, and we are flexing it toward organic investments and opportunistic share buybacks. We continue to deploy capital to drive organic productivity and innovation-oriented programs such as Spiritwood, Valencia and Marshall as well as invest in our plant automation efforts and our broad decarbonization initiatives. And our $1 billion in share repurchases in the first half highlights our confidence in the strong cash generation and growth potential of our company. As we look at the back half of the year, we intend to continue our share repurchase program. We feel that these factors are fundamental drivers of our strong second half performance. I am proud of how our team has delivered halfway through the year and even more excited about the opportunities presented in the second half and what our team can deliver. Taking collectively, we are raising our earnings expectations for full year 2023. With that, let me turn it over to Vikram, who will go into more detail on the results of operations. Vikram?Vikram LutharThank you, Juan. Please turn to Slide 6. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team continues to deliver exceptional results in a dynamic environment, leading to an extremely strong performance in the first half of 2023, surpassing the outstanding first half of the prior year. Q2 results were strong, but slightly below the prior year period. Ag Services results were in line with the strong second quarter of 2022. South American origination results were higher year-over-year as the team delivered record volumes and higher margins on strong export demand, leveraging our strategic investments to expand port capacity to capitalize on the record resilient soybean crop. Results for North America origination was slightly lower year-over-year, driven by lower export volumes due to large South America suppliers. Our execution in destination marketing as well as effective risk management continue to deliver strong global trade results, though lower than the record quarter last year. In our Crushing subsegment, results were much lower than the record result from the second quarter last year. Global soy crush margins remained strong but were lower year-over-year in all regions due to softer demand for both meal and oil and a tight U.S. soybean carryout. This was partially offset by strong softseed margins and higher volumes supported by a strong Canadian canola crop and use of our flex capacity in EMEA. Additionally, there were approximately $195 million of negative mark-to-market timing effects in the current quarter that are expected to reverse as the contracts execute in future periods. Refined products and other results were significantly higher than the prior year period, achieving a record second quarter. North America results were higher, driven by strong food oil demand and improved biodiesel volumes. In EMEA, strong export demand for biodiesel and domestic food oil demand supported stronger margins. Additionally, there were approximately $90 million of positive mark-to-market timing effects in the current quarter that are expected to reverse as the contracts execute in future periods. Equity earnings from Wilmar were lower versus the second quarter of 2022. Looking ahead for the third quarter, we anticipate solid results in Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds. We expect strong demand for grain exports to be heavily weighted towards South America and our Brazilian origination footprint. We anticipate strong volumes and margins for soy and canola crush based on the tight Argentine crop and improving demand outlook for meal and oil. We expect RPO to perform well but have significant reversals of timing impacts from the second quarter, leading to lower net execution margins. Slide 7, please. Carbohydrate Solutions delivered strong results in Q2, but lower than the record second quarter of last year. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, capitalized on a solid demand environment during the quarter. North America Starches and Sweeteners delivered volumes and margins similar to the prior years, and ethanol margins were solid as industry stocks moderated but lower relative to the prior year. Q2 results were negatively impacted due to unplanned downtime at one of our corn germ plants. In EMEA, the team effectively managed margins to deliver improved results. The global wheat milling business posted higher margins, supported by steady customer demand. BioSolutions continued on its excellent growth trajectory with 22% revenue growth year-over-year. Vantage Corn Processors results were lower due to lower year-over-year ethanol margins. The prior year period also includes a onetime $50 million benefit from the USDA biofuel producer recovery program. We continue to make progress on our initiatives to decarbonize the Carbohydrate Solutions footprint including our definitive agreement with Tallgrass to sequester carbon from our Columbus, Nebraska facility and continued progress on decarbonizing our decade complex through additional carbon capture and sequestration wells as well as ultra low-carbon intensity, electricity and steam generation. These are key steps in enabling us to produce low CI feedstocks for use in many applications for our major CPG customers and underpinning our growth opportunities, such as SAS, BioSolutions and our lactic acid polylactic acid joint venture with LG Chem. Looking ahead for the third quarter, we expect continued steady demand in margins for our starches, sweeteners and wheat flavor products. Ethanol margins are also expected to remain solid. On Slide 8, Nutrition results were significantly lower than the prior year's record quarter. Human Nutrition results were slightly up year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our Flavors business posted record results in Q2, growing revenues and EBITDA margins due to improved mix and pricing in EMEA as well as improving demand in North America. Flavors will be a significant growth engine for Human Nutrition for the remainder of the year and will act as a pace setter for the rest of our portfolio. Customer innovation in beverage is beginning to accelerate, and our value proposition is driving our sales pipeline to its largest ever. Growth in Flavors was offset by lower year-over-year results in Specialty Ingredients. While there has been softening of demand for plant-based proteins, particularly for the alternative meat space, other categories like alternative dairy, snacks and baked goods as well as specialized nutrition are providing growth opportunities. Although still a small OP contributor, Health and Wellness is seeing demand recovery in probiotics and is benefiting from geographic expansion opportunities offered through ADM's global footprint and customer relationships. Our largest challenge in 2023 has been in the Animal Nutrition business were significantly lower amino acid margins and softer global feed demand has affected volumes driving much lower results. Over the past several months, we have made important adjustments to align the business to this environment, including simplifying our brands and go-to-market strategy, consolidating facilities and optimizing our footprint, rightsizing the workforce in association with these changes and aligning the reporting structure to enhance synergies. We are also refocusing our efforts to increase offerings in the higher-margin specialty feed and ingredients areas. We believe these actions will lead to improved commercial and operational performance, supporting profitable growth when market fundamentals improve. When looking at Nutrition as a whole, we now expect 2023 results to be similar to the prior years as we expect growth in Human Nutrition to be offset by lower results in Animal Nutrition. However, given the increase in customer innovation we've seen in our Flavors business and our recent wins in pipeline growth across Human Nutrition, as well as the actions we are taking in Animal Nutrition, we remain confident about the future outlook and growth prospects for Nutrition. Slide 9, please. Other business results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter due to improved ADM investor services earnings on higher net interest income. Captive insurance improved on premiums from new programs, partially offset by increased claim settlements. In corporate results, net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year, primarily on higher short-term interest rates. Unallocated corporate costs of $262 million was similar versus the prior year as lower health insurance costs were offset by increased global technology spend. Other corporate was unfavorable versus the prior year, primarily due to foreign currency hedges. We still project corporate costs to be approximately $1.5 billion for the year. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was -- of 2023 was approximately 18%, in line with the prior year. For the full year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be between 16% and 19%. Next slide, please. Through the second quarter, we had strong operating cash flows before working capital of $2.5 billion. We allocated $600 million to capital expenditures as well as returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to have ample liquidity with nearly $13 billion of cash and available credit, and our leverage ratio is all low with an adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 1.0x. Our strong balance sheet and credit ratings provide a stable financial footing for ADM to pursue our strategic growth initiatives while also returning capital to shareholders. We still anticipate $1.3 billion of capital expenditures in 2023. As Juan mentioned, we have already completed the $1 billion of share repurchases that we announced in January this year. We intend to continue our share repurchase program, subject to other strategic uses of capital. Based on our very strong first half, we are raising our full year earnings outlook to around $7 per share with potential for even more upside. Juan?Juan Ricardo LucianoThank you, Vikram. As we wrap up today's call, let me highlight a few opportunities that we're excited about as ADM continues to execute our strategic agenda, where we're seeing value generation today and have plans to accelerate. Let's start with digitization and automation. Our ongoing work to modernize and automate our operations is ramping up. Our 8 current implementations across North America and Europe are generating millions in run rate benefits. And we have 10 more starting in Q3 with the expectation of similar scalable benefits. Our 1ADM program is accelerating our decision-making and analytics capabilities across the company, helping us find faster path to productivity. With our HR systems now in place globally, our next milestone is bringing part of the Nutrition flavors business on board. In LatAm, we have implemented technology to optimize trade and commercial processes while digitizing freight and logistics contracting. All of this is helping us reduce costs and make better, faster decisions to deliver value to ADM and our customers. Sustainability and decarbonization have opened new avenues for growth across the enterprise while ensuring we are taking the necessary actions on our own footprint. Our STRIVE 35 program continues to deliver important progress, and our recent sustainability report shows our efforts in greenhouse gas emissions, waste reduction, no deforestation and crop traceability achieving targets ahead of plan. As we continue to support our most significant customers with carbon advantage crop sources, we recently announced regenerative Ag program targets of 2 million acres in 2023 with an additional 2 million acres by 2025. With the recent Tallgrass agreement and permit submissions, CO2 from ADM facilities in Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois is now targeted to be captured and stored safely and permanently underground within our expand indicator CCS well capacity. This helps decarbonize our customers' value chains and our own across important opportunity spaces like BioSolutions and sustainable aviation fuel. And we are continuing to invest in the next phase of innovation. Our new Decatur protein solution center is engaged in ADM's world-class science and technology capabilities to deliver on tomorrow's most important consumer nutrition trends. Collaboration between ADM and our ventures partners take us beyond today's alternative protein sources to help address critical areas of sustainability, wellness and affordability. Leveraging our deep fermentation expertise and capacity is positioning us to scale the next generation of food, feed, fuel, fabrics and other industrial products with key partners. The combination of technology alongside global trends in sustainability, food security and well-being is transforming the food and agriculture industry at the fastest pace since the last century. And ADM is at the forefront of this transformation and connected growth opportunities, which give us even more confidence in our long-range growth plans. Thank you for your time today. Vikram and I look forward to your questions. Alex, please open the line.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question for today comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays.Benjamin M. TheurerSo I'd like to -- just a general question on obviously, like the puts and takes. You're raising your guidance towards the higher end of what 6% to 7% was now around 7%. And obviously, you had a very strong first half, but then at the same time, you're looking for a little more softness in Nutrition. So maybe help us understand how you feel about just macro picture in general demand? What are the geopolitical assumptions that you have behind your outlook and how you feel about second half and then also beyond maybe into 2024 as it relates to general demand in an environment where we're in right now.Juan Ricardo LucianoSure, Ben. Yes, of course, first of all, we're very proud of the results we accomplished in the quarter and in the first half. And certainly, we are more confident about the environment ahead of us for ADM. I would say -- let me highlight some of the reasons for that. Certainly, crush margins have started to pick up as we predicted before. They continue to get better. Both crush has been firmer and mill bases has been stronger and bean bases have dropped in the U.S. as we have anticipated. I think there is a shift in which the world needs more protein, then we need more mill, and we can cover for Argentina shortcomings this year. So that is happening as we predicted. And certainly, it's going to be very good for Q3 and Q4. I think we're seeing these huge crops in Brazil. We see the Brazilian port congestion driving a lower interior basis and allowing us to procure cheaper grains, giving margins to those companies that have invested in the infrastructure to be able to capitalize on that, which we did, both in Santos and in Barcarena in Brazil. So that's playing very well for us. The last time we talked, ethanol inventories were around 25 million to 26 million barrels. Now we are at the end of June at about 22 million. There is -- we see a strong spot demand for ethanol and corn tough to buy. So that has made margins strengthen, and they are holding. So we are positive about ethanol margins continued in that regard. We continue to see this trend in biofuels and we have a strong book on biodiesel for the quarter. So we feel good about that. We are seeing lower recession challenges and the U.S. consumer very resilient, and that's bringing resiliency in our core products for food demand. And we see that in carb solutions, whether it's sweeteners and starches or whether it's in milling. So as you highlighted, of course, and Vikram went deep into that, the issues in Nutrition, I would say we feel good about how our value proposition continues to resonate in flavors. Flavors is more beverage kind of business, if you will. The innovation happens a little bit faster there. So we see our pipeline continues to grow. That bodes very well for what we know the potential revenue is in 2024. So again, we continue to align the company to these big 3 trends, food, security that with all the geopolitics and the weather makes ADM assets more valuable and gives us more margin in destination marketing services, for example. We see health and well-being, and that continues to show in all the flavors innovation that we're seeing with our customers. And we see the sustainability trend driving all these opportunities in decarbonization. I would say we shouldn't forget when we mentioned this, that either in automation on decarbonization, we are at the early innings of multiyear progress for the industry and for ADM. So I think that we feel very good about '23 and we feel even better about the future.OperatorOur next question for today comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens.Benjamin Shelton BienvenuFollow up just on the Nutrition business and maybe to the extent that you can talk a little bit about the cadence as we move through the back half of the year. I appreciate the updated comments on overall results being flat year-over-year. But there's -- with Animal Nutrition expected to be down year-over-year, there's a pretty substantial ramp in the human side of things. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the visibility that you have into that? And then to the extent you can parse between 3Q and 4Q as you see it today, that would be helpful.Vikram LutharYes, Ben. So I think let's just take a few minutes to talk about why our guide has gone from 10% growth to flat. Animal Nutrition cyclical weakness is persisting for longer than we anticipated. Consumers continue to trade down from higher value, more feed intensive to lower value, less feed intensive proteins. Reformulation to reduce feed cost is also impacting volumes. Plant-based proteins, particularly in the alternative meats continues to be softer than anticipated. The destocking actually is still continuing in that category. And the broader market growth has also moderated, which we had signaled before. Third, the demand fulfillment challenges in Pet Solutions are taking longer than anticipated resolve. The delay was driven primarily by slower than anticipated integration of the recent small business acquisition that we made in North America. And if you remember, we had COVID, and that delayed also the integration. So we're working through that. But what are we doing? And that's important as you think about the back half as well as the future. Flavors. Strong pipeline and win rates. We talked about the largest ever pipeline we've had. Flavors actually grew profits in the first half 9%, 20% in Q2. So that's a very good sign of the recovery we are seeing in parts of the Human Nutrition business. The other thing that's important to note, Flavors actually contributed almost 50% of the overall operating profit for Nutrition in the first half. So that's an important signal as you think about the future growth of Nutrition. Yes, that was primarily driven in the beverage category, but we see green shoots of opportunity in the food category as well. In the SI side, we are leveraging our CD&amp;D capabilities to accelerate penetration into some of the faster-growing categories. I mentioned alternative spaces. Alternative meat has been soft but alternative dairy and some of the other categories actually growing. And we are launching our Decatur protein innovation center in Q3. All that, given our CD&amp;D capabilities allows us to pivot to categories that are growing. And that sometimes takes time. So we anticipate that recovery possibly to come in more in the 2024 time frame, less in the back half of this year. In Animal Nutrition, we are taking actions to improve margins, cost and product and footprint rationalization to improve margins and also to drive profitable growth as the markets recover. So we feel good about the recovery as the market recovers. And in panel, what we are doing is looking at the specialty part of our Animal Nutrition portfolio to leverage our Human Nutrition, CD&amp;D and go-to-market capabilities to be able to drive increased penetration there. On the Pet side, demand creation is going to take a little longer, possibly into the back half of this year and into 2024. But overall, we clearly see signs of recovery, and our forward outlook for Nutrition is still strong and robust in terms of growth. This year, given some of the challenges we faced, we expect it to be similar to last year. Juan, I don't know if you want to add some longer-term perspective.Juan Ricardo LucianoListen, Ben, as Vikram said, we continue to be very positive. We look at this -- remember, when we started the Nutrition business, which we're still trying to build into the best nutrition company in the world, we ask our team that we're going to measure them by 2 factors. One was growing faster than market and in markets where the customers are still moving and innovation is coming, like in Flavors, we've seen that we're growing faster than market. And you can see it by the double-digit growth that we have so far. And then the other thing that we said was EBITDA margin on sales growing, and we grew EBITDA marginal sales in Flavors. So I think that in the others, I think Vikram has -- this industry is going through a difficult destocking year. And there has been some self-inflicted things like the integration of this small facility [in Pet]. So I think we're working through some of our growing pains as we build the portfolio. But I think the important thing is our innovation system, our value proposition to bring new recipes to customers faster than anybody else continues to outperform the industry and that we're seeing in the results. When customers have projects like in beverage and all that, we excel. When customers are flat or destocking, it takes a little longer. We still expect the trajectory to be similar in that regard.Benjamin Shelton BienvenuOkay. Very good. My second question is on Starches and Sweeteners. You noted similar volumes and margins in the second quarter. You did have a plan that was down unexpectedly. Could you talk about the impact of that that's discrete to the second quarter? And then you point to solid margins for sweetener, starches and flavor in the back half of this year, would you expect -- would you characterize that more specifically as similar margins and volumes again? Or do you expect an improvement in the back half of the year?Vikram LutharSo Ben, let's talk about the germ crush facility outage. In April, we had an incident at one of our grain elevators at the West plant within ADM's processing complex Decatur. This negatively impacted the Carbohydrate Solutions Q2 results by a significant amount. Germ was actually sold into feed markets as our wet mills were slow to reduce the overall exposure to germ, lowering also ethanol production volumes at a time when ethanol margins were strong. We anticipate this to come back in Q4. So yes, Q2 was impacted. I won't get into the specifics but the fact that it was significant enough for us to call it out means it was a meaningful number. But it is going to come back in Q4. So therefore, based on that, you can expect some seasonality, some shift from Q2 to Q4 as a consequence of that. But for the full year, we still remain very -- we -- the outlook for the full year still remains very strong. The sweeteners and starch and actually also the growth of milling volumes have been very resilient. We've seen some softening in the specialty side of the portfolio, but that's been more than offset by mix and margins. So I'd say, overall, the outlook is solid. And yes, we did have a material impact, a significant impact due to the corn germ in Q2.OperatorOur next question comes from Tom Palmer of JPMorgan.Thomas Hinsdale PalmerPerhaps we could just talk through the moving pieces as we migrate to the North America harvest. We've seen crush margins in the U.S. strengthen, especially in the past month or so. Looks like we've seen maybe just a little bit of a beginning in other regions of the world. I think often, when you see our weaker-than-expected supply coming out of the country, other regions of the world often benefit. And at least up to this point, and I know we're ahead of the harvest, we haven't seen that necessarily in margins. I mean, how do you guys think about as we think about the balance of the year, kind of regional expectations for crush progressing?Juan Ricardo LucianoYes. Thank you, Tom. As I said before, I think that when you see the world needs more protein and certainly, we can see that given the Argentine gap, which is they produce probably 2025 million tons less soybeans and maybe the world was expecting them to produce, that's reallocating crush, reallocating crush to 2 places: reallocating crush to Brazil and reallocating crush to U.S. So of course, the time of that is different. And so we see that in the margins that we see for the U.S. coming into Q3 and then Q4. Demand continues to be strong for meal. There won't be so much protein that is not going to just be soybean meal, but there's going to be other types of protein feed, whether it's feed wheat and all that. So when you take that, combined with the increased demand from fuels, but also oils for food consumption. If we expect soybean oil demand to go up like 8%, it's like about 6% coming from food and maybe 2% coming from fuel. But my point is crush margins are supported from everywhere. Of course, as the world gets to try to cover for these soybeans, the margins will be where you are closer to the physical product to have access to the physical soybeans. And that's where ADM footprint and ADM combined with origination and global trade where we excel. So I think the team had a great first half, and they are expecting a great second half. And we don't see anything that can derail this for quite some time. I hope that provides some perspective.OperatorOur next question comes from Manav Gupta of UBS.Manav GuptaMy quick question here is we are in the second phase where a number of new plants on the RD side will start up in the second half of this year including one of your partners, which is starting up a bigger plant on the West Coast. So I'm just trying to understand from the demand perspective of soya bean oil, do you expect a much stronger demand environment than what we saw in the first half of this year?Juan Ricardo LucianoYes, I think that we have all these plants that are coming that have been announced. And of course, we're looking all the time at the probability of those plants coming. Sometimes when you build in an industry, not everything comes at the right time. But as you said before, there are 2 or 3 large plants coming now in the second half, and that will continue to increase the demand. Of course, our plant in -- from our partner comes with our crush capacity as well that we're building, this 1.5 million tons per year. So -- but Manav, when we look at these we believe that, at the end of the day, that demand will come through. At the end of the day, we will have enough crush for soybean oil to participate being maybe 60% of the overall pool of feedstock needed. And we think that the industry will continue to grow, but we continue to need to attract other feedstocks for us to fulfill this potential. So the industry is going to get tight. You're going to need capacity, technology and capabilities, if you will, in order to deliver that, but that's the way you make progress, building a new industry and going through an energy transition. But that's very favorable for ADM. And I think that we're very pleased to bring in SpiritWood on time for the harvest, on budget. So we are very pleased the way the team has managed that implementation.OperatorOur next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.Adam L. SamuelsonSo I guess my first question, maybe coming back to Nutrition. As I think about the revised outlook for the year, profit now flat. How should we think about the pathway '24, '25 and kind of the achievability of the prior 2025 target, I believe, $1.2 billion of OP in that segment? And maybe the split between human and animal within that, clearly animal has been more pressured than Human Nutrition. So just help me think about kind of -- as we think about the '23 targets, kind of where you are relative to what was implied in your plans to get to the 2025 goals?Juan Ricardo LucianoYes. So when we put the 2025 goals, let me go back on the comments I made before. When we look at our plans, we look at how do we grow faster than market and how do we implement projects and target applications to continue to grow EBITDA margin on sales. The 2 businesses, Animal Nutrition and Human Nutrition had different profiles and different goals in that regard. So when you see the final number is a combination of all those plans roll out. In the Human Nutrition, margins are much higher and is continue to make it better and more stickier to customers as we develop better solutions. In Animal Nutrition was a margin up story since they were coming from lower margins. So when you think about our numbers are a combination of applying our growing faster than market and our EBITDA margin on sales to a market number. Of course, this industry, as you can see by ourselves and our competitors is having through tough times, whether it is because customers are either not innovating fast enough or destocking at this point in time and making sure they have their supply chains in order. So to the extent that those projections are going to be reduced, our percentages of applied to those numbers will be a smaller number. So we haven't gone through that because, to be honest, we are looking at how do we address our current challenges. So we're not that worried about 2025 right now, we want to make sure we make all the adjustments that we need to make. And maybe as we talk about the adjustment, let me talk a little bit about Animal Nutrition. Animal Nutrition, as we become more into the business, if you will. We know there is a commodity part, and there is a specialty part. The specialty part matches very well with the -- what the playbook that we have in the human side. And that part is growing and we will continue to accelerate. And Vikram said before, we are repurposing resources to add more of that. There is a commodity part of that, that at the beginning, when we put the 2 businesses together, we thought it was going to be a good way to open doors, if you will, for the innovation but they have different dynamics. And so we are looking at those different dynamics and how do we need to readjust either the capacities or some of the people associated with that and the intensity of resources in that part as the specialty part is not coming as fast as we thought. So we need to deal with the volatility of the commodity part while the specialty part is a little bit slower. So as those things balance, we are adding productivity to the commodity part of animal, and we are adding more resources to the specialty part in animal and I think that we believe that, that will take us to, again, a growth rate into 2024 for those business. We're going through that. We will cover all that also, Adam in Investor Day as we will have developed more plants. But rest assured, we're very active in our interventions, and we're testing different options in order for us to manage this better. This is also sometimes difficult to characterize on something specific and apply it globally because we have operations in Southeast Asia. We have operations in Brazil. We have operations in Mexico and Europe, in the U.S. And all those things have to be put together and not all the dynamics in all those markets go perfectly aligned and synchronized. So that's why I think we need a little bit more granularity in December to be able to articulate that, which is a little bit more difficult to portray in a call without any numbers or slides.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO.Andrew StrelzikI wanted to ask about your view on the Ag Services strength durability. It seems like we've got tighter global grain supplies than we maybe thought we were going to. Refined oils premiums that are out record. Crush margins, obviously, in the U.S. that are very strong. I know maybe Argentina comes back next year. But it doesn't feel like these are things that even though you guide for just '23 things that would end just because of the calendar flips. And so how long do you think the strength in Ag services can continue for? What I guess, maybe are the risks because it seems like the setup should extend. So curious for your perspective there.Juan Ricardo LucianoYes. Thank you, Andrew. We have had 2 great years of crops in Brazil, and we're probably going to have a strong crop in the U.S. Volumes are good for us. So we like when there are volumes. But of course, the world has become, as you said, more complicated place where is geopolitics and we can see, unfortunately, what is transpiring in the Black Sea or the weather that has become more violent and more volatile. So we go from a very dry La Nina that impacted a lot of locations around the world and then we may go into a more extreme El Nino, and you can see the temperature, record temperatures that we are dealing with right now. So I would say all that volatility and all that uncertainty increases the value of our investments. When we invest more ports in Brazil, we see the leverage that, that has today. Of course, we're going to probably export a little bit less from the U.S. because we're going to export more from Brazil. And that probably is not going to offset each other perfectly. So maybe Ag Services earnings will be down a little bit based on that. But on the other hand, the big availability of crops in the U.S. will help our processing businesses. If you look at the strength in oil is because soybean bases are lower as soybean mill bases have strengthened. So that's where we get the margin expansion. The world also is going into decarbonization, and that's affecting also the grain industry. The grain industry -- and we are leading that with our regeneration program in regen Ag, but more and more people want crops grow in a certain way. And the claims for deforestation limits are also increasing. So I would say you see a future in which maybe less land will be brought into production as we are climbing in the number of people in the world into 10 billion people. But it's not just the number of people. If you think about the protein consumption, the U.S. -- in the U.S., we consumed about 270 punds per year per capita of proteins. China is about 170. The world, on average, is a 100. So if the world was to get to the average of China, we need GBP 70 pounds per person per year. If we were to get to the level of the U.S., you can GBP 170. That's a huge amount of grain that needs to be produced in not an expanding significant amount of land. So there is a lot that we will have to go through. So you will continue to have, given the weather and the geopolitics, you continue to have pockets of tightness where our footprint in the world, all the plants that we've been blessed with and the ports and the logistic assets and our destination marketing people and our origination marketing people, they will be more valuable into the future, no doubt, as we try to secure food for the global population.OperatorOur next question comes from Salvator Tiano from Bank of America.Salvator TianoOn the crush margins, can you provide a little bit more color on why -- in setting aside, of course, Argentina, why Brazil and Europe, the margins have come down recently. And also now with the crush margin curve having gone up, at least the U.S. substantially, where do you stand in your forward hedging book for the balance of the year? And what's kind of your approach going forward?Juan Ricardo LucianoOkay. Yes, Salvator. So as you said, crush margins have weakened maybe in recent weeks to maybe $20 to $30 in Europe, especially this is a good transition through all to new crop in the U.S. and global oil basis maybe have weakened a little bit with firmer U.S. oil. We continue to bring biodiesel from there. So that continues to add value to the European businesses. But maybe the protein industry is a little bit weaker in Europe. In Brazil, I think Brazil, if I have to say something, maybe Brazil is trying to figure out how to accommodate all the production of soybean and corn, that they have. So there are a lot of logistics challenges in Brazil. And I think that has made -- has pressure the beans basis country side. And soybean oil, I would say, is pressure in Brazil because of lack of domestic demand. Brazil is one of those places where you have export market, but you also have a domestic market. And I would say right now, domestic market, maybe for soybean oil is a little bit weak. And without the huge benefit that we have with the biofuels policies here in the U.S. and Brazil may be a little bit weaker. But I would say, realistically, those are the 2 places that will pick up the slack that Argentina or the gap that Argentina left. So those are where the beans are. So we expect high crushing rates for both Brazil and the U.S.OperatorOur final question for today comes from Steve Haynes of Morgan Stanley.Steven Kyle HaynesJust maybe 2 quick ones on Nutrition. First, are you able to maybe put a dollar amount to the cost savings on the various kind of actions you're taking on the animal side of things in regards to kind of what's baked into the 2023 guide. And then secondly, could you just -- maybe just a quick -- a little bit more detail on what some of the inventory losses were on the Tech Solutions (inaudible).Vikram LutharYes. So on the Animal Nutrition side, yes, we've taken a lot of the actions over the course of latter part of last year as well as ongoing this year. I'm not going to call out specific numbers, but I'll tell you the vast majority of those results should be realized in the back half of the year. So it's going to be obviously analyzed as you think about it. But -- so the full benefit would likely come in 2024. So you should see an uplift as a consequence of those actions coming on a full year basis in 2024, but you'll see a partial benefit clearly in 2023 as well. On the inventory losses related to Pet that we called out, it was, again, some of the acquired inventory as part of the integration of this facility that we had referenced, where we've had some integration challenges with the small business that we acquired in 2021. So it is related to some of that acquired inventory and some contamination that we saw. So that's -- it was it was material enough to Pet solutions. That's the reason we called it out, clearly not material from an overall ADM perspective.OperatorThank you. At this time, we currently have no further questions. So I'll hand back to Megan Britt for any further remarks.Megan BrittThank you for joining us today. Please feel free to follow up with me if you have any additional questions. Have a good day, and thanks for your time and interest in ADM.OperatorThank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

This is mainly due to weak North America origination results, which were hurt by lower export volumes due to large South America supplies. However, South America origination results have been solid, driven by record volumes and higher margins stemming from strong export demand. Strategic investments in port capacity to capitalize on the record Brazilian soybean crop bode well.Crushing results have declined year over year, driven by a drab year-over-year performance in global soy crush margins, stemming from muted demand for meal and oil, and a tight US soybean carryout. On the flip side, robust softseed margins and higher volumes, driven by strong Canadian canola crop and the use of its flex capacity in EMEA, acted as upsides.Refined Products and Other results have been robust year over year, benefiting from strong food oil demand and improved biodiesel volumes in North America, as well as robust demand for food oil and export demand for biodiesel in EMEA. Also, equity earnings from Wilmar were lower than that in the year-earlier quarter.The Carbohydrate Solutions segment’s adjusted operating profit plunged 36% to $303 million due to unplanned downtime at one of its corn germ plants. The Starches and Sweeteners sub-segment, including ethanol production from the wet mills, gained from solid demand, as well as robust volumes and margins in North America. Meanwhile, robust margins aided the EMEA region. The global wheat milling business witnessed higher margins, driven by solid demand.Vantage Corn Processors’ results have been soft due to dismal ethanol margins.In the Nutrition segment, the adjusted operating profit of $185 million fell 29% from $239 million in the year-ago quarter. The Human Nutrition unit was flat year over year. The Flavors unit was robust on improved mix and pricing in EMEA, and robust demand in North America. Muted demand for plant-based proteins, particularly in the meat alternatives category in North America and Europe, hurt the Specialty Ingredients unit. The Health &amp; Wellness business was flat year over year due to lower demand for fibers, which somewhat offset lower SG&amp;A costs.The Animal Nutrition unit was weak year over year due to lower margins in amino acids and dismal volumes stemming from soft global feed demand. Also, continued demand fulfillment challenges and inventory losses in Pet Solutions acted as a deterrent.Story continuesOther FinancialsThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) player ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,426 million; long-term debt, including current maturities, of $8,545 million; and shareholders’ equity of $24,975 million.

Let’s take a closer look using quarterly estimates and results from Delta Air Lines DAL as a small guide.Delta Air Lines Q2DAL’s results beat expectations thanks to continued strength in travel demand, registering a 10% EPS beat and delivering a positive 4% sales surprise.

108,5c5a995c-8ae1-3dea-a67f-90085e7f0687,LUV,2023-07-26,20 Most Popular Airlines in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-most-popular-airlines-world-173008233.html,1690306208,STORY,"['601111.SS', 'ALK', 'JBLU', 'AAL', 'DAL', 'CHKIF', 'SAVE', 'AZUL', 'UAL', 'LUV']","[In this article, we will discuss the 20 most popular airlines in the world. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of why passengers opt for certain airlines and know which airlines came at the top, you can take a look at the 5 most popular airlines in the world. Although passengers place significant importance on the price of tickets when deciding which airline to choose, the NATS Aviation Index 2019 shows that the importance of on-board facilities is increasingly growing. Besides this factor, the reputation of the airline is also essential, as 71% of the people said they would never fly with an airline that has a bad reputation. Based on IATA’s 2022 Global Passenger Survey, convenience was the top priority of passengers traveling in post-COVID times. Most of the passengers included in the survey wanted their planning and booking information in one single place. It’s one of the reasons why airline CIOs are prioritizing increased spending on digitalization and sustainability by 2024 — according to SITA’s 2021 Air Transport IT Insights. Airline companies are also looking to invest in technology that reduces flight times. In 2022, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) agreed to buy supersonic planes from Boom. These planes will travel as fast as Mach 1.7, which will significantly reduce flight time. For instance, a 10-hour flight will only take 6 hours on these planes. Previously, United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) also committed to buying 15 supersonic planes. We also found that these airline companies are among the 12 best airline stocks to buy — along with Ryanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ:RYAAY), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK), JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU) and Spirit Airlines, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAVE). During the pandemic, many countries imposed strict travel restrictions to curb the spread of infections. It caused a significant decline in passengers opting for air travel. Even when the restrictions were lifted, the passengers must carry vaccination certificates. Story continuesA significant number of airline staff was also laid off at that time. Bloomberg reported that about 400,000 airline industry workers lost their jobs during the coronavirus. To help U.S. airlines survive, the government provided a $54 billion lifeline. The airlines that got the bailout included Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV), American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) and others. As a lot of people have started choosing air travel again, airline companies might find it challenging to cater to the demand. If you want your travel plans to not be affected, it's important to reach the airport early and consider flying from a smaller airport. In the case of international travel, you should check the health insurance requirements of the country you’re traveling to and arrange it beforehand. 20 Most Popular Airlines in the WorldMethodology For our list of the most popular airlines worldwide, we analyzed Cirium’s Airline Passenger Rankings for 2021.

109,17c4b1ef-1a83-3534-b1dd-379de4fd0df4,LUV,2023-07-26,Frontier Group Holdings (ULCC) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/frontier-group-holdings-ulcc-earnings-140134517.html,1690293694,STORY,['LUV'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Frontier Group Holdings (ULCC) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis discount airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +211.1%.Revenues are expected to be $962.28 million, up 5.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.99% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Frontier Group?For Frontier Group, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.35%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Frontier Group will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Frontier Group would post a loss of $0.08 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.06, delivering a surprise of +25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Frontier Group appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, Southwest Airlines (LUV) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.08 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -16.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $6.99 billion, up 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Southwest has been revised 0.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 2.58%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Southwest will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Delta now expects 2023 earnings (on an adjusted basis) in the band of $6-$7 per share (the earlier view was $6 per share).  Buoyant air travel demand also aided results of two other S&amp;P 500 airline companies that have reported second-quarter 2023 numbers so far.The same tailwinds should help entities like Southwest Airlines LUV, JetBlue Airways JBLU and Copa Holdings CPA post better-than-expected earnings per share for the June quarter.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that are likely to boost the second-quarter results of the sector participants yet to announce earnings.With air travel demand bouncing back strongly from the pandemic lows, results are likely to be impressive. People are again resorting to air travel as they resume their normal activities. Strong passenger volumes are likely to drive results of the yet-to-report airline companies. With the summer holiday period falling partially in the June quarter, passenger volumes are likely to have witnessed an upside.It is well documented that air travel demand is particularly strong on the leisure front. What is more encouraging is that international demand is also bouncing back nicely.The decline in expenses on fuel represents another tailwind for the industry. Notably, oil price declined 6.6% in the April-June period. This bodes well for the bottom-line growth of airlines. This is because fuel expenses are a significant input cost for the aviation space.Here’s How to Pick the Right StocksMultiple airline stocks are likely to report earnings in the coming weeks. Amid this huge population, it is always a daunting task for investors to pick a winning basket of stocks with the potential to deliver better-than-expected earnings.Story continuesWhile there is no foolproof method of choosing outperformers, our proprietary methodology — the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — helps identify stocks with high chances of delivering a positive surprise in their upcoming earnings announcement. Our research shows that for stocks with this perfect mix of elements, the odds of an earnings beat are as high as 70%.The Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our ChoicesSouthwest Airlines is based in Dallas. LUV has an Earnings ESP of +2.58% and a Zacks Rank of 3, currently.

PM posted impressive second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 20, wherein the top and bottom lines increased year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company continued to benefit from strong pricing, especially for combustible products. It also saw a rise in total volumes in the quarter under review due to smoke-free products.Q2 Performance in DetailThe tobacco company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.60, which jumped 16.9% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48.  On a reported basis, the EPS of $1.01 tumbled 29.4%. The company has an impressive surprise history, having surpassed the consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Net revenues of $8,967 million increased 10.5% year over year on an organic basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top line was pegged at $8,690 million.According to Reuters, PM’s quarterly profit experienced a significant boost due to several factors, including the relief from escalating tobacco and labor expenses, as well as strong demand for their smokeless products, Zyn and IQOS. These smoke-free alternatives to conventional cigarettes have become increasingly popular among younger consumers, and the company has made substantial investments in them to capitalize on the growing preference for healthier options.During the quarter, net revenues from combustible products increased 6% to $5,790 million. Revenues from smoke-free products (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) jumped 35.3% to $3,101 million. The company's net revenues from smoke-free goods made up 35.4% of total revenues during the quarter.Increased Shipment VolumeTotal cigarette and HTU shipment volumes increased 3.3% to 188.4 billion units in the quarter, beating our estimate of 183.5 billion units. HTU shipment volumes were driven by a favorable impact of distributor and wholesaler inventory movements.Cigarette shipment volumes dropped 0.4% to 157 billion units in the quarter, while HTU shipment volumes of 31.4 billion units rose 26.6% year over year.Story continuesGuidanceFor 2023, PM expects adjusted EPS in the band of $6.13-$6.22 compared with $5.98 reported in 2022. Excluding currency movements, adjusted EPS is envisioned in the band of $6.46-$6.55, suggesting 8-9.5% growth from the year-ago period figure. On a reported basis, management expects an EPS in the range of $5.36-$5.45 compared with $5.81 reported in 2022.The total cigarette and HTU shipment volume growth for Philip Morris is likely to increase to 1%. HTU shipment volumes are envisioned between 125 billion and 130 billion units. Cigarette shipment volumes are expected to dip 1.5-2.5% in 2023.For 2023, PM expects net revenues to increase nearly 7.5-8.5% on an organic basis. The adjusted operating margin on an organic basis is likely to decline 50-150 basis points.ETF ImpactHere we highlight some ETFs with significant exposure to Philip Morris.Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF FSTAFidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF tracks the MSCI USA IMI Consumer Staples Index.

This is expected to be August 2, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Simon Property to post earnings of $2.91 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 1.69%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.33 billion, up 3.64% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $11.91 per share and revenue of $5.43 billion, which would represent changes of +0.34% and +2.62%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Simon Property should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently.

HCA is set to report its second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share of $4.28 suggests a 1.7% increase from the prior-year figure of $4.21. The consensus mark witnessed one upward estimate revision in the past month against no downward movement. The consensus estimate for second-quarter revenues of $15.6 billion indicates a 5.1% increase from the year-ago reported figure.HCA Healthcare beat the consensus estimate for earnings in three of the prior four quarters and missed on one occasion, with the average surprise being 9%. This is depicted in the graph below:HCA Healthcare, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHCA Healthcare, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHCA Healthcare, Inc. price-eps-surprise | HCA Healthcare, Inc. QuoteBefore we get into what to expect in the to-be-reported quarter in detail, let’s see how the company performed in the last quarter.Q1 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, the hospital company’s adjusted earnings per share of $4.93 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.6%. The quarterly results gained on the back of expanding patient volumes and increased surgeries, which contribute a substantial amount to the top line of HCA Healthcare. However, the upside was partly offset by escalating salaries and benefits expenses.Now let’s see how things have shaped up before the second-quarter earnings announcement.Q2 Factors to NoteIn the second quarter, HCA Healthcare’s revenues are expected to have gained on improved patient volumes. As seniors undergoing elective procedures, which were delayed due to pandemic-related constraints, increased in the second quarter, patient volumes, occupancy rate and other related metrics are expected to have increased for HCA.Our estimate for equivalent admissions indicates a 3% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. We expect emergency room visits to have increased more than 10% year over year in the second quarter. Our estimate for the total number of hospitals is pegged at 182, flat from a year ago.Story continuesOur estimate for outpatient surgery cases suggests nearly 1% year-over-year growth in the quarter under review. We expect revenue per equivalent admission to have increased 0.5% from a year ago. Also, we expect inpatient surgery cases to jump almost 1% year-over-year.Furthermore, our estimate for the occupancy rate is pegged at 71.1% for the second quarter, indicating an increase from the year-ago level of 67.4%. The above-mentioned factors are likely to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth. However, with increased occupancy levels, HCA’s costs and expenses are expected to have increased in the second quarter, partially offsetting the upside.Our estimate for total operating expenses suggests a nearly 5% year-over-year increase due to higher supplies, salaries and benefits costs, affecting profit growth levels, making an earnings beat uncertain. We expect the cost of supplies to have increased more than 6% year-over-year in the quarter under discussion.Also, our model predicts weighted average beds in service to have declined 0.2% year-over-year in the second quarter. We expect equivalent patient days to have witnessed a 1% year-over-year decrease.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for HCA Healthcare this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -1.34%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at $4.22 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.28.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: HCA Healthcare currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for HCA Healthcare, here are some companies from the broader medical space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:SI-BONE, Inc.

(NYSE:PPG) has announced that it will be increasing its periodic dividend on the 12th of September to $0.65, which will be 4.8% higher than last year's comparable payment amount of $0.62. This takes the annual payment to 1.7% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying. View our latest analysis for PPG Industries PPG Industries' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsIf it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. Based on the last payment, PPG Industries was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 58.0%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 30%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendPPG Industries Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.18, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.48. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 7.7% over that duration. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.PPG Industries May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Earnings per share has been crawling upwards at 2.6% per year. Growth of 2.6% may indicate that the company has limited investment opportunity so it is returning its earnings to shareholders instead. This isn't bad in itself, but unless earnings growth pick up we wouldn't expect dividends to grow either.We Really Like PPG Industries' DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for PPG Industries that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

American Banker Staff Writer Kyle Campbell sits down with Yahoo Finance Live to explain the ways in which these guidelines will mitigate risk differently for various forms of credit lending. Campbell describes how these new guidelines will impact certain larger, institutional banks, while examining the exposure regional banks may have to commercial real estate.Video Transcript- All right. On Thursday, just one day after the FOMC's latest interest rate decision, Federal Reserve will unveil a proposal for new bank capital requirements. The proposed rule would also lower the threshold for qualifying banks, meaning smaller institutions will face a new host of demands previously avoided.Fed vice chair for supervision, Michael Barr, outlined a sweeping plan to overhaul bank oversight requirements earlier this month. The proposal, set to come out Thursday, will offer more specifics on just how significant those changes could be.Joining us now with the latest is Kyle Campbell, staff writer at American Banker. Kyle, good to see you here. I talked to Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, about this. He really took a-- I would say, a hard line view of this. This could really be impactful to the economy. What have you been hearing from sources?KYLE CAMPBELL: Yeah, I mean, that's the big concern, right. Banks have been looking forward to this proposal for a long time now. Since 2017 is when the Basel III, they call it endgame, was first finalized, sort of, internationally, and now we're implementing that.Where this is-- what we're going to see on Thursday is just how that's going to impact the economy because we're going to find out which particular activities are going to be given which sort of risk weights under the new framework. So if, let's say, auto lending comes with a much heavier capital penalty, than a lot of banks are sort of forecasting with their internal models currently. It's going to make that type of financing more expensive, essentially.Story continuesAnd there is a view that as capital overall increases, it's just going to have a broader, sort of, tightening impact on the availability of credit broadly in the economy.- Is it really? Or is it just that their margins are going to get smaller? Or both, right?KYLE CAMPBELL: I think it's probably a bit of both but that's a great question. And certainly, consumer advocates are saying, well, look, the way that capital is raised is it's just hurting the bottom line for executives. You just have to retained earnings and you lose that sort of ROE, return on equity, that is what sort of fuels bank profits.So it's certainly going to result in less profitability, at least for some period of time. And again, how that actually impacts the availability of credit to the average person is going to really, I think-- I don't think it's particularly useful to try to forecast the overall picture, but you can get a good sense of how individual banks are going to be impacted by this once we see the specifics on Thursday.- For those banks, let's say a Wells Fargo, that have been struggling for some time, what does this mean for the struggling banks like a Wells Fargo?KYLE CAMPBELL: Wells Fargo, it'll be interesting. I mean, obviously if-- I mean, they've started to sort of move away from mortgages, which is one area where there's going to be a lot of focus. What happens to mortgages. You know, how does it get treated under the capital rules.I mean-- I think that where it's going to be more impactful than at Wells Fargo-- I mean, certainly they're going to be hit to some degree. But I think it's really going to be most impactful on the sort of mid-size banks, if you will. The ones that were in that sort of 100 billion to 250 billion asset range, that are now going to be facing these capital-- these sort of risk capital requirements for the first time.I think the large banks sort of know how to deal with these sort of requirements. And I don't think that a Wells Fargo is going to be as impacted, on a relative basis, as some of the smaller banks.- Let's turn to another issue that the market's been paying a lot of attention to, and that's commercial real estate and the risks associated with commercial real estate. In these earnings reports that we've gotten from banks, several of them announced steps to anticipate losses. To put aside money for losses, potential losses in commercial real estate.Wells Fargo, for example, boosted its allowance for credit losses. So where are we in that sort of situation?KYLE CAMPBELL: Yeah, that's a great question. And certainly, regulators are very focused on commercial real estate, giving some strong warnings to banks to do things like set aside losses and sort of avoid getting new exposures where you can avoid it.And that actually kind of compounds the issue because a lot of these-- I mean, certainly with offices, we know, the ones that are vacant, not getting people in, and that's sort of a whole issue unto itself. But there are some assets where they're kind of performing relatively well but they're going to need some kind of a recapitalization in order to remain viable and not end up as a foreclosure. And in order to do that, you need banks to sort come to the table.So I think what we're going to be looking for is who's going to move first. Are we going to see some of these sort of big capital equity investors, private equity funds, start to come in and say, hey, we're going to move in in a higher equity basis? Or are we going to see some banks say, hey, actually, we're going to be willing to back some of these recap-type strategies through lending?- Is this a potentially destabilizing event for the banking sector?KYLE CAMPBELL: I wouldn't think so.- I'm trying to compare it to what happened earlier this year.KYLE CAMPBELL: Right. Yeah. I mean, I think you're going to see some serious stress. And I wouldn't be surprised if at specific banks, you see some possible failures. I mean, you don't want to throw that term around too lightly. But yeah, it's possible that some banks could either have to be sold or go through some sort of an M&amp;A activity to sort of right the ship here.I wouldn't expect it to get to a level where we're needing to see serious intervention by the government because they're sort of very well aware of what's going on in real time. But these things can snowball pretty quickly. So yeah, it could be something to watch for sure.- Yeah, most definitely. Kyle, thanks for coming in. Good to see you. Kyle Campbell, staff writer at American Banker, covering some various areas of risks for us.]"

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis electronics payment processing company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.58 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9.3%.Revenues are expected to be $2.18 billion, up 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.63% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Global Payments?For Global Payments, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.90%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Global Payments will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Global Payments would post earnings of $2.30 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.40, delivering a surprise of +4.35%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Global Payments doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerWex (WEX), another stock in the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $3.51 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -5.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $620.63 million, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Wex has been revised 0.6% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Wex will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yahoo Finance Live delves into the significant economic impact of these blockbuster events.Video TranscriptALEXANDRA CANAL: But speaking of driving, I want to move on to what's driving the economy and that's Taylor Swift, ""Barbie,"" and Beyonce, OK? We're in this Goldilocks economy right now. We're not too hot, not too cold. But post-COVID, we've seen this surge of people wanting to dive into experiences, live events. On top of that, we have a work-from-home situation which makes it a lot easier to travel.So Axios is out with this new report citing Moody's about how people are traveling more to concerts. Justifying that, I work from my hotel on Friday. I'll go to the Taylor Swift concert here. I'll go over here. It's booming local economies. So it's interesting to see this era. And we were just talking about ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer--""AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --how that boosted the box office in a record-breaking way, how people are spending money on those things and that's leading to a boom of sorts.AKIKO FUJITA: I am a little curious. And I will say I'm a little skeptical about how much remote work plays into that. Now, having said that, we have seen this huge transition from goods into services, right? So people want experiences. They're willing to shell out money. And with Taylor Swift specifically, I thought it was interesting that the Federal Reserve President, Philly Fed President--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes.AKIKO FUJITA: --made a mention of the bookings with hotels seeing the highest post-pandemic and specifically cited Taylor Swift fans coming into town. And what we're seeing is that people are taking advantage of the excitement. Same thing with ""Barbie."" Yes, they had big sponsorships in place, but they also-- your local theater. You're talking about--Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes.AKIKO FUJITA: There are people-- there are businesses who are trying to jump on to that, because consumers are willing to shell out the money.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: And there was-- and there was an interesting report, museums having like Swift promotions. People were coming in town, so they're doing other types of tourist activities, restaurants too. Also reading that-- was it another country that said that, in some city, they boosted inflation? That The Eras--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Sweden--PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: The Eras--ALEXANDRA CANAL: --I think for Beyonce tickets potentially.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I wanted to ask you about this one thing in particular. So ""The New York Times"" had an opinion piece today talking about how women are craving positive women for content that embraces femininity too. The writer wrote something to the lines of, the obvious lesson from the gargantuan success of both ""Barbie"" and ""The Eras Tour"" is that there's a huge underserved market for entertainment that takes the feelings of girls and women seriously. Do you guys agree with that?AKIKO FUJITA: I don't know if I would read into it that seriously. Is It? I mean--ALEXANDRA CANAL: If you look at it at the context of the box office, there's not a ton of female-led stories. And I do think--AKIKO FUJITA: That is true.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --there is a desire for new-- like we were saying, new original content, new types of storytelling, not the same old, same old that we've been seeing. And you're seeing that reflected in the numbers with some of those Marvel superhero films, some of those more franchises not doing so well.

Your host for today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Executive -- Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&amp;A session. I'd now like to turn the floor over to Mr. Kowlzan. Sir, please proceed when you're ready.Mark W. KowlzanThank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results and then I'll be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide further details. I'll then wrap things up and then we'll be glad to take any questions. Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $203 million or $2.24 per share. Excluding special items, second quarter 2023 net income was $209 million or $2.31 per share, compared to the second quarter of 2022's net income of $304 million or $3.23 per share. Second quarter net sales were $2 billion in 2023 and $2.2 billion in 2022. Total company EBITDA for the second quarter, excluding special items, was $418 million in 2023 and $533 million in 2022. Second quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.07 per share for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama mill for paper to containerboard conversion-related activities and closure costs related to corrugated products facilities and design centers. Details of special items for both the second quarter of 2023 and 2022 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release. Excluding special items, the $0.92 per share decrease in second quarter 2023 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2022 was driven primarily by lower volumes in the Packaging segment for $0.90 and Paper segment, $0.07. Lower price and mix in the Packaging segment of $0.47 and higher depreciation expense, $0.09 and higher other converting costs, $0.03. These items were partially offset by lower operating costs of $0.34, primarily driven by lower fiber, energy and chemical costs. We also had higher prices and mix in the Paper segment for $0.12, a lower share count resulting from the share repurchase in the second half of 2022 for $0.13; lower scheduled maintenance outage expenses for $0.03 and lower tax rate for $0.02. The results were $0.35 above the second quarter guidance of $1.96 per share, primarily due to lower operating costs resulting from efficiency and usage initiatives and lower freight and logistics expenses. Looking at our Packaging business. EBITDA excluding special items in the second quarter 2023 of $405 million with sales of $1.8 billion resulted in a margin of 23% versus last year's EBITDA of $525 million and sales of $2.1 billion or a 25% EBITDA margin. Demand in the Packaging segment was about where we expected for the quarter and Tom will discuss this further in a moment. As they did in the first quarter, our employees remained focused on very efficient and cost-effective operations as we balanced our supply according to the demand. Or said another way, we are extremely effective at managing what is in our control. In our mills, this included things like improving our wood yields, producing board closer to nominal basis weights, reducing fiber and chemical usage and running our pulp mills more efficiently, increasing our internal energy generation while also reducing our energy consumption and executing our planned maintenance outages for less cost than we had estimated. Also at our mills and including our corrugated facilities, we closely monitored headcount and overtime as well as usage of materials and supplies in addition to other discretionary spending items. In addition, our mills and plants, together with our logistics and distribution personnel worked effectively to minimize the negative impacts from rail rate increases at certain locations and changes in the mix of shipping locations as we ran our system to demand. Finally, as you know, we temporarily curtailed operations at our Wallula, Washington mill once we exited the planned maintenance outage early in the quarter. This was not a reaction to any change in our views on demand but rather our thoughtful approach to manage containerboard supply as economically as possible. The mill remains temporarily curtailed and we will continue to monitor any potential changes to the strategy along with our outlook for demand during the second half of the year. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business.Story continuesThomas A. HassfurtherThank you, Mark. Total prices and mix in the Packaging segment came in where we anticipated with domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together $0.32 per share below the second quarter of 2022 and also $0.32 per share below the first quarter of 2023. Export containerboard prices were down $0.15 per share versus last year's second quarter and down $0.07 per share compared to the first quarter of 2023. As Mark indicated, Packaging segment volume for the quarter also came in where we expected. Corrugated product shipments were down 9.8% in total and per workday compared to last year's second quarter.Outside sales volume of containerboard was 62,000 tons below last year's second quarter and 33,000 tons above the first quarter of 2023. With last year's box volume tying our shipments' per workday second quarter record, we knew this will be a tough comparison period. As we said on last quarter's call, the same variables that have impacted demand in the last few quarters would continue into the second quarter. The shift of consumer buying preferences more towards service-oriented spending, persistent inflation and higher interest rates continue to negatively impact consumers' purchases of both durable and nondurable goods. Inventory destocking, both in boxes and of our customers' products also continued to varying degrees across our customer bases and the manufacturing index has remained in contraction territory for 8 months in a row now. However, as we talked about last quarter, we expected some improvement relative to the inventory destocking of both customer product and boxes as well as improvements based on certain customers' feedback regarding their business and that is what helped the second quarter shipments improve almost 3% compared to the first quarter. We expect continued positive momentum this quarter, although there is 1 less workday compared to the second quarter. I'll now turn it back to Mark.Mark W. KowlzanThank you, Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA, excluding special items in the second quarter was $39 million with sales of $143 million for a 27% margin compared to the second quarter 2022, EBITDA of $32 million and sales of $150 million or 21% margin. Paper prices and mix were 12% higher than last year's second quarter and less than 1% below the first quarter of 2023. Paper demand remains soft with our sales volume just over 14% below last year's second quarter, which also included some sales from our Jackson, Alabama mill, where there was no volume in this year's second quarter. We ran our International Falls mill to match supply with demand as well as to build some additional inventory during the quarter to prepare for the 9-day planned outage -- maintenance outage that's coming up this third quarter. Similar to the comments I made regarding the Packaging business and for many of the same categories, employees in our Paper business remained focused on efficient and cost-effective operations as they also balanced supply according to demand and delivered outstanding margins for the quarter.I'll now turn it over to Bob.Robert P. MundyThanks, Mark. For the quarter, we generated new second quarter records for cash from operations of $360 million as well as free cash flow of $233 million. Key cash payments during the quarter included capital expenditures of $126 million, common stock dividends of $112 million, cash taxes of $83 million and net interest payments of $30 million. We ended the quarter with $630 million of marketable securities and cash on hand with liquidity of almost $1 billion. I'll now turn it back to Mark.Mark W. KowlzanThanks, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move from the second and into the third quarter, in our Packaging segment, although there is 1 less shipping day for the corrugated business, we expect shipments per day to improve versus the second quarter. However, prices will be lower as a result of previously published domestic containerboard price decreases along with slightly lower export prices. We expect seasonally stronger volumes in our Paper segment from back-to-school shipments, although prices are expected to trend lower based on the recent declines in index prices. Operating and converting costs should trend slightly higher, primarily due to higher recycled fiber prices and seasonal energy cost. Scheduled outage expenses will be higher by approximately $0.06 per share, driven by the scheduled maintenance outage at International Falls, Minnesota. Finally, we estimate that our depreciation expense and tax rate to be slightly higher as well. Considering these items, we expect the third quarter earnings of $1.88 per share. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. Statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in the annual report on Form 10-K and on file with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Jamie, I'd like to open the call up for questions, please.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from George Staphos from Bank of America Securities.George Leon StaphosCongratulations on the operating performance in the quarter. Mark, Bob, Tom, my first question, the excellent, from our vantage point operating performance in 2Q, I guess, the $0.34 or so in lower operating costs. How much of that is embedded in your third quarter guidance? Is there any chance within reasonable probabilities that you could -- given all the efforts that your employees have underway, find further efficiencies and benefits such that there might be some upside tilt to your guidance. So help us think about how operations might be able to benefit? And what's baked into your third quarter guidance?Mark W. KowlzanGeorge, as we always do, we continue to focus on 365 days a year, continuous improvement, operational excellence. One thing we commented on last year as we were moving into 2023 and we were winding down a lot of the major capital projects, we're going to take the approximately 150 engineers and technology personnel in our corporate technology group and really let them focus now on unit operations' optimization. And really work with the box plants and mills on a lot of the new equipment, quite frankly, that have been installed in the last couple of years but really take that to a new level of performance and execution and that's paid off for us this year, as you can see. So my answer is, we will continue in that effort. Nothing is guaranteed but we do obviously perform quite well in general. And I would expect to see similar results going forward. Tom, Bob (inaudible).Robert P. MundyYes, Mark. This is Bob, George. I'll say that from the operating cost perspective, we'll hold on to the performance we had in the second quarter. If you just assume that production volume in the mills is similar to the second, maybe up a little bit, we'll see. Yet, we think our cost per ton stays relatively flat. So to be able to hold on to that even though we know OCC prices will be higher, if you just take the average, they moved up from the end of the second quarter and to supply that across the third quarter, they're up like 12% to 14%. So we'll overcome that plus we have the seasonal electricity rates that hits you as well as some seasonal usage items. So in effect, we'll pretty much be offsetting that by continuing the excellent operating cost performance in the mills and the box plants.Thomas A. HassfurtherGeorge, this is Tom. I would just add 1 last thing. It's very obvious that a lot of this extensive groundwork has taken place. And as our volume increases going forward, we're going to be able to take advantage of this cost position we're in and it will be quite dramatic, I think, going forward as the business conditions change and get more positive.Mark W. KowlzanGeorge, let me add 1 thing. If you looked at our quarter and you looked at month by month, we are running, in not just 1 mill but most of the mill system, we're pushing 99% uptime efficiency -- operational efficiency in our mills. I mean, that's unheard of in the industry. Month of June, we had most of the mills in that category and we had 1 mill in particular that was basically 99.99% uptime efficient. It had no paper breaks. And so we're in a level now. It's obviously -- not many of our competitors are there but that's what we strive to do every day and make it better and better. And so I'm confident we'll continue to see good results.George Leon StaphosIt's a great rundown. And obviously, something we'll all try to continue to remember going forward. Two last ones for me and I'll turn it over. To some degree kind of the obligatory, when we think about the 2Q index pricing changes roughly, roughly, how much of that is baked into your third quarter guidance percentagewise? And what would be left in fourth quarter? And then Tom or Bob or Mark, back to the closures that you mentioned in corrugated, in the design centers, I mean it's kind of self-explanatory but what was -- if there was a common denominator, what were you looking to achieve with the -- whatever reconfiguration you were doing?Thomas A. HassfurtherGeorge, I'll take the closure piece and then I'll turn it over to Bob and he can comment on the pricing changes going forward. But on the closure side, listen, we have continuously tried to make sure that we're rightsized for the business and that we have very efficient operating methods. And part of our whole capital investment has been around making sure that we're as efficient as we possibly can in the plants that make the most sense. So that's been an ongoing process. This is nothing really new. We're just announcing it because it took place in the quarter but there's -- this is small facilities and it's consolidation and some things like that. So that's -- it's kind of more of the normal course of business for us. Bob?Robert P. MundyYes. George, regarding the price. I guess the way to think about it is, in the first quarter, there were 2 drops in prices that occurred during the quarter on the benchmark grade for $30 a ton. And then the second -- and the impact of that is, as we say, it pretty much runs through over a 90-day period. So the bulk of that was reflected in our second quarter numbers. So if you think about what occurred in the second quarter where there was a $20 drop and you sort of ratio that with what happened in the first with a $30 drop, you can sort of get the impact of price in the third quarter. Does that make sense?George Leon StaphosYes, I guess so. I mean, I guess what I'd ask is just how much -- again, not trying to be too precise, I know you can't be, how much of a residual would be left of that for the fourth quarter 5%, 30%?Robert P. MundyFor the fourth quarter, most of it would be from the -- latest drop will be in the third. And the impact will be, like I said, if you sort of compare that to what happened in the first, we gave you the impact -- I mean, yes, in the second quarter. And then so when you would think in the -- no other changes, the fourth should be -- you shouldn't see much of an impact if things sort of hang out where they are right now.OperatorOur next question comes from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research Partners.Mark Adam WeintraubFirst, second quarter record cash flow from operations, pretty interesting in this challenging environment. I mean, one of the things, obviously, is your CapEx has been coming down after all those big projects. Can you sort of just update us on what are your thoughts for CapEx for this year? And preliminarily, if the environment remains challenging, what type of CapEx you might bracket for next year?Mark W. KowlzanYes. Mark, over a year ago, actually, we started getting people thinking about the fact that the heavy projects were winding up. And the big projects that we've been involved in over the last 10 years were really, really coming to fruition. And that 2023 would be a year that we (inaudible) that capital down in the $400 million range. Last year, we were $824 million of capital spending. And we'd -- again, we alerted everybody that this year would be in that $400 level and that's where we are. I fully expect us to finish the year somewhere in that $400 million area. And then we're already talking about the 2024 capital spending plan. And looking at our needs and the opportunities, we feel comfortable right now that the number will continue to be in that $400 million area, unless some opportunity came along that was so outstanding that we felt compelled that we wanted to, to direct capital into that opportunity. So we have that luxury right now. But I think for the benefit of running the business in the uncertain times we're in, $400 million range is a good range to be in and it supports business improvement opportunities along with maintenance capital spending within the mills and box plants.Mark Adam WeintraubGreat. And even at the $400 million, do you still have runway? I think you're referencing to still get some of these operating improvements that we've been seeing in the last couple of quarters. Or does that start running out pretty quickly if the CapEx doesn't go higher?Mark W. KowlzanNo. That's the beauty of it. We're continuing to execute every week on a number of opportunities within the box plants. New equipment installations, new equipment -- significant rebuilds on, modifications on a lot of the production lines. So this is not stopping. The mills, as we talked about, we wound up most of the (inaudible) work at Wallula Mill last year and the woodyard work in the OCC plant. Jackson, Alabama, most of that work has wound up. We're just waiting for the opportunity to move into the final phase of the No. 3 machine at Jackson. But again, we can do all of that and still keep the capital spending in this $400 million range, that provides us an opportunity to really just move forward as we look at what these -- whether it's a customer-driven opportunity or a cost takeout efficiency -- energy efficiency, labor efficiency, we continue to see those opportunities. And where we are right now, I could say, barring some big one-off opportunity, some $400 million number keeps us moving forward with taking advantage of this. Bob?Robert P. MundyAnd just one other thing, Mark is, a lot of the operating cost improvement and things that you're seeing is not necessarily capital related. It's just doing things within the process, watching usage, watching your routines, behaviors, practices, improving upon where you've been before. And a lot of that is not capital driven. It's just -- there's a huge benefit of our operating cost, is managed just by those things as well. Mark, over the last few years, we were doing hundreds of projects in our box plants and mills on an annual basis. Now granted, a lot of them are smaller projects. But literally, we had our entire workforce moving to make improvements in hundreds and hundreds of areas every year. And now that we've been able to slow this process down, we're able to take advantage of that. And now the personnel can really take a much closer look and a deeper dive in how is that equipment running. And from a unit operations effectiveness and efficiency, the operating personnel at the plants and the mills, the technology organization are now really stepping back and looking at all of the new converting lines, the projects at the mills and really assessing. Are these projects doing what we expected them to do? And if not, how do we make it do what we expect it to do. And they're optimizing and fine-tuning and the benefits are what we've seen in the second quarter is a great example and we'll continue to do that.Mark Adam WeintraubAppreciate that. And I'd say it's certainly showing. Just one, if I could go back to the bridge from the second to the third quarter, make sure that I understood, I mean, it sounded like there wasn't going to be any negative pickup in operating costs. And I guess you alluded to like a $0.06 increase in maintenance outages. And so if we look at the $2.31 and we go to $1.88, that would seem to be like $0.37 other, if we take off the $0.06 for the maintenance. So is that primarily impact from price? Or are there other variables to be conscious of when doing that bridge, because it seems kind of high on the -- for a price number?Robert P. MundyYes. No, I think you're pretty close, Mark. If you looked at those 2 items on the -- if we just look at the price and the outages, maybe it's a little bit different than what you were saying. But there's almost probably 90% of the delta right there. And then on the operating cost side, if you take in some of the other things that offset the higher recycled fiber prices and the energy costs that we spoke of, it's -- hopefully, we will be pretty close to a push. And so what you're left with are just a couple of cents here and there. We talked about depreciation. We put that in our release and that just has to do higher depreciation from the second quarter, just has to do with the timing of placing our assets and service based from our capital spending program. And we had some benefits in the second quarter that won't repeat in the third. On the tax side, there were just some favorable tax items from divesting of stock and performance units as well as some state tax law changes that gave us a benefit that don't repeat themselves. So those are the other few items that gets you to that $0.43 change.OperatorOur next question comes from Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo.Unidentified AnalystThis is Alex on for Gabe. I was hoping you could give me some color on the bookings in July and maybe how this is trending compared to June and May? And just thinking about the Q3 volume pickup, I was wondering if you can help parse out how much of that is seasonality in underlying demand.Thomas A. HassfurtherOkay. Alex, this is Tom. Our bookings for July, about halfway through the month is very robust, up 15%, which is great, good start to the quarter. The other thing that we're seeing is, I think that's pretty important. And I want to point out is that a lot of our customers are telling us that some of this destocking is now over with their products and that's very important. So hopefully, that will translate throughout the quarter and certainly going into the fourth quarter for some volume that is, what I would call more predictable. .We still do -- I'll just go ahead and point this out right now, we do have some challenging segments still that we're dealing with, which indicates some of our decline in volume. The ag business, Florida had the worst citrus season they've had since the '30s or '40s. We had hurricanes down there, which completely wiped out some of the tomatoes and all the strawberries for a cycle. We've had flooding in Northern California, which has caused a lot of problems. They -- it's feast or famine there, I guess, in terms of moisture. And then in Eastern Washington also, they had some pretty serious droughts. So that segment has been a drag on us. The Building Products segment was booming during COVID with a lot of remodeling going on and all those sorts of things. And that slowed down dramatically. And now because of high interest rates, it's really slowed down housing starts. So that's been a drag on us, as well as single-use plastic products manufacturers. So those are the segments that have impacted us on a negative point. The ag will recover for sure. The e-com and the food and beverage, those segments have held up significantly better. But I think the key takeaway here going into the second half of the year, is the fact that a lot of this destocking has now finally taken place and I think we'll have more predictability going forward relative to volume.Unidentified AnalystOkay. And I guess as a follow-up question, I'm just curious on your cost bucket side, can you maybe talk about which side of the costs are still being pressured and maybe some cost buckets that are kind of coming down there?Mark W. KowlzanAgain, you're always concerned about fiber cost and energy, transportation, especially on the rail. Rail rates continue to move up. So it's -- and then as we go through the third, into the fourth, we'll be getting into the seasonal cooler months and energy usage along with the cost pressure from that usage. So wood cost is always a factor depending on weather conditions. So it's continuing whole host of all your input and what's happening at any given time.OperatorOur next question comes from Philip Ng from Jefferies.Unidentified AnalystMark, Bob, Tom, this is John (inaudible) on for Phil. I just -- I wanted to start off around the box shipments. I mean you guys have lagged the last few quarters from the overall market, which is generally surprising given your solid track record. Would you consider that more of a factor of the local customers and then feeling more of the pinch that you've kind of called out prior? Or is it you're maybe seeing a little bit more pressure from customers on pricing and you're walking away from some of that business?Thomas A. HassfurtherJohn, this is Tom. I'll take this one. I would say that there are a couple of reasons why our numbers look like they do. #1 is, we had unbelievably tough comps from a year ago. And if you go back, I mean, we were significantly higher than the industry, even much higher than our normal trend. And I think that's because, as I mentioned even back then, the wide segment of business and wide swath of different businesses, whether they're local, national or what segments they're in, all were up significantly during the COVID period. .And as I just mentioned a while ago, a number of those have come down significantly. And I'm talking -- when I say significant, we haven't lost any of these customers but we have some that are down 50-plus percent still at this rate just because there was so much demand during COVID and that demand has shrunk so significantly. So those are the -- those to me are the main reasons why it looks as if we're lagging the industry probably more so than -- and the numbers look so much different than they have in the past.Unidentified AnalystOkay. That's helpful. And just with the pricing that we've seen already come out, so they already realized $90 per ton on the containerboard side. Are you seeing prices erode maybe a little bit quicker on the box side? Or they seem generally in line with historical trends?Thomas A. HassfurtherI'll be -- I got to temper this a little bit in terms of discussing this. But -- what we're seeing is, no, I would say, no way is the box trend worse than the linerboard in medium trend. In fact, I would even say that our observations and what we've heard from our customers, they've been quite surprised that of any linerboard or medium reductions that have taken place. And I would say on the box side, it's very much the same thing.Unidentified AnalystOkay. That's very helpful. And if I could just squeeze one more in. Did -- the box demand progression in the second quarter seemed to get worse from what you had called out month-to-date on the last earnings call through the rest of the quarter. Could you kind of just give us a breakdown of maybe what you were seeing during the quarter? And then if things had weakened, was there any material economic downtime that you guys took to kind of help offset that?Mark W. KowlzanOur volume was pretty much what we expected it to be, which was slightly improving. And June, quite frankly, was very strong. So we felt pretty good as the quarter moved through the months. And again, we saw that in June and we're continuing to see that in July. So I'm not sure...Thomas A. HassfurtherYes, I would just add that we were up about 3% Q2 over Q1 and the trend line continues to look quite favorable. So we'll -- and the beauty of -- the beauty of what we've done and what we talked about on the operating side is that we can flex now, however we need to and to whatever the demands are and do it very cost effectively.Robert P. MundyAnd I'll just add, the economic downtime was pretty much what we had anticipated it to be. So there was no change there from what we were assuming.Unidentified AnalystDoes that mean potentially flat in terms of a ton percentage quarter-over-quarter?Robert P. MundyOn a per ton -- on a per day basis, it's up. It's up. So I think Tom made some comments about what he's seeing, as far as trends now and so forth. So hopefully, that means from a -- on a total basis, even though there's 1 less day, that, that could be something that -- some tailwind there that hopefully we can realize in our numbers.Unidentified AnalystApologies. To clarify what I meant was the economic downtime on a tons basis, you were saying there (inaudible).Robert P. MundyWell, again, we'll have to see. That's always a moving target but I would say in total because we do have less scheduled outages as far from a ton perspective, so we get tons back from that in the third versus the second. There's an additional day of -- in the mills. So you get another day there. So there's another 15,000 tons or so. So and we'll just manage the economic downtime commensurate with that pickup that we're seeing from the second quarter.Operator(Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi.Anthony James PettinariTom, just following up on the July trends that you discussed, the 15% -- up 15%, is that month-over-month or year-over-year? And then you talked about destocking, maybe kind of running its course or maybe being closer to the end. In terms of your own inventories, I mean, you talked about inventories down 11,000 tons from 1Q. Just wondering where your inventories are broadly kind of relative to target levels or comfort levels? Yes, those are my questions.Thomas A. HassfurtherOkay, Anthony. Relative to the July trends, the one thing we have typically started out most quarters, up quite a bit year-over-year and that's no different this quarter. But there's a little more predictability in these numbers than what we've had in the past. And I'm seeing our customers trends of order patterns starting to come more in line with where they had been prior to all this destocking and this big change from -- after COVID. So that's the best I can tell you about the July trends. I'm feeling better about these trends than in the past. And these numbers are (inaudible) up. Don't forget, I mean, when it's bookings, you're talking about not just -- in the month of July, you're talking about August, September, kind of out through the quarter. And so -- but again, these patterns seem to be much more predictable.Relative to the inventories, we didn't talk about export. Export is still a moving target and it's certainly something that we're trying to get our arms around and it seems to change almost on a daily basis in this global demand. So I think we feel comfortable with where our inventories are. And -- but again, we've got the ability to flex some depending on what the demand curves are.Anthony James PettinariOkay. That's helpful. And the 15%, it was year-over-year, not month over month?Thomas A. HassfurtherYes. Yes.Anthony James PettinariYes. Great. And then I guess, -- is there any way to frame kind of the financial impact of the Wallula curtailment? And understanding this is in line with matching supply to demand? Any kind of just broader thoughts on that decision as we go through the year?Mark W. KowlzanAs we were running through the first quarter and into the second quarter, we were running the mills, in many cases, slowed back and just kind of throttling our way through demand. As we got into the springtime and we had our outages taking place, we were into the Wallula outage. And we didn't see the improvement at that time back in April with demand. And so we quickly reassessed our position and realized that it was far better to take the 6 mills that we currently have running and run them very, very efficiently. And then in order to do that, you had to take Wallula and keep it down. So we had Wallula down to the annual outage. So we finished that work and decided to just temporarily idle that mill for the time being as we watch the demand situation. But by doing that, it allowed us to take the 6 other containerboard mills and really optimize them and speed them up to the optimum point on their production curve and take advantage of that. And that's another part of the benefit we saw in the second quarter earnings.Robert P. MundyYes, Anthony. And just to frame it up a little, it's -- as Mark -- you take out the highest cost mill in our system and then you run your lower-cost mills more full out, even though there is a freight penalty from Wallula -- the lowest cost from a freight perspective because of where it ships to. And so you do have a freight penalty by operating that way. But it's probably close to $15 a ton of benefit operating that way versus if we had tried to manage it across the entire system rather than isolating Wallula.Operator(Operator Instructions) And ladies and gentlemen, with that, I'm showing no additional questions, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Kowlzan for any closing remarks.Mark W. KowlzanAgain, thank you for joining us today on the call and look forward to talking to you when we wrap up our third quarter and have our call in October. Have a good day. Thank you.OperatorAnd ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be wrapping up today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

The reported figure was higher than the company’s EPS guidance of $1.96 in the quarter under review. However, the bottom line decreased 28% year over year.The downside was primarily caused by lower volumes in the Packaging and Paper segments. Lower price and mix in the Packaging segment combined with higher depreciation expense and other converting costs were major headwinds.  Nonetheless, lower operating costs, higher prices and mix in the Paper segment, a lower share count and reduced scheduled maintenance outage expenses, and a lower tax rate offset some of these negatives.Including one-time items, earnings in the reported quarter were $2.24 per share compared with the prior-year quarter’s $3.20.Packaging Corporation of America Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePackaging Corporation of America price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Packaging Corporation of America QuoteOperational UpdateSales in the second quarter fell 12.7% year over year to $1,952 million.

Gross profit fell 24.5% year over year to $444.7 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $146 million compared with the prior-year quarter’s $157 million. Adjusted operating income slumped 30% year over year to $146 million.Segment PerformancesPackaging: Sales in this segment decreased 13.4% year over year to $1,790 million in the second quarter of 2023. The figure lagged our estimate of $1,794 million.In the Packaging segment, total corrugated products shipments and shipments per day fell 9.8% year over year. We had anticipated a volume decline of 7%, and an unfavorable price and mix impact of 6.3%.Adjusted operating profit was $286 million compared with $420 million in the prior-year quarter. the metric plunged 32% year over year. Per our model, the estimated segmental adjusted operating income was $251 million, that had factored in a fall of 40.1% from the year-earlier reported figure.Paper: The segment’s revenues were $143 million in the Apr-June quarter, down 4.7% year over year. It missed our estimate of $146 million. The segment reported an adjusted operating profit of $29 million compared with the year-ago quarter’s $23 million. Our projection for the segment’s adjusted operating income was $24.2 million.Segmental sales volume was down 19,000 tons compared with second-quarter 2022 levels. We had expected a positive pricing/mix impact of 9.4% in the second quarter. Volume was expected to be a negative 11.7%.Story continuesCash PositionPackaging Corp had a cash balance of $630 million at second-quarter 2023 end, down from $811 million at the end of the prior-year quarter.OutlookPackaging Corp projects third-quarter 2023 EPS to be $1.88. Shipments per day is anticipated to improve sequentially despite one less shipping day for the corrugated business. Pricing is, however, likely to fall as a result of previously announced domestic containerboard price decreases and lower export pricing.In the Paper segment, volumes are expected to pick up, aided by back-to-school shipments. Prices are suggested to trend lower based on the recent declines in index prices.Operating and converting costs are anticipated to be slightly higher primarily due to elevated recycled fiber prices and seasonal energy cost. Scheduled maintenance planned at International Falls, MN mill is expected to hurt earnings.

140,0a8541c7-32c7-39d6-aea2-fd9359d1dc5a,AIG,2023-07-26,American International Group (AIG) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-international-group-aig-reports-140137128.html,1690293697,STORY,['AIG'],"[The market expects American International Group (AIG) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.54 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +29.4%.Revenues are expected to be $12.28 billion, up 12.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.67% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American International Group?For American International Group, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.56%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that American International Group will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that American International Group would post earnings of $1.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.63, delivering a surprise of +13.99%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.American International Group doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

It has amassed assets over $787.05 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. They also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners.CostsInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.10%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 16.70% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Industrials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Phillips 66 (PSX) accounts for about 1.95% of total assets, followed by Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) and Hp Inc. (HPQ).The top 10 holdings account for about 13.74% of total assets under management.Story continuesPerformance and RiskONEY seeks to match the performance of the Russell 1000 Yield Focused Factor Index before fees and expenses. The Russell 1000 Yield Focused Factor Index reflects the performance of a segment of large-capitalization U.S. equity securities demonstrating a combination of core factors high value, high quality, and low size characteristics, with a focus factor comprising high yield characteristics.The ETF has added about 8.22% so far this year and is up roughly 10.34% in the last one year (as of 07/26/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $83.32 and $102.43.The ETF has a beta of 1.11 and standard deviation of 19.76% for the trailing three-year period. With about 302 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSPDR Russell 1000 Yield Focus ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, ONEY is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $52.23 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $102.93 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LinePassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency.

This has outpaced the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 7.68% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.86% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Phillips 66 as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be August 2, 2023. On that day, Phillips 66 is projected to report earnings of $3.54 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 47.71%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $32.13 billion, down 34.85% from the prior-year quarter.PSX's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $13.72 per share and revenue of $131.37 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -26.98% and -25.23%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Phillips 66. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

152,f2b5a955-770a-30a2-81f2-7bd6bbda79bd,PEG,2023-07-26,PSEG (PEG) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pseg-peg-expected-beat-earnings-140128268.html,1690293688,STORY,"['PEG', 'DTE']","[PSEG (PEG) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis parent company of PSEG Power and Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co. Is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.62 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.1%.Revenues are expected to be $2.03 billion, down 2.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.35% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PSEG?For PSEG, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.94%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that PSEG will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PSEG would post earnings of $1.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.39, delivering a surprise of +14.88%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, DTE Energy (DTE), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.93 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +5.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.78 billion, down 23.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for DTE Energy has been revised 4.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.71%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that DTE Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

The company forecasts revenue in the segment to rise between $900 million and $1 billion to $11 billion in the year.Total revenue at the Reston, Virginia-based company for the second quarter rose 10.5% to $10.15 billion, compared to a Wall Street consensus of $9.45 billion.Net earnings came in at $744 million, or $2.70 per share, ahead of analysts' average estimates of $2.54, according to Refinitiv data.(Reporting by Pratyush Thakur in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar and Maju Samuel)]"

Some major industry players like Boeing BA, General Dynamics GD, Teledyne Technologies TDY and L3Harris Technologies LHX are set to report their results tomorrow.Factors That Influenced Aerospace &amp; Defense StocksPer a recent report by the International Air Transport Association, industry-wide global revenue per kilometer increased 39.1% year over year in May 2023. This is indicative of the steadily growing air passenger traffic across the globe, which in turn is likely to significantly boost the second-quarter results of aerospace and defense stocks, particularly those engaged in commercial aviation.Evidently, Boeing witnessed a solid year-over-year surge of 12.4% in its commercial shipments during the quarter to be reported. With BA being the nation’s largest jet maker, we expect the April-June quarter results of the remaining aerospace majors to reflect a similar improvement in delivery trends. Such solid deliveries might have boosted the overall top as well as bottom-line growth of the Aerospace sector, which houses all aerospace and defense stocks.Stocks that are more focused on combat are also expected to have gained as a result of consistent government support. Notably, a steady order flow observed in the past couple of quarters, along with improving delivery trend in recent times, buoyed by recovering economic trends, is likely to have bolstered the aerospace and defense stocks’ second-quarter revenues.However, persistent headwinds like supply-chain disruption, inflationary pressure along with rising jet fuel prices as well as increasing policy rates by the Federal Reserve might have adversely impacted the industry’s bottom-line performance.Q2 ProjectionsThe Aerospace sector’s earnings are expected to decline 9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Revenues are projected to improve 7.2%.  For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through the latest Earnings Preview.Story continuesAerospace &amp; Defense Stocks to WatchLet's take a look at four defense companies that are scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 earnings on Jul 26 and find out how things might have shaped up prior to the announcements.Boeing’s second-quarter deliveries reflected a solid year-over-year surge of 12.4% in commercial shipments, while defense deliveries went down 5%. Improvement in the company’s commercial shipment is likely to have outweighed the decline in defense shipment, thereby aiding BA’s overall top-line performance.Higher jet deliveries, especially that of 737 aircraft in the past couple of quarters, along with the recent strong order activity and increased aftermarket services, are expected to have contributed to Boeing’s second-quarter cash flow reserve. However, expected abnormal costs in relation to the 787 program, along with periodic expenses, might have had an adverse impact on its bottom line.

NextEra Energy continued its track record of solid execution as reflected in our second quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share grew by approximately 8.6% as we deployed capital for the benefit of FPL customers and leveraged our competitive advantages to extend Energy Resources' renewable leadership position.As the fastest-growing state in the U.S., Florida has underlying population growth and an economy that continues to drive clear investment needs. For years, FPL's strategy has been simple: keep bills affordable, the grid reliable and our customer service exceptional. With our most recent settlement agreement, FPL has a well-established capital plan with clear visibility through 2025 to deliver on this strategy. This quarter, we executed our capital plan with new solar and transmission and distribution infrastructure investments, which led to a greater than 12% increase in regulatory capital employed versus the same quarter last year. As a result, FPL's earnings per share increased by $0.07 year-over-year. We progressed these capital initiatives while keeping customer bills affordable. We continue to run the business efficiently with multiple opportunities to reduce and manage costs. We deploy smart capital that reduces O&amp;M and fuel costs, we embrace innovation and new technologies, and we identify cost savings through our various initiatives.Customers benefit from these actions, including bills that are among the lowest in Florida and well below the national average. FPL is uniquely positioned to extend its best-in-class customer value proposition and deliver long-term growth. Energy Resources' more than 2-decade track record of originating, developing, constructing and operating renewables remains as strong as ever. This quarter, on the strength of new investments, Energy Resources grew adjusted earnings by over 14% year-over-year. We continue to see solid renewables and storage demand. Since our first quarter call, Energy Resources placed over 1,800 megawatts into commercial operations, and has added approximately 1,665 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects to our backlog, which now stands at roughly 20 gigawatts, keeping us on track to achieve our renewable development expectations through 2026.Given all of our competitive advantages, Energy Resources is uniquely positioned to continue to lead the decarbonization of the U.S. economy and be the renewables partner of choice, supporting power, commercial and industrial and eventually, hydrogen customers. We are pleased with the progress we have made at NextEra Energy so far in 2023. For over 18 months, we have operated in a challenging macroeconomic environment with various headwinds. And yet, we have leveraged our competitive advantages to serve customers and deliver on our financial expectations. Through the first half of the year, both businesses have executed well, delivering adjusted EPS growth of approximately 11%.With FPL comprising more than 2/3 of NextEra Energy's business, our well-established capital plan through 2025 provides investors with long-term growth visibility. At Energy Resources, we are leveraging our competitive advantages to continue adding new renewables and storage to our backlog, providing clear visibility to our future earnings growth through 2026. Combined, we believe we are well positioned with strong visibility to deliver on our expectations and create long-term value for shareholders.With that, let's turn to the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2023, FPL reported net income of approximately $1.152 billion or $0.57 per share, an increase of $0.07 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 12.1% year-over-year. We continue to expect FPL to realize roughly 9% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current settlement agreement's 4-year term, which runs through 2025.FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.5 billion for the quarter, and we now expect FPL's full year 2023 capital investments to be between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion. For the 12 months ending June 2023, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. During the quarter, we used approximately $78 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of approximately $1 billion.Our capital projects continue to progress well. As we indicated in our recent Ten-Year Site Plan, solar continues to be the lowest cost alternative for our customers. FPL placed into service roughly 225 megawatts of cost-effective solar in the quarter, bringing the total year-to-date solar additions to nearly 1,200 megawatts. Over the last 2 years, FPL has commissioned over 1,600 megawatts of new solar generation. With 2.5 years remaining under the current settlement agreement, FPL expects to add roughly 3,100 megawatts of incremental solar through 2025. FPL's solar investments allow us to serve strong customer growth while providing clean, affordable generation and avoiding volatile fuel purchases.Over the current 4-year settlement agreement, we continue to expect FPL to make capital investments of between $32 billion to $34 billion. Of that total, we anticipate investing approximately $10 billion in new solar generation and approximately $14 billion to $16 billion in transmission and distribution infrastructure. We remain confident in our total capital plan through 2025 as our cumulative capital investments of approximately $14 billion through June of 2023 are a little ahead of our original time line. Our capital investment plan is well established and by executing on solar deployment and transmission and distribution investments, we are enhancing what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in the industry.I'll turn now to the Florida economy, which continues to demonstrate strong growth. Over the past year, Florida has created roughly 412,000 new private sector jobs, and its unemployment rate continues to decline, currently standing at approximately 2.6%, which is nearly 30% below the U.S. average. Florida consumer sentiment improved roughly 14% compared to the prior year and remains above the U.S. average, while mortgage delinquency rates declined by 55 basis points compared to the prior year. Florida's GDP continues to trend upward and increased over 9% versus a year ago.During the quarter, FPL had solid customer growth with the average number of customers increasing by more than 66,000 from the comparable prior year period. FPL's second quarter retail sales increased by approximately 0.3% year-over-year. We estimate that weather had a slightly negative impact on usage per customer of approximately 0.3% on a year-over-year basis. After taking these factors into account, second quarter retail sales increased roughly 0.6% on a weather-normalized basis from the comparable prior year period, driven primarily by continued solid underlying population growth.Now let's turn to Energy Resources, where second quarter 2023 GAAP earnings were approximately $1.462 billion, or $0.72 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were approximately $781 million or $0.39 per share, which is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.04 year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.10 per share year-over-year. Contributions from our existing clean energy portfolio declined $0.06 per share. This decline was mostly due to a large swing in year-over-year wind resource. This quarter was the lowest second quarter of wind resource on record over the past 30 years, while last year was the highest.The contribution from our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.09 per share, primarily due to higher margins in our customer-facing businesses compared to a relatively weak contribution in the prior year quarter. All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.09 per share. This decline reflects higher interest costs of $0.06 per share, half of which is driven by new borrowing costs to support new investments and half of which is due to higher interest rates.The remaining impact is due to a combination of other factors, including additional costs to support early-stage renewable development investments as we plan for growth in the latter part of the decade. Energy Resources had a solid quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 1,665 megawatts to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now totals roughly 20 gigawatts after taking into account over 1,800 megawatts of new projects placed into service since our first quarter call, which keeps us on track to achieve our renewable development expectations through 2026.Having shared our new expectations just 6 months ago, we are already within the 2023 to 2024 development expectations range and only need roughly 15 gigawatts over the next 3.5 years to achieve the midpoint of the 2023 to 2026 development expectations range.As part of our backlog additions, this quarter, we signed our first contract for a stand-alone battery storage project co-located with an existing wind facility. This 65-megawatt storage project is expected to serve our customers' growing capacity needs in the Southwest Power Pool and be available to monetize pricing arbitrage opportunities in this renewable-rich area of the country.As we have highlighted, we believe there are many more opportunities to monetize the value of our existing 29 gigawatt operating renewables portfolio, including deploying co-located storage like we did here. We are excited to bring this facility into commercial operation.During the quarter, we continue to see solid demand for renewables and storage across power and commercial and industrial customers. After a period of underlying commodity price inflation, supply chain disruption and trade policy risk premiums, we are finally seeing signs of stability, which will be helpful in our customer conversations. We believe renewables remain economically attractive to alternative forms of generation and have positioned ourselves to meet long-term customer demand by expanding our significant pipeline of renewable projects.Today, we have a pipeline of roughly 250 gigawatts of renewables and storage projects in various stages of development. This includes projects in early-stage diligence and our current backlog and is supported by roughly 145 gigawatts of interconnection queue positions. When you combine our significant competitive advantages with our renewable pipeline, we believe Energy Resources is well positioned for growth in our renewables business for years to come. We also remain excited about the opportunity to serve hydrogen customers by leveraging our best-in-class renewables development expertise and early-stage development position. Throughout the quarter, we continue to advocate for smart hydrogen policy that we believe would help the U.S. establish a robust green hydrogen market and drive increased renewables penetration.We also progressed our pipeline of potential green hydrogen opportunities by executing an additional memorandum of understanding to explore developing green hydrogen and related facilities that would integrate into our customers' operations and serve their energy needs. Hydrogen should be thought of as simply another renewables customer class as all our hydrogen-related projects could potentially translate into additional new renewables and with the appropriate regulations begin to contribute to Energy Resources' growth later this decade.Turning now to our consolidated results. For the second quarter of 2023, GAAP earnings attributed to NextEra Energy were approximately $2.795 billion, or $1.38 per share. NextEra Energy recorded approximately $1.777 billion of adjusted earnings and $0.88 of adjusted EPS in the second quarter. Adjusted earnings for -- from the Corporate and Other segment decreased results by $0.04 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest costs.We continue to proactively manage interest rates in multiple ways. First, NextEra Energy has $16 billion of various interest rate swaps to help mitigate the impact of future increases in rates. Second, FPL has features in its settlement agreement to offset higher interest rates, such as reserve amortization and the ROE adjustment mechanism, which became effective on September 1, 2022, due to a sustained rise in the 30-year U.S. Treasury yield. Finally, our focus on continuous improvement through our annual velocity productivity initiative has yielded over $725 million in annual run rate savings ideas over the last 2 years, creating cost savings opportunities to help offset higher interest costs. As always, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations.Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged, and we will be disappointed if we're not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in each year from 2023 to 2026, while at the same time, maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. From 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.Now I'd like to turn to NextEra Energy Partners. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were $486 million and $200 million, respectively, reflecting weaker wind resource. NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to deliver on its 2023 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution.Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners' Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.854 per share -- per common unit, or $3.42 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 12% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this quarter, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its LP distribution per unit over 355% since the IPO.Since our last earnings call, NextEra Energy Partners completed its previously announced acquisition of approximately 690 megawatts of wind and solar assets. With this acquisition, NextEra Energy Partners' renewable portfolio is over 10,000 megawatts, further strengthening its position as the world's seventh largest producer of electricity from the wind and sun. The partnership is well positioned to execute on its simplification plans to become a 100% renewables-focused company.Regarding this simplification plans, in May, we launched the sales process for the Texas natural gas pipeline portfolio and are pleased with our progress as we remain on track to sell the assets by later this year. NextEra Energy Partners expects to use the proceeds from the planned Texas Pipeline portfolio sale, together with the Meade natural gas pipeline sale in 2025 to eliminate the equity buyouts on the 3 near-term convertible equity portfolio financings: STX Midstream, NEP Renewables II and 2019 NEP Pipelines.Upon successful execution of the Texas Pipeline portfolio sale, the partnership does not expect to require equity through 2024 other than opportunistic equity issuances under our at-the-market equity program to fund future growth beyond 2024.Now to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of $486 million and $200 million, respectively, reflecting the adverse impacts of weaker wind resource. The adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution contribution from existing projects declined by approximately $99 million and $49 million, respectively, primarily driven by a large swing in year-over-year wind resource. This quarter was the lowest second quarter of wind resource on record over the past 30 years, while last year was the highest.New projects contributed approximately $49 million of adjusted EBITDA and $5 million of cash available for distribution. Second quarter results for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were positively impacted by the incentive distribution rights fee suspension and provided approximately $38 million of benefit this quarter, partially offsetting the impact of poor wind resource performance.As we previously shared, we expect strong double-digit growth in the second half of the year in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution to support NextEra Energy Partners' LP distribution per unit growth expectations range for the full year 2023. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.From a base of our fourth quarter 2022 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.25, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. However, as we've previously shared with you, we expect to grow at or near the bottom end of that range.For 2023, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February of 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 to $3.74 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2023, to be in the ranges of $2.2 billion to $2.42 billion and $770 million to $860 million, respectively.As a reminder, year-end 2023 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2024 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023. As always, our expectations are subject to our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. In summary, we believe that NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are well positioned to continue delivering long-term value for shareholders and unitholders.At NextEra Energy, the plan is simple, our 2 businesses are deploying capital in renewables and transmission for the benefit of customers, providing visible growth opportunities for shareholders. At FPL, we're executing on our well-established capital investment plan, which allows us to extend our customer value proposition.Florida's strong population growth drives smart capital investment, and running the business efficiently allows us to manage costs for the benefit of both customers and shareholders. FPL comprises more than 2/3 of NextEra Energy's business and provides a significant amount of visibility into capital deployment and earnings growth.At Energy Resources, we're leveraging our more than 20 years of experience and competitive advantages to grow our market share and add to our now roughly 20 gigawatt backlog, providing terrific growth visibility through 2026. We believe these competitive advantages will enable Energy Resources to serve power, commercial and industrial and eventually hydrogen customers. With an opportunity set of $20 billion of capital investment requiring more than 15 gigawatts of new renewables, Energy Resources is well positioned to be the green hydrogen partner of choice, potentially creating new opportunities toward the end of the decade.At NextEra Energy Partners, we're executing on our plans to sell our natural gas pipelines and simplify the business. We continue to add to our renewables and storage portfolio, which now stands at over 10,000 megawatts. With the sale of the Texas natural gas pipeline portfolio expected to be completed by the end of the year, NextEra Energy Partners remains on track to transition to a 100% pure-play renewables company while continuing to deliver LP distribution per unit growth for unitholders.With that, we're happy to answer your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Res.Steven Isaac FleishmanYes. So a couple. First, just on the quarter. The customer supply trading business continues to do well, and you mentioned higher margins. I think Constellation has been talking about that, too. Could you just talk more about what you think is driving that in the supply business?John W. KetchumYes. Sure, Steve. This is John Ketchum. In the customer supply and trading business, we've just seen a lot less competition, number one. And number two, remember, a lot of -- most of the business activity that we do in that group is customer-facing business.Our full requirements business, for example, where we're working with municipalities and cooperatives to help provide their power needs and arrange the capacity and ancillaries and other regulatory requirements they need to manage their business, particularly up in the Northeast. That business is -- because it's had a lot less competition has benefited from significant margins.And please, one of the points I want to make is these arrangements that we enter into in the full requirements business are typically 2 or 3 years, and we're immediately going (inaudible) back-to-back hedging those positions. So I feel great about the risk profile. And again, terrific margins that really match up well with our skill sets, our competitive advantages and our core operations. So that's really the main driver.And I also want to remind folks that when you think about our customer and supply business, we run it at a very, very low VaR. For example, the last quarter, we ran that business roughly at a 2% VaR. So it's a very, very small business risk exposure overall for PMI.Steven Isaac FleishmanOkay. Next question just on...John W. KetchumSteve, one other point I want to make, too, on the customer supply business is that, that business, historically, you can go back 10 years and the customer supply and trading business, including this year, has never contributed more than 10% of NextEra Energy's net income. And I think that's important to keep in mind as well. We run a -- we have a lot of complementary businesses. Obviously, FPL has done well. We have other complementary businesses that Energy Resources on top of our renewable business. But that business has always stayed under 10%, and that's one of the commitments that we make to the rating agencies. And that's true this year as well.Steven Isaac FleishmanOkay. Great. Just -- maybe just the latest you're hearing on the hydrogen -- green hydrogen rules from treasury, both kind of timing and any color of where they are on some of the key issues like matching and additionality.John W. KetchumYes. We have been very vocal around the hydrogen regulations that need to come together. And there's been a debate for those that are familiar with it between whether we have hourly matching or annual matching. And for us, it's very simple. As part of a hydrogen project, you buy an expensive asset called an electrolyzer, which everyone is familiar with.And if you have hourly matching, the net capacity factor, the number of hours a day that you use that electrolyzer are probably less than half the day in most parts of the country. If you have an annual construct, we're able to use that electrolyzer around the clock. And so it's really easy math. I mean, when you have an expensive capital asset and you can use it around the clock, the price of green hydrogen is going to be a lot lower (inaudible) you can only use it less than half the time.And so the industry has come forward with a very constructive proposal, which would have the hourly matching construct not kick in until 2028, you'd have annual until that time period. And we also have supported the fact that you have to have additionality if you're going to go qualify for annual.So if you're qualifying for annual in the hours that the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining, the power, the electrolyzer behind the meter and you are buying off the grid. Well, you're buying from an additional renewable asset that has been constructed and developed to provide electrons to that newly built hydrogen facility. So from an NGO perspective, you're getting additional decarbonization benefits on the grid.So we think we've been very constructive in what we have come forward with. We think it's really important because we want to send the right price signal to OEMs to ramp up production on electrolyzers because electrolyzers being produced at scale is going to be particularly important to declines in green hydrogen prices over time.And so that's where we are in terms of your question around timing. We expect treasury to probably come out with regulations now. We're hoping for August, but it's starting to sound more like September or October. But again, we have built a significant hydrogen pipeline. Parts of it work under either construct and that pipeline is well over $20 billion, and we have the land team out, and we've had them out very aggressively lining up land positions for our hydrogen portfolio that -- the nice thing about that, and which Kirk said it in the remarks, that pipeline is now about 250 gigawatts when you include early due diligence sites.Nobody in our industry has a pipeline like that, nobody. And what's terrific about it is it can be used for dual purpose because hydrogen customers are just a third customer class to sell renewables to. So if the site doesn't work for hydrogen, it will work for our power, C&amp;I customers. So we feel like we're really well positioned, and hydrogen is one of those things that can really provide a nice boom to the development expectations that we've already laid out for you.So we're eager to see what the final regulations say. But I also want to remind folks that hydrogen has a long development cycle, so the contribution that we'll see from hydrogen investments, you would expect over the latter part of the decade.Steven Isaac FleishmanOkay. Last question just on the Texas sales. So I think you said you still expect to get it done by year-end. When would that -- when would you need to or expect to or need to kind of announce transaction to make the year-end? And just how should we think about the recent data points we've seen like the TransCanada, the TC sell-down, Columbia sell-down and Cove Point. I know they're different assets, but just in the context of views on valuation of NET.John W. KetchumYes. Thank you, Steve. So let me take those in order. So in terms of timing, we would hope to be in a position end of the third quarter, early fourth quarter in order to support that end of the year sales time line that we have earmarked. In terms of the valuation, we view these assets as unique.Again, as a reminder, the Texas Pipelines provide 25% of the natural gas supply to Mexico through contracts with PEMEX and the other pipeline assets that support the Texas Pipeline are fully integrated with that pipe. And they provide gas to [Mexico's Agua Dulce], which is a very liquid trading point. And if you look around that area, these are very, very strategic for a number of players. So again, as you all know, it's hard to compare one pipe comp to another. But again, we remain pleased with the progress that we continue to make on the sales transaction.And Steve, I think I said 2% on the VaR, I meant $2 million on the VaR for PMI, just to correct that.OperatorOur next question will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.Shahriar PourrezaLet me just -- as we kind of look at the latest renewable portfolio transactions, the valuations have come in fairly noticeably. Do you guys see any opportunities to kind of leverage [NEER's] platform and other picking up the existing assets or developer books, especially sort of given what seems to still be a tight financing and supply chain position for some of your competitors, while you're seeing improvements with yours, right?John W. KetchumYes, we are. I mean, first of all, let me just comment on the valuations that you see. I mean, I think that -- look, I'm not going to be critical of some of the assets that have come to sale. But if you read through the lines into the details of the structures of those transactions, those are not characterized as high-quality renewable assets.When you look back at what we have developed over the last 20 years and what we continue to develop are very high-quality renewable assets. Most of them are bus bar, they're with high credit counterparty offtakers.They are well situated in areas that benefit from our data analytics around transmission congestion, wind resource, solar resource. Because we have 20 years of experience, I like to believe and look not perfect, but we don't make some of the same mistakes that you see some of the other developers make. And so I feel like we're much better positioned our portfolio is a much better position than some of the other markers that you have seen. So I'd be very, very careful in how you assess portfolio because they're very, very different.The second thing I would say is we look at all third-party M&amp;A opportunities that come available. And we feel like we do have all the competitive advantages, some of which you mentioned, and we buy cheaper, we build cheaper, we operate cheaper. We have a cost of capital advantage. We have a terrific team that really understands how to optimize the value of existing assets. That's the key piece. Repowering assets is something we've always had a very strong track record and it's something that the rest of the industry has struggled with, and that gives us a real leg up in terms of being able to see value that others don't.And then as Kirk mentioned on the call today, we have a benefit and an organic asset that nobody else has, which is the largest fleet in North America that we operate. And so we have the ability to not only repower those existing assets but to find ways to pair them up with storage and take advantage of the stand-alone storage ITC.As you all know, storage used to only be a unique opportunity to pair it with solar. The rules have changed with the stand-alone storage ITC under IRA. So now we pair it with wind. We can build it stand-alone. We're making a lot of progress in that area. We announced one project today where we're starting to see an opportunity, particularly in MISO and SPP and ERCOT, where capacity values and reliability are being priced higher than we've seen them in the past, given some of the shortfalls that they have in those markets, and that just happened to coincide with where most of our wind is.And given the massive existing fleet that we have, which very importantly includes an existing interconnection agreement, our ability to go and pair those assets up with solar or to repower them is unique in this industry, given the 2 decade head start that we have. And so that's a value that we try to bring to M&amp;A opportunities as well when we exercise our other competitive advantages, including our cost of capital advantage.Shahriar PourrezaGot it. Perfect. And then -- and John, it's been a little bit quiet, and it hasn't really been a focus for a lot of investors. But is there any sort of updates around the FEC case as of today? Any change in stance as indicated by the disclosures, any opportunities to settle?John W. KetchumYes. Thank you, Shar, for the question. No new developments. There's really no news there. Again, we would expect just based on historical precedent with the FEC that we would hear back where they have a reasonable belief that they should investigate probably sometime in the first quarter of 2024.OperatorOur next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithSo I wanted to come back to the cadence of the backlog additions just looking at '23-'24 versus '25-'26 there. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing out there in terms of the ability to execute in kind of the [nearer-term] sense to execute against that first bucket versus the latter here? And especially give us a little bit of an update on IRS clarity and what that means for the willingness to commit to close on contracts here, especially maybe now that you have that in hand on transferability, et cetera. How do you think about maybe biasing towards the later years there, just given where we stand already?John W. KetchumYes. Good question, Julien. So let me just start with take that in chunks because everyone knows our development expectations are '23 to '26. So let's just start with the first 2 years, and then we'll talk about second 2 years. So for '23 through '24, we're in great shape. We're already within the range as we had expected to be. And then on '25 and '26, if you go back to the beginning of '22, and you add up where we are today, we've already added 12 gigawatts just in the last 6 quarters. That puts us in great shape against '25 and '26 because now we have 15 gigawatts to get to the midpoint.And if you kind of work backwards from '26, that's 3.5 years to get 15 gigawatts. So we feel like we are really in great position and on track on that build. And I think there's some real tailwinds that we're going to start to see come forward.And I want to explain some dynamics just around what we've seen in the renewable industry, which was part of your question, Julien. Let's just go back to '22. I mean in '22, we saw a lot of supply chain issues that started to surface. And then we saw [here flip up], we saw circumvention that caused some delays. It also caused the shortage of supply because some developers were scrambling for panels that they thought they could get into the country, which I think for a short period of time drove prices up.The great thing is all those '22 projects that got delayed into '23 are now starting to go into commercial operation. That's a really good news for customers because those customers that were digesting that '22 build and waiting for those projects to go COD in the '23 are now coming back to the market. And so we're seeing really strong demand from those folks as we start to look forward.The other benefit of that is as you see you [flip up], issues start to get worked through. We're not seeing the flip up holdbacks that we used to see. So making a lot of progress on that front. When you take that into account with the clarity that we're now seeing around circumvention, we finally have this bright-line rule with the [6-part] tests and as long as you meet 4 of the 6, and you're importing from Southeast Asia, you're okay.And so what we've seen is a relaxation in pricing as a result of that. So now the risk premium that was being charged last year by the import market is starting to come down. The other terrific phenomenon that we're seeing around solar pricing is that Southeast Asia still sets the price for panels in the U.S., but that risk price premium is starting to come down and Southeast Asia really wants a big part of the U.S. market.Why do they want a big part of the U.S. market? They sell panels for $0.20 everywhere else, right? They've been selling panels for $0.40 roughly in the U.S. So they have a lot of room to move. And so as that risk premium comes down around, [you flip] and circumvention, it's forcing prices down in the U.S.At the same time, you're seeing a lot more U.S. supply come online through new module facilities are getting announced, also through cell facilities that will come along with it. And so the bottom line is when you look at the solar picture, it's favorable from an equipment price standpoint because I think you're starting to see a lot of capacity come online that is going to force prices down over time, particularly as you see the U.S. market evolve. And it's no secret with some of the economic data coming out of China that some of those Southeast Asian markets are under pressure with capacity -- excess capacity positions.And so they've got batteries and panels they need to find things to do with. Battery prices are coming down as well. We've finally seen a relaxation of battery prices, really struggling to see -- really struggling in the EV market in China, which has created very much in excess capacity around batteries.And so we're finally starting to see some relaxation there. I think there's been more of a movement around traditional lithium-ion and some of the rare mineral exposure you see there, sodium and other battery forms. And so very encouraged about the landscape there.And then on the wind OEM side, the wind folks are really one of the only ones that can reap the full benefit of domestic content in the full manufacturer incentives. So feel really good about where wind sits as well. So I think as you start to look forward and we started to move through the supply chain issues we saw in '22 of these projects coming online in '23, combined with excess capacity globally around the supply chain feel great there.And let me talk about transferability for a second. There's been a lot of discussion, and I've heard a lot of questions about folks saying, ""Well, how's transferability going to be accounted for? And is it going to be part of the FFO and the FFO to debt metric?"" We feel very good, and we've told investors for a long time that we feel very good that it's in accordance with GAAP, it flows through the tax line for tax credits that get transferred to be included.And so we feel good about where that is heading and that we'll end up with -- in a good place there that FFO to debt question that has surfaced around transferability. So when you put all those pieces together, as we work through some of these headwinds that we've had, we feel very good about where things are heading, and let's just face it. We're just getting started. Renewables are here to stay. They're not going anywhere. And so while we might -- the development process isn't always going to be a straight line. We're in terrific shape and feel very optimistic about the future.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithRight. And actually, John, to that point though, a lot of the dynamics you just talked about are very like real time, if you will, versus kind of trailing into the quarter itself. How do you feel about just that contracting acceleration here in the back half? I mean a lot of the points you made would really argue that you could see an uptick versus kind of something that was more on trend in the last quarter.John W. KetchumYes. A lot of it is going to depend on -- as I said before, these '22 projects continuing to come online in 2023 and those customers that had a little bit of fatigue, so to speak, around those delays coming back to market, which we're starting to see. And so that will be the wild card. But we feel good about how the rest of the year continues to shape up.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithGot it. We'll stay tuned on that front. All right. Excellent.John W. KetchumAnd Julien, one other thing to add to that is hydrogen. We get the right rules there. And again, I can't stress it enough. I mean, we've always only had 2 customer classes for renewables. It's been power sector. It's been the C&amp;I sector. Now with the right rules, we have the potential to add a third customer class, which is the renewables for hydrogen customers, and that's exciting as well.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithYes. Yes. So stay tuned, maybe a quarter or 2 after you get those rules to really see that flow through in that third customer class?John W. KetchumYes, I think that's right. And then remember, those projects have longer lead time development cycles. So in terms of the contribution that investors should expect, it's going to come in the latter part of the decade.OperatorOur next question will come from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.David Keith ArcaroMaybe shifting a little bit to NEP. I was wondering -- I know you don't -- in terms of the financing outlook, you don't need equity for some time here, but I was wondering if you could just give any latest thoughts on alternative financing approaches to hit longer-term growth projections at NEP?John W. KetchumYes. I mean for NEP, first of all, the focus is on the simplification strategy, which we shared with the market back in May. And we have said that our expectation as a result of that is we don't -- assuming a successful execution on that sale that we don't expect to have equity requirements in 2024 other than opportunistic equity issuances under our ATM to help finance growth beyond 2024.But if you look, and you can see in the slides here that we have a lot of flexibility under our current metrics with the agencies in terms of the ability to add additional, what I would call, traditional debt-based capital market financing mechanisms to accommodate the growth going forward. And we are very busy looking at the back end, 3 (inaudible) that we have and some ideas around how we are going to address those as well because when we move on from the simplification transaction, that's going to be the next point of focus. We're not -- but we're not waiting. We're continuing to look at [that].And look, there continues to be a strong bid for and interest in renewable -- interest in renewable assets long term, particularly when you think about the opportunity to do that with the world's leader in renewable development with the competitive advantages that we have, the 20 gigawatt backlog, the growth visibility, the (inaudible) going forward, all very promising. And so we continue to engage in those discussions as well as we think about the future.David Keith ArcaroGot it. Got it. And then also, I just had a question related to the transmission constraints that we've seen in the industry, but you made the comment about a very large interconnection position, 145 gigawatts. I was just wondering if you could speak to the transmission queue challenges. And do you think that could potentially be a constraint on growth for the industry at any point? Or how much visibility do you have into hitting longer-term growth targets with that massive queue that you've got in place?John W. KetchumYes. So let me take that in 2 pieces. I mean, 1 is the 145 gigawatts that you're referencing, David, around the 250 gigawatt pipeline that we have -- we already have, with the 145 interconnection position secured, I would challenge you to find anybody in the industry that has even close to that number of projects with interconnection capacity. And don't forget, given the demand we're seeing in the market, if you have a site ready to go with interconnection capacity, that's the hard part, finding the customer right now is not the hard part. And -- so that's why we have such a focus on making sure that our early-stage development program is right on track, and I feel just terrific about where we stand there today.Let me take the second piece, though, that you have, which is just about transmission in general. We are not waiting. We are taking the transmission and interconnect issues into our own hands. And we're doing that through NextEra Energy Transmission. We are laser focused on competitive transmission build-out around where our renewable assets are going and where they are going to be built.We announced a project last quarter, another $400 million opportunity in Cal ISO. I'm not going to talk about them today, but we have a number of various other transmission projects on the board right now that we are evaluating. That business is going terrific.And again, the bottom line message for investors is we're not waiting. We're taking that into our own hands. That's why we bought GridLiance. That's why we continue to make investments in that space, and we intend to solve those problems ourselves as we go along.OperatorOur next question will come from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs.Carly S. DavenportJust wanted to go back to the supply chain, and thanks for the commentary there in the earlier question. But just in terms of rate of change from a supply chain perspective relative to recent quarters, are you seeing any divergence between trends in wind projects versus solar projects?John W. KetchumIn terms -- yes, I mean in terms of wind projects, let me just make a couple of comments there. I mean, we do almost all of our businesses with GE. We've done a little bit with Siemens. And I know there's been some press on Siemens recently. We don't have any of the Siemens Gamesa turbines in our fleet. I just want to make that very clear.As we think about supply chain around wind versus solar, remember that wind turbines are made almost exclusively in the U.S. And so there'll be direct beneficiaries of the [manufacturer] incentives, and we hope domestic content. They have a couple of paperwork, things they have to work out with treasury, which hopefully, will get there on in terms of what kind of information they have to share with their ultimate customers and giving away the secret sauce on margins and all those things.But they continue to work through those issues. But when just doesn't have the same exposure and issues that we've had to deal with, with solar or around you flip or around circumvention. But again, as I said earlier, those issues around solar, which really plagued the industry back in '22 have been things that we've been working through in '23. And now we're starting to see a lot more capacity show up not only in the U.S., but in other markets as well. And so we are capitalizing on all those opportunities and leveraging our buying power as you would expect us to do.Carly S. DavenportGreat. That's helpful. And then the follow-up is just a quick one on kind of the cost environment. It seems like it's starting to improve a bit, but still challenging for many. Can you just talk about how you're managing costs in this environment and kind of what levers exist that are available to pull if needed to continue to execute at a high level from an earnings perspective?John W. KetchumYes. Thanks, Carly. So we spoke on our last call about, and I know you're familiar with this, we run a cost savings initiative every year at the company. This year, we called it Velocity that we ran under the same name last year. And we challenge every one of our business units. It's a bottoms-up process to come up with cost savings ideas for how we run our company.And we've had amazing success through that program over the last 10 years. In the last 2 years, in fact, if you look at it, we've been able to identify over $700 million of cost savings initiatives, both at FPL and Energy Resources. So we're constantly looking for ways to continue to take cost out of the business, whether it's O&amp;M, whether it's G&amp;A and how do we leverage technology. Technology is a big piece of it as well.We recently launched a massive generative AI program that we think also leveraging all the skills that we have around technology that we've been able to build over the last 10 to 15 years to really leverage AI in a way we never have in terms of how we run the business as well. And so all of those things, I think, are going to contribute to cost declines over time for the business. But we're laser-focused on cost.And then the development business, when you're selling a commodity, electricity, it's a game of inches, you got to be better than the next developer in line in terms of buying equipment cheaper, building it cheaper, operating it cheaper, financing it cheaper and we have with the A- balance sheet, a terrific cost of capital advantage. And when we put all those things together, we feel great about our competitive position, our market share and how we continue to progress through our renewable development program.OperatorOur next question -- pardon me, this concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

The total value issued in global equity deals rose from the prior quarter for the first time in more than a year, but the issuance level was about 2x lower than the quarterly average during 2021. The total global value of announced M&amp;A also ticked up quarter over quarter, but even with the growth, the second quarter was reminiscent of the lows reached during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.Global equity issuance activity since Q2 2021The headwinds facing dealmaking for much of the last six quarters are expected to continue plaguing transaction activity in the second half of 2023. Geopolitical unrest, rising rates and economic growth concerns are all giving companies pause before pursuing transactions.""The lack of equity issuance and M&amp;A announcements since the early part of 2022 has created some pent-up demand,"" said Joe Mantone, lead author of the report. ""It's no surprise that we've seen some pockets of quarter-over-quarter growth, but activity levels are far from normal. Companies and investors should gain more clarity over the direction of interest rates and the economy later this year and once that occurs, markets could become more sanguine and supportive of deal activity.""Key highlights from the quarterly report include:Second-quarter M&amp;A transactions' total value was $564.03 billion, a 42.4% decline from an already low base a year earlier.The total value raised from global equity deals increased 28.8% quarter over quarter to $77.39 billion in the second quarter but remains far below levels reached in 2021 when the quarterly averaged raised topped $260 billion.The total number of global M&amp;A announcements in 2023 hit a monthly low in June with just 3,044 transactions.Story continuesThe quarterly report provides an overview of global M&amp;A and equity issuance trends, offering insights into the sectors and geographies that are seeing the most activity. It also focuses on deals with the highest valuations and strategies larger players pursue that underscore trends occurring throughout an industry.

174,e676778f-ebb5-3c9b-8c7b-1a1c39fc2b0a,SPGI,2023-07-26,S&P Global Mobility Shares July US Auto Inventory Trends,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/p-global-mobility-shares-july-191100989.html,1690312260,STORY,['SPGI'],"[The impact of the July 4 weekend sales events, Ford Mach-E inventory numbers climbing past ICE SUVs, and the looming Compact SUV dogfight in the US market. SOUTHFIELD, Mich., July 25, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Dealer advertised inventories in the US took an expected dip following the July 4 weekend, but have quickly recovered, according to new analysis from S&amp;P Global Mobility.And while July 4 sales events received their typical promotions, the pattern for the long weekend was consistent to recent months-end in terms of sold inventory. The July 4 weekend also represented a trifecta of the end of the month, end of the quarter, and a holiday.But while the long weekend took a chunk out of available advertised inventories – from 1.843 million in mid-June to 1.761 million on July 3, perhaps more notable is that available inventories almost immediately leaped ahead to 1.867 million by mid-July, surpassing the year-to-date highs seen in mid-June.Total Industry Advertised Inventories | As of 16 July 2023 | Source: S&amp;P Global Mobility | © S&amp;P Global MobilityFord Mach-E inventories climbing past ICE SUVs You can tell an automaker is serious about electric vehicles when advertised inventories climb to the equivalent level of its better-selling internal-combustion vehicles.That is now happening with Ford SUVs, as inventories grow for the Ford Mustang Mach-E. In December, the Mach-E had the lowest advertised inventory count of any Ford SUV. As of early July, however, Ford dealers are now advertising more available Mach-E volume (14,363 units) than those of EcoSport, Bronco, Edge, and now, even Escape. Only the Explorer and Bronco Sport have more advertised units available.Whether production is ramping up to meet anticipated demand, or whether there is sufficient demand to reduce inventories, remains to be seen. Year-to-date through June, Ford sold 14,040 units of the Mach-E, according to company reports, although inventories were constrained through the first quarter, and the sales pace has recently accelerated. By contrast, Ford has sold 64,839 Escapes over that period.Story continuesFord SUV Advertised Inventories | As of 16 July 2023 | Source: S&amp;P Global Mobility | © S&amp;P Global MobilityNon-Tesla EV inventories plateauing? While Mach-E inventories are surging, most other EVs appear to be growing as well, but not at the same rate. Total advertised EV inventories reached 108,000 units in early July, up about 10,000 units from early June.The other mainstream EV chasing volume is the Volkswagen ID.4; with about 12,000 units of advertised inventory (VW sold 6,690 units in 2Q 2023, but, again, with constrained inventories). The third-most advertised inventory is from the Hyundai Ioniq 5, although after an early-year surge of inventory through April, advertised stock appears to have flattened into a predictable wavelet pattern. The Kia EV6 shows a similar trend to the Hyundai – albeit at much lower volumes. The only EV showing a significant tapering of inventories is the Volvo C40.Geographically, most of the industry EV inventory resides in the following DMAs: Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York City, Seattle, and Washington DC.EV Inventories by Nameplate | As of 16 July 2023 | Source: S&amp;P Global Mobility | © S&amp;P Global MobilityEV inventories passing Hybrids? A true measure of EV penetration is comparing advertised inventory volumes against Hybrid Gas-Electric vehicles.Nationally, even as inventories of all vehicles have grown, there has been a consistent gap of about 35,000 to 40,000 units of Hybrids compared to EVs – as of inventory levels on July 10 there were 148,761 Hybrids to 107,514 EVs. However, California saw a landmark event in May, as EV advertised inventories passed Hybrids, and have held steady: 30,914 EVs compared to 27,316 Hybrids as of July 10. Early-July numbers show a sharp spike in growth of Hybrid inventories both nationally and in California – although whether that is a result of consumers choosing EVs over Hybrids, or an uptick in new Hybrid production to meet anticipated demand, has yet to be determined.Hybrid Gas-Electric vs EV Advertised Inventories, National | As of 16 July 2023 | Source: S&amp;P Global Mobility | © S&amp;P Global Mobility Hybrid Gas-Electric vs EV Inventories, California | As of 16 July 2023 | Source: S&amp;P Global Mobility | © S&amp;P Global MobilityToyota rejoins the Compact SUV fight  The most competitive segment in the industry involves mainstream Compact SUVs, and a dogfight looks to be emerging through the summer months as the traditional sales leader appears to have regained its inventory footing.The Toyota RAV4 has been the best-selling passenger vehicle in the US since 2017. But pandemic-related supplier shortages crunched Toyota inventories, resulting in a 6.9% year-over-year sales decline for RAV4 through June.As recently as April, Toyota had fewer RAV4s on the ground compared to Jeep Wrangler, Nissan Rogue, and Mazda CX-5. That tide is now turning, as RAV4 inventories have soared in late June and early July – just in time for the summer selling season – now reaching nearly 40,000 advertised units. Meanwhile, the RAV4's closest rival, the Honda CR-V, saw inventories dip sharply below 15,000 units in late June before seeing a slight jump in early July.Compact SUV Inventories | As of 16 July 2023 | Source: S&amp;P Global Mobility | © S&amp;P Global MobilityAbout S&amp;P Global MobilityAt S&amp;P Global Mobility, we provide invaluable insights derived from unmatched automotive data, enabling our customers to anticipate change and make decisions with conviction.

Data released today for May 2023 show all 20 major metro markets reported month-over-month price increases for the third straight month. More than 27 years of history are available for the data series and can be accessed in full by going to www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/index-family/indicators/sp-corelogic-case-shiller.YEAR-OVER-YEARThe S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, covering all nine U.S. census divisions, reported a -0.5% annual decrease in May, down from a loss of -0.1% in the previous month. The 10-City Composite showed a decrease of -1.0%, which is a tick up from the -1.1% decrease in the previous month. The 20-City Composite posted a -1.7% year-over-year loss, same as in the previous month.Chicago, Cleveland, and New York reported the highest year-over-year gains among the 20 cities in May. Chicago moved up one to the top spot with a 4.6% year-over-year price increase, while Cleveland came in at number two with a 3.9% increase, and New York entered the top three in third with a 3.5% increase. There was an even split of 10 cities reporting lower prices and those reporting higher prices in the year ending May 2023 versus the year ending April 2023.MONTH-OVER-MONTHBefore seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a 1.2% month-over-month increase in May, while the 10-City and 20-City Composites both posted increases of 1.5%.After seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a month-over-month increase of 0.7%, while the 10-City Composite gained 1.1% and 20-City Composites posted an increase of 1.0%.ANALYSIS""The rally in U.S. home prices continued in May 2023,"" says Craig J. Lazzara, Managing Director at S&amp;P DJI. ""Our National Composite rose by 1.2% in May, and now stands only 1.0% below its June 2022 peak. The 10- and 20-City Composites also rose in May, in both cases by 1.5%.Story continues""The ongoing recovery in home prices is broadly based. Before seasonal adjustment, prices rose in all 20 cities in May (as they had also done in March and April). Seasonally adjusted data showed rising prices in 19 cities in May, repeating April's performance. (The outlier is Phoenix, down 0.1% in both months.) On a trailing 12-month basis, the National Composite is 0.5% below its May 2022 level, with the 10- and 20-City Composites also negative on a year-over-year basis.""Regional differences continue to be striking. This month's league table shows the Revenge of the Rust Belt, as Chicago (+4.6%), Cleveland (+3.9%), and New York (+3.5%) were the top performers. If this seems like an unusual occurrence to you, it seems that way to me too. It's been five years to the month since a cold-weather city held the top spot (and that was Seattle, which isn't all that cold). Since May 2018, the top-ranked cities have been Las Vegas (12 months), Phoenix (33 months), Tampa (5 months), and Miami (9 months).""At the other end of the scale, the worst performers continue to cluster near the Pacific coast, with Seattle (-11.3%) and San Francisco (-11.0%) at the bottom. This month the Midwest (+2.7%) unseated the Southeast (+2.1%) as the country's strongest region. The West (-6.9%) remains weakest.""Home prices in the U.S. began to fall after June 2022, and May's data bolster the case that the final month of the decline was January 2023. Granted, the last four months' price gains could be truncated by increases in mortgage rates or by general economic weakness. But the breadth and strength of May's report are consistent with an optimistic view of future months.""SUPPORTING DATATable 1 below shows the housing boom/bust peaks and troughs for the three composites along with the current levels and percentage changes from the peaks and troughs.2006 Peak2012 TroughCurrentIndexLevelDateLevelDateFrom Peak(%)LevelFrom Trough(%)From Peak(%)National184.61Jul-06134.00Feb-12-27.4 %305.15127.7 %65.3 %20-City206.52Jul-06134.07Mar-12-35.1 %312.02132.7 %51.1 %10-City226.29Jun-06146.45Mar-12-35.3 %325.72122.4 %43.9 %Table 2 below summarizes the results for May 2023.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. ETFs recently featured in the blog include: VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF FTXL and Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Semiconductor ETFs in Focus Ahead of Q2 EarningsSemiconductor stocks and ETFs have been rising this year buoyed by the artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF, iShares Semiconductor ETF, First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF and Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF have gained 22.6%, 21.8%, 17.6% and 21.9%, respectively, over the past three months.The strong trend is likely to continue in the weeks ahead as the Q2 earnings season picks up pace (read: Best &amp; Worst ETF Areas of First Half 2023).Semiconductors have been the most important drivers of the overall growth in technology, given the use of chips in day-to-day life, from cars to electronic gadgets to planes and weapons. Demand will continue to trend higher, given increased digitization in various corners like healthcare, transport, financial systems, defense, agriculture and retail, among others.The rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology like cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, AI, cryptocurrencies, 5G and other advanced information technologies should continue to fuel growth. Further, the introduction of expensive and new-generation chips has led to an enhancement in the product mix for semiconductors.Some well-known players in the space, such as Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), will report earnings in the coming days. Let’s delve into the financial picture of the companies that have a higher allocation in the above-mentioned ETFs and the power they have to move the funds up or down as Q2 earnings unfold. SMH is largely concentrated on these four firms with a combined share of 33.5%, followed by 27.5% for SOXQ, 26.1% for SOXX and 22% for FTXL.Story continuesPer our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Inside Our Earnings PredictionIntel has an Earnings ESP of +19.64% and a Zacks Rank #2. The stock saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Intel delivered an earnings surprise of 10.1%, on average, for the preceding four quarters. It is slated to release earnings after market close on Jul 27.Qualcomm has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company witnessed no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter and delivered an earnings surprise of 1.05% in the trailing four quarters, on average. The company is slated to report earnings after the closing bell on Aug 2 (see: all the Technology ETFs here).NVIDIA has an Earnings ESP of +5.56% and a Zacks Rank #1. It saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past 30 days for the quarter to be reported. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 0.26%, on average, over the past four quarters. Nvidia is slated to report on Aug 23 (read: Nasdaq-100 Rebalance: What ETF Investors Should Know).Advanced Micro Devices has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. Its earnings surprise history is impressive, with the average beat being 15.53% for the preceding four quarters. The stock witnessed no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the quarter to be reported. AMD is slated to report earnings on Aug 1 after the closing bell.ConclusionThough most companies are expected to surprise on earnings this season, semiconductor ETFs might see smooth trading in the weeks ahead as SOXX, SMH and FTXL have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 or 2. This suggests their outperformance in the weeks ahead.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.Get it free &gt;&gt;Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

(Operator Instructions) Please also note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ken Levy, Vice President, Investor Relations.Kenneth B. LevyThanks, Joe. Good morning, and welcome to Iridium's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call this morning are our CEO, Matt Desch; and our CFO, Tom Fitzpatrick. Today's call will begin with a discussion of our second quarter results followed by Q&amp;A. I trust you've had an opportunity to review this morning's earnings release, which is available on the Investor Relations section of Iridium's website. Before I turn things over to Matt, I'd like to caution all participants that our call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical fact and include statements about our future expectations, plans and prospects. Such forward-looking statements are based upon our current beliefs and expectations and are subject to risks, which could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements. Such risks are more fully discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our remarks today should be considered in light of such risks. Any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of today, and while we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our views or expectations change. During the call, we'll also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including operational EBITDA, pro forma free cash flow, free cash flow yield and free cash flow conversion. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Please refer to today's earnings release in the Investor Relations section of our website for further explanation of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. With that, let me turn things over to Matt.Story continuesMatthew DeschThanks again. Good morning, everyone. It was another good quarter. We again posted double-digit revenue growth and record operational EBITDA. Interest in Iridium's unique network services is broad-based, running from commercial and industrial customers through to consumer products, and we continue to see tailwinds from our expanding and strategic R&amp;D and network development work for the U.S. government. Since our last call, we were happy to add 5 more spare satellites to our network, which increases our network's resilience. These were existing ground spares that were built as part of the original Iridium NEXT mission and we launched them in May on a rideshare with OneWeb. They've all checked out now in space, and our ops team is moving them to position each optimally across our 6 orbital planes. Though our operational constellation is young and very healthy, I'm glad we took this cost-effective opportunity to get these assets into the sky rather than keep them in storage on the ground. They give us a total of 14 on-orbit spares to enhance the redundancy of our network for years to come. We haven't needed to use any of our spares yet. The primary 66 satellites are not only operating well, but they're performing even better than our original engineering models and statistical expectations, which is also why we're so confident about our extended CapEx holiday. The quality and resilience of Iridium's network remains a strength and continues to be a strong selling point to partners and their customers. This fact and our best-in-class coverage have really differentiated Iridium in the market and made our brands synonymous with reliability, safety and performance. Many of you may also be aware that Iridium made its second quarterly dividend payment on June 30. We expect to return about $65 million to shareholders in 2023 through this program and also expect to complete the full outstanding share repurchase authorization. In general, I'm very happy with Iridium's performance and execution this year. We are growing our top line nicely, executing well on operations and innovation and returning capital to our shareholders. All of this is happening as we prosecute on a growing number of opportunities in the L-band mobile satellite services sector and remain true to what I've often called our lane and identity. There's a lot of disruption underway in our industry caused by the new broadband players, and I'm glad that we're not part of that. We also don't believe that any of the merger activity in the industry, like the recent ViaSat-Inmarsat closing impacts our business. Actually has probably been a net benefit to us ever since the deal was first announced in 2021. Iridium is unlike any other satellite company in the industry today that's because we've largely avoided the (inaudible) of delivering commodity services and speeds to instead focus on the niche services that we do better than any other companies in the industry. Our commitment to invest in our unique network architecture and service focus has continued to pay dividends literally. Iridium is very well positioned to capitalize on new demand for L-band services in the commercial sector. Many of the opportunities that I've spoken to over the past 12 months are now taking shape and could add to Iridium's already strong revenue growth and drive additional new users onto our network. A good example of one of these is Iridium Certus 100. You will recall this mid-band service, as we call it, delivers a data connection that is about 35x faster than our legacy narrowband offering. But still uses low power and requires a very small antenna. The service is perfect for applications where size, weight and power are considerations. Like for the new uncrewed aerial vehicle market, or for connectivity to smaller aircraft or helicopters, the service has been adopted by many of our partners and some of the first applications are now available in market, including our new Iridium GO! exec, which is getting good early traction. We expect the new opportunities that our mid-band service creates will help increase ARPUs over time. I'm quite excited specifically about the UAV or drone opportunity. I haven't mentioned it much on past calls because the market was so early in development, but we see a lot of momentum underway recently from all the drone companies we've attracted to be partners. They plan to use Iridium in their command and control architecture. Some of you may have even seen that we recently put out a very innovative white paper on that topic. It introduces an approach and justification for using satellite networks for beyond visual line of sight controller drones or BVLOS, as it's often referred to. The feedback we received over the past few weeks from that paper has been incredible, and it's attracted even more partner interest in industry discussion. BVLOS has been a real issue that needs to be overcome for the growth and long-term success of using drones for industrial applications. The solution proposed in our white paper would enhance situational awareness and safety for remotely piloted UAVs. This study was made with a consortium of partners and has generated a lot of interest from drone operators and regulators who are all seeking to more effectively and safely commercialize the use of UAVs in the nation's airspace. This is a fast-growing industry, and we think Iridium is well positioned with its Iridium Certus 100 services to support the long-term growth and operation of these aircraft. Another early example of the utility of Iridium's mid-band services comes from partners like SKYTRAC who are leveraging our network to support real-time messaging in fixed wing and rotorcraft and even in-flight payment verification for smaller airliners. These services have already gained a lot of industry attention and are being positioned for deployment on narrow-body aircraft run by low-cost carriers. Leaning further into aviation, I'm also very excited about the progress of our partner, Honeywell and Collins on their respective Iridium Certus broadband terminals. They've already announced some big customers like Bombardier and Dassault, who will line fit this new equipment on some of their business jet models which should allow service revenues to start in 2024. These aviation services are incremental to our existing broadband revenues coming from maritime and land/mobile and are just in time for the backlog of commercial aircraft orders expected in the coming years. Overall, our broadband subs grew at 14% during the second quarter helping us pass 10,000 commercial subscribers using our Iridium Certus platform. This is a great milestone to reach since we introduced our broadband services in the maritime and land/mobile industries about 4 years ago and only recently expanded our Iridium Certus offerings. We continue to take market share in the industry, and our momentum in broadband has remained strong as our partner ecosystem has broadened, and they've experienced our competitive advantage. Next, I want to highlight our emerging opportunity in direct-to-device. We think this offering is a great way to leverage our satellite network and expand into more consumer applications as well as into a variety of new industries, starting with Android smartphones using Qualcomm Snapdragon processors. We see a lot of opportunity here and are awaiting adoption and service introductions as I'm sure you are. The evolving market for satellite connectivity to smartphones is potentially very large. But to really achieve the big number some analysts are talking about could take a long time, probably 10 to 15 years when you factor in the need for many players to build and launch new satellites and get global regulatory approvals to achieve the full promise of D2D. We believe the near to midterm opportunities in SOS, like the service being pioneered by Apple with the iPhone 14 and that we plan to support for the Android ecosystem. Our service also provides for real-time messaging, and I expect Apple will eventually too. The good news for customers with Iridium technology inside is that our solutions will have our trademark reliability and superior global coverage. I don't have any more news for you today on our D2D rollout. We've completed our qualification work with Qualcomm, but know there's development and integration work required for these smartphone OEMs that adopt this new satellite technology. We don't have very good visibility in the timing or volume of specific smartphones. But from what we do know, we now expect the first activations will move into 2024. Specific information on what products and their specific timing will all come from Qualcomm and their smartphone customers in due time. Our full year guidance continues to assume that direct-to-device will not be material to our service revenue in 2023. We believe that Iridium's network is ideal for differentiating smartphones using our service by providing a reliable, valuable SOS and messaging capability that is truly global and that users will appreciate. Longer term, we're also excited about the potential Qualcomm provides us in a number of other markets beyond smartphones. The initial development work we've done with Qualcomm on the smartphone capability can be readily tracked on our income statement. You can see it flow through the commercial portion of our engineering and support revenue. As I said, we expect that it will take time for direct-to-device services to be adopted and generate meaningful revenue, but it is clear even from the current limited reach of the iPhone 14 that SOS services on smartphones do save lives, and that's something we want to be part of.Lastly, I want to highlight Iridium's work with the U.S. government. You're no doubt aware of our fixed-price EMSS contract with the DoD but it is our expanding strategic relationship with the government that is our long-term focus and real opportunity. The Space Development Agency selection of Iridium, along with our partner, General Dynamics, to build the ground network and operate their next-generation network is a testament to Iridium's experience and strong relationship we've cultivated with the government to decades of collaboration. Work on this 7-year contract is largely responsible for our record engineering and support revenue over the past year and it should continue to drive new revenue through the end of the decade. Working with FTA on this contract will also help expand our core expertise in the technologies for our own future next-generation network. These are but a few of the projects on which we've been working that are now coming to fruition. Tom will share details on our financial performance from the quarter, but I think you can see that we're making good progress, continue to be well positioned and are focused on longer-term growth opportunities. Even in Iridium's core sat phone business, which is largely driven by traditional voice and data services, we're experiencing strong demand. We are a leader in voice and data services and with our traditional core businesses growing well and strong opportunities in the newer business lines I previewed today, we are confident in our forecast of high single-digit service revenue growth on average through 2025. We see lots of new opportunities after 2025 as well, some of which we will unpack during our Investor Day on September 21. For this event, we'll be focusing on our growth plans and cash generation through 2030 based upon the efforts underway with partners today and those that we anticipate in the coming years. We have an exciting long-term vision, which we look forward to sharing with you. We take great pride in the way our business is performing and our ability to add new partners and create new network functionality to drive their growth and support our free cash flow. Like our past, our future is based on continued strong execution and staying in our unique lane. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom, for a review of our financials and I look forward to your questions, thanks. Tom?Thomas FitzpatrickThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll get started by summarizing our key financial metrics for the quarter and providing some color on the trends we're seeing in our business lines. Then I'll recap the 2023 guidance, which we affirmed this morning and close with a review of the liquidity position and capital structure. Iridium continued to execute well in the second quarter generating total revenue of $193.1 million, up 10% from the prior year's quarter. The improvement reflects ongoing growth in our commercial business lines and continued strength in engineering and support and subscriber equipment. Operational EBITDA hit a record $115.8 million in the second quarter. This was up 9% from the prior year's quarter and was driven by strength across all commercial business lines and engineering and support revenue.On the commercial side of our business, service revenue was up 12% this quarter to $118.6 million. Strength was broad-based and reflected continued momentum in voice, IoT and broadband. Commercial voice and data revenue grew $6.5 million or 13% in the second quarter to $55 million. The increase was largely driven by the price changes we implemented earlier this year, our first since 2018. To date, we have been pleased with how the new pricing has been received and expect that voice ARPU this year will remain in the mid-40s. In commercial IoT, we continue to benefit from demand for personal satellite communications. Revenue rose 13% from the prior year quarter to $34.6 million. As we enter our seasonally strong summer period, we continue to see strong consumer demand for personal satellite communication devices. This ongoing trend and the shifting mix of subscribers using lower ARPU plans resulted in IoT ARPU of $7.48 during the quarter. As I've discussed before, we love the service revenue these subscribers generate given the minimal comparative network resources they consume. Commercial IoT subs grew 19% from last year's second quarter. Fueled in part by 77,000 net new additions. This was the fourth strongest in our history. IoT data subscribers now represent 79% of billable commercial subscribers, up from 76% in the year ago period. We estimate that consumer-oriented plans account for about half of our 1.6 million commercial IoT users. Commercial Broadband revenue grew 16% from the year ago period to $14 million. In Maritime, we continue to benefit from new subscriber adoption of Iridium Certus 200 and 700. These new customers predominantly use Iridium as a companion service to VSAT and have higher usage trends than our legacy Iridium OpenPort subscribers. At the same time, we continue to see those OpenPort subscribers upgrading to Iridium Certus for the faster speeds. Maritime remains an important component of our broadband growth. But as Matt detailed, our partners have also made good progress with their respective aviation terminals, and we expect that these will add to our broadband revenue as this equipment is installed on commercial aircraft. Hosting and other data service revenue was $15.1 million this quarter, in line with last year's comparable quarter and consistent with our hosting contracts. Government Service revenue was also steady in the second quarter at $26.5 million, reflecting the terms of our EMSS contract with the U.S. government. Subscriber equipment remained strong at $27.4 million in the second quarter. We continue to believe that hardware sales will remain robust this year and will be in line with '22s level for the full year. Engineering and support revenue was $20.6 million in the second quarter as compared to $8.3 million in the prior year period. The increase reflects ongoing work for the U.S. government related to a space development agency contract that we won last year. We continue to expect engineering revenue will be up significantly this year, but will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based upon execution and milestone achievements. Based upon our results through the second quarter and the trends we're seeing into July, we're reaffirming our full year guidance for service revenue growth between 9% and 11% in 2023. And operational EBITDA between $455 million and $465 million. I'd like to highlight a few items coloring our guidance as they may be relevant to your models and the cadence of Iridium's growth. We continue to expect strong subscriber activations across all our commercial business lines, which will together with price increases in commercial voice and data, drive service revenue growth between 9% and 11% in 2023. This year's outlook continues to support our 3-year expectation that total service revenue growth will average in the high single digits from 2023 through 2025. To put that in context, given that our current year guidance at the midpoint is 10%, our guidance indicates that average growth in 2024 and 2025 is expected to be less than 10%. This is because 2023's growth is being favorably impacted by the price increase in commercial voice and data that occurred earlier this year. This increase is not expected to recur in 2024 or 2025. Our average growth rate guidance of high single digits also includes our best estimate of Qualcomm service revenues over this period. With regard to our EMSS contract with the U.S. government, there is no increase in contractual fees this year. Therefore, quarterly revenue in our government business will remain steady at $26.5 million for the balance of the year. Equipment sales, while a bit off their recent record pace in the quarter, continue to be on track for another strong year in line with 2022. Engineering and support revenue will also grow as we continue contractual work for the Space Development Agency and recognize Qualcomm development revenue this year. On the expense side of the ledger, we continue to forecast higher costs this year related to stock-based compensation and new employee hires as we also retool and upgrade business systems. These dynamics resulted in a 30% increase in SG&amp;A in the second quarter which was down from the first quarter and is expected to moderate further during the second half of the year. We continue to forecast that full year SG&amp;A will be up by about 20% in 2023. As previously guided, R&amp;D will run higher in 2023 as we support a number of new products coming to market, including the new commercial aviation terminals, which Matt highlighted earlier, and new mid-band technology we're developing with partners. In all, we believe the incremental expenses we will incur in 2023 can be comfortably absorbed while still achieving our EBITDA guidance for the year. These expenses as well as our investments in new products and systems are appropriate as our business grows and we prepare to capitalize on a number of new business opportunities. Moving to our capital position as of June 30. Iridium had a cash and cash equivalents balance of $103.5 million. Iridium's growing cash flow has been a source of liquidity and is one of the reasons that our Board continues to support our share repurchase program and initiated a quarterly dividend program. Iridium paid its second quarterly dividend on June 30 and expect this program will return approximately $65 million of cash to common holders in 2023. In the second quarter, we also purchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of about $59.48 for a total of $66.1 million. We have approximately $60 million of capacity outstanding on our share repurchase program, and we'll continue to execute on buybacks, balancing our objective for deleveraging with the desire to maximize return on investment. Iridium's net leverage was 3.1x of EBITDA at the end of the second quarter. This was down from 3.4x a year earlier, even when factoring in our share repurchase and dividend activity during the second quarter. Our target for net leverage continues to be between 2.5 and 3.5x of EBITDA at the end of 2023, inclusive of quarterly dividends and giving effect to all outstanding share buybacks authorized by our Board. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $22.4 million, including onetime spending of approximately $6 million related to May's launch of 5 spare satellites. We continue to expect annual capital expenditures to average $50 million to $60 million over Iridium's forecasted 10-year CapEx holiday period. Excluding launch-related costs, 2023 as capital expenditures should fall in line with this long-term forecast. With the successful launch of 5 of our ground spare satellites and in assessing the overall health and performance of our operational constellation, we also made the operational decision that we would not need to launch the sixth and remaining ground spare we constructed for the Iridium NEXT mission. This determination resulted in our writing off the full value of the satellite by recording accelerated depreciation expense of $37.5 million in the second quarter. Turning to our pro forma free cash flow. If we use the midpoint of our 2023 EBITDA guidance and back off $75 million in net interest, approximately $75 million in CapEx for this year and $14 million in working capital, inclusive of the appropriate hosted payload adjustment, we're projecting pro forma free cash flow of almost $300 million. These metrics represent a conversion rate of EBITDA to free cash flow of 64% in '23 and a yield of approximately 4%. A more detailed description of these cash flow metrics, along with the reconciliation to GAAP measures, is available in the supplemental presentation under Events on our Investor Relations website. In closing, we remain very excited about Iridium's ongoing strength and its many partnerships and prospects for growth. Demand for our L-band services and equipment remains strong, and our business continues to perform well. We are incredibly excited about our future and in a good position to continue to return capital to our shareholders as we fund new projects and make strategic investments. With that, I'll turn things back to the operator for the Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question here will come from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.Richard Hamilton PrentissFirst question on '23 guidance. I appreciate a lot of the color you guys provided. Sometimes by this point in the year, you might have the ability to be taking up guidance given your style. Anything in particular that's causing guidance to remain kind of in the zone? Is it maybe the slower uptick on some of the activations for the direct-to-device? Or is it something else we should be aware of?Matthew DeschCertainly isn't direct-to-device. We never really forecast anything in that for this year. I wouldn't say -- some years, we take guidance up by this time, sometimes we don't. The global macroeconomic situation, the supply chain challenges we experienced over the last year. I mean our business is solidly growing, we feel right now, but it just felt like it wasn't the quarter to reevaluate that any more than where we're at right now and felt reiterating was appropriate. Our goal is always to overachieve and doing that early -- to forecasting that too early in the year isn't necessarily a corporate goal or strategy that we take. So I don't think there's anything in particular, Tom...Thomas FitzpatrickI agree with you, Matt.Richard Hamilton PrentissOkay. I appreciate the extra color. Obviously, we've all been trying to get our hands wrapped around direct-to-device opportunities. So it sounds like we want to understand that it will take some time to get this really getting traction. It sounds like then when you mentioned that your '24 and '25 thoughts are that service revenues will be less than 10%. How should we think about us trying to model in royalties and other items. And when would usage fees kind of exceed royalty fees as we try and put models out there into '24 and '25 before you've given a lot of guidance.Matthew DeschI think it's got to be really challenging to do that right now to model out something that we haven't given you much information on. I'm sorry about that. But frankly, we don't have a whole lot more information on it either. We know we've developed a great capability. We have a solid partner in Qualcomm there. As I said, we don't have a lot of visibility to their sell-through into the work that has to be done with the OEMs to adopt the technology, integrate it in, test it out and deliver their models. And since we don't, it's just very hard for us to be able to tell you a lot more. And I'm sure I wish I could in when the time comes, I take some solace in that this is all upside for us, and we're -- I believe we're very well positioned with -- in the right place, but it's just going to take some time to develop, I think, and we'll have to wait for the announcement to come from those smartphone partners and our smartphone people and Qualcomm about what they're going to do.Richard Hamilton PrentissOkay. And Tom, you mentioned the cost, SG&amp;A, 20% up '23 versus '22. A good chunk of that is stock-based comp. We like to adjust that out. I think that's also adjusted out of your OEBITDA. How much stock comp change should we expect is happening between '22 and '23 of that SG&amp;A line?Thomas FitzpatrickAbout half, I'd say, Ric.Richard Hamilton PrentissOkay. Good. Appreciate it. Stay well, everybody.Thomas FitzpatrickRic, you can -- it's clearly marked out in our EBITDA reconciliation. You can pick it right from there.Richard Hamilton PrentissExactly. I was just thinking on the forecast going forward for the second half.OperatorAnd our next question will come from Chris Quilty of Quilty space.Christopher David QuiltyTom, what's up with the inventory. It looks like you have a big slug of finished goods in there.Thomas FitzpatrickRight? So we invest in safety stock. We're a believer in our satellite phone business. And if you see how our business performed versus our competitors, they -- I think they stocked out, we were the beneficiary of that, and so we're making sure we don't stock out, Chris.Christopher David QuiltyAnything on the big hurricane season?Thomas FitzpatrickI mean just, in general, we don't want to -- we're not -- it makes no sense to stock out and we're not going to.Matthew DeschI think we're getting back to traditional levels. We always had tried to be able to deliver to immediate needs. But the last 2 years, obviously, wasn't able to do that. And so it is a real struggle to even have any inventory whatsoever, and that was challenging for our partners and for our growth. Now -- now that finally be able to build back some safety stock in, it's just smart business for us right now.Christopher David QuiltyGot you. One other Tom question. Are there any remaining SpaceX payments that show up in the CapEx in the back half of the year? Are you done?Thomas FitzpatrickNo, we're done.Christopher David QuiltyOkay. Can you talk about the mid-band products? And specifically, what product categories you think you're going to be launching on first and time frame. We've been kind of waiting for a while for to master those products to roll through different categories.Matthew DeschYes. Well, obviously, it's already started in the land/mobile area because the Iridium GO! Exec is built on mid-band technology. But the ones I mentioned today on the call, in aviation is a particularly good example. The UAV market, helicopters are -- I think you're going to see -- are going to roll out in terms of the tracking of medevac helicopters and the like, you need a small lightweight, low-power device in that kind of area as well. .We're seeing -- I said innovative one is like aircraft payments, a lot of bad credit cards on small- to medium-sized airliners and they like to actually validate them in real time and don't really have the technology or the size to have sort of high-speed service on there. So having a really low-cost device with an antenna that doesn't even need to be on the top of the aircraft would be a positive. We are seeing some (technical difficulty) kind of applications with it as well. But this is the first generation of sort of Certus 100, and we have some additional new transceivers that are going to be available in that area here in the next year as well. There's kind of be purpose-built for things like general aviation and some other applications. And then I think there's maritime applications there as well, and some of those are rolling out, too.Christopher David QuiltySo specific to the aviation market, I mean, you've got a pretty high penetration rate in smaller aircraft. Does that mean that most of this, you'll have to have customers upgrade? Or do you see a pretty good new install market?Matthew DeschYes. I think it's going to be -- a lot of it is going to be new install. It's a purpose-built kind of technology that goes into new aircraft panels to provide higher-speed services, better weather, better interaction with air traffic control and all that sort of thing. And so the activities we see from a number of those partners are really going into a lot of new aircrafts, small to midsize. You see some of the -- well, yes, I think that's the best way to look at it. And then as I said, we're just seeing an awful lot of activity in the drone space. We have a lot of partners right now who are using in their early activities. And I think when that business starts to take off, I would call industrial IoT, I suppose, would that be, but it has an aviation component here to it. You will -- I think you'll see us extremely well positioned for that, too.Christopher David QuiltyGot you. And final question, I'll use it on Aviation, also I think you talked about the approval for safety services, and that's distinct from your mass market sort of cockpit safety communications. Are you still in the process of getting the FAA certification for that? And when do you expect it?Matthew DeschYes. That's -- we're well into the middle of that right now. The program is going really well. We call it our Certus aviation safety program or CASP. It's one of our many R&amp;D projects this year that is well underway and sort of is in the later stages of it. It takes some time, but I think it's within the next 12 months or so. I think we're expecting to kind of complete that program and get the certifications that will allow those products -- some of those products that you've seen introduced already by the Honeywells and Collins and SKYTRAC et cetera, be upgraded to cast versions of those, which will allow safety services as well as general communications. So yes, it's an important one for us because, again, it's a unique one that only we can supply on a global basis.OperatorOur next question will come from Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial.Hamed KhorsandJust a follow up on the inventory question. Is this any related to your equipment revenue declining, your partners destocking anyway? Or is this more that you're just trying to stay ahead of the demand.Thomas FitzpatrickWe want to stay ahead of the demand. It's highly profitable revenues, and we want to avoid a stock out. It has nothing to do with the year-over-year -- it's kind of a quarterly performance, we're reiterating that we think equipment revenues will be in line with 2022, which was a record year.Hamed KhorsandAnd then on the consumer side, is there a interest to raise prices there on the IoT service?Matthew DeschNo, I don't think so. I think we're competitive and we see a dynamic market with a number of partners in that space, and they are expanding their product lines and see a lot of potential there. So I don't know that that's like a target really for us to do something really specific that way. I mean we are always looking to adjust our portfolio of pricing in that kind of normal course of events, but I wouldn't call it like raising prices on personal communications.OperatorAnd our next question will come from Mathieu Robilliard with Barclays.Mathieu RobilliardIf I could follow up first on the equipment revenue question, could you give us a bit of color as to why there was this variation in Q2? I realize it's very hard to predict. But still, if you had any color as to why it declined this quarter, it would be great.Matthew DeschI think it's -- I think you could probably say it's more of a year-over-year comparison to a really strong second quarter of last year. I mean I think we were getting unbelievable demand that we were struggling to meet with absolutely no inventory last year and hand to mouth. This year, I think that -- I think we see an overall demand level, as we said, is similar to last year's record levels, but it just -- we probably did really, really well in the first quarter and fourth quarter of last year and expect to see that just a slight sort of downturn in comparison from a quarter-over-quarter this year, but I don't really think that it means anything. I think just as you started out it's really hard to predict exactly what quarter will do on a quarter-by-quarter basis.Mathieu RobilliardFair enough. And second question was on the -- I think you mentioned the drone opportunity to put equipment in drones. Any sense of what kind of market potential that could represent? I mean I guess it's early days, but what kind of number of drones may we be speaking about in terms of potential TAM?Matthew DeschWell, I mean, there's a whole industry that's developing right now. And as I said, it's everything from replacing and automating a lot of work activities that people do that are difficult like monitoring oil and gas wells or monitoring oil rigs, and that's things that perhaps helicopters might have been used for, that drones might be able to do more safely, quickly and cheaply.There's obviously package delivery. I don't know that it's going to be dropping a 6-pack of beer to our front door anytime soon, but there's an awful lot of industrial applications there that we've started to see where everything from medicine delivery to areas that are remote that have to get samples back and forth and that sort of thing. And there's just a lot of companies right now going after that space. I was mentioning one of the big issues for that is that today, you have to control those drones from the ground via line of sight. So if you really want to do something, you have to be able to see it, and if you're doing that, you might as well just use a direct line of sight technology between the controller and the drone. And if it even goes a little further, you might -- you sell your technology. But that isn't really -- the market is not going to grow on that basis. It really needs beyond visual line of sight capability so that drones can go long distances and they'll need to know where they are at all times, and they'll need to know whether they were successful in the mission that they had, et cetera, and you need a small lightweight radio that can connect to it no matter what, and that's what we do. So that's where a lot of the energy has been around. I think the numbers are going to still be small for the next year or 2, but I think there's a lot of hope in the industry that, that will ramp up quite quickly, particularly as some of these regulations are worked out. And that's why we were focused on that paper and why there's an awful lot of interest in regulators and talking to us about that because they want to solve that problem, too.Mathieu RobilliardThat's very helpful. And then last 1 for me. In terms of the Qualcomm contribution today in your revenues, if I understand correctly that at the moment, it's in engineering and support. Can you give us a little bit of color as what is the magnitude of that currently? And how long that will last? Because I understand that at some point, you move to the next phase, the royalties and the service revenues, and this is a finite life, the engineering and development ones.Thomas FitzpatrickSo yes, it's development fees from Qualcomm, and I would characterize it in the area of $5 million to $10 million in the full year.OperatorOur next question will come from Louie DiPalma with William Blair.Michael Louie D DiPalmaMatt, Tom and Ken. First on Aireon. International airline traffic is rebounding in a big way. What needs to happen for Aireon to pay the remaining money that it owes Iridium?Thomas FitzpatrickThat's caught up in a refinancing, Louie, that they intend to do, but that's in our estimation a couple of years out.Michael Louie D DiPalmaOkay. Great. And for Matt, you previously discussed the plans for multimedia personal (technical difficulty) consumer handheld devices potentially for next year? I think research and development expenses are elevated this year on preparations for those devices. Are those devices still on track for next year?Matthew DeschYes. That's worked with partners as well as kind of the work we're doing ourselves on taking that Certus technology and creating basically a next-generation IoT capability that's much more flexible and fast and easy to deploy. That technology is going to go into IoT devices in general, but into personal communications devices specifically and will support things like picture transfer and richer data sort of flows and that sort of thing into, I think, new personal communication products that could hit the market as early as next year. So yes, it's on track, going very well. We're excited about the potential it has for the future. And I think the user experience that people have when they use those personal communication devices.Michael Louie D DiPalmaGreat. And there's been a lot of discussion about providing Iridium connectivity for drones. Is there also applicability to provide Iridium connectivity for the eVTOL market as that emerges in the United States?Matthew DeschYes. We're already doing work with, I know 1 partner. I won't mention who they are, but they're actually doing quite what I would call, large autonomous aircraft today and have expectations for moving to the eVTOL space. That whole new uncrewed air mobility market, eVTOL is exciting. I think it's taking a long time to kind of develop for lots of different reasons, both the technology and the standards and the regulatory bit, I think, it's going to have the same expectations, particularly as it moves to autonomous sort of capabilities. I think the early ones are going to be all probably crude. But eventually, the desire in that industry is to move to autonomy. And you need connectivity to those aircraft, and they're not real big and they have rotors on them. So again, a perfect fit for someone like Iridium's network given our size, weight and power type of our transceivers. So it's still early days for those. I've had some discussions with them. They all express interest, but they seem to be more focused on certification of their platforms today than connectivity of them because that's more of an implementation into the user, into the national airspace.Michael Louie D DiPalmaAnd one last one for Tom. Regarding SG&amp;A, is the 20% increase for this year unusual relative to your long-term view?Thomas FitzpatrickYes, it is. We hired -- as we've said, we hired a lot last year, and you saw our SG&amp;A ramp on the full year last year. And so we have basically easier comps this in the third and fourth quarter, so we're sitting on what like year-to-date, like a 35% increase or something like that, Louie, and we're guiding to 20%. So you're going to see that rate of increase moderate here in the third and fourth quarter to result in a 20% increase on the full year.Matthew DeschYes, we're not going to keep that pace up, Louie. I think there was a little bit of catch-up after we completed Iridium NEXT, and we really kind of focused on, on sort of the capital build out of our program. We've been -- as a result of having a new network, we have this innovation platform that we wanted to exploit and saw -- still see lots and lots of opportunities to do that in a number of different areas and realize we just didn't have the staff in all the places we needed to be able to accomplish that. So we we're filling out doing in marketing and sales as well as in operations and technology and have a lot of -- we think we have a pretty rosy environment going forward that we're going to talk more about in that Investor Day next month.OperatorThat's all our questions today, and we will now conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.Matthew DeschWell, again, thanks for joining us. I look forward to visiting with many of you next -- well, 2 months here on September 21 in New York City. And I think we're going to have a productive session that's focused particularly on sort of our long-term potential opportunities, which we're quite excited about and look forward to talking to you more about that. So thanks for joining.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you very much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

Further, the introduction of expensive and new-generation chips has led to an enhancement in the product mix for semiconductors.Some well-known players in the space, such as Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), will report earnings in the coming days. Let’s delve into the financial picture of the companies that have a higher allocation in the above-mentioned ETFs and the power they have to move the funds up or down as Q2 earnings unfold. SMH is largely concentrated on these four firms with a combined share of 33.5%, followed by 27.5% for SOXQ, 26.1% for SOXX and 22% for FTXL.Per our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Story continuesInside Our Earnings PredictionIntel has an Earnings ESP of +19.64% and a Zacks Rank #2. The stock saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Intel delivered an earnings surprise of 10.1%, on average, for the preceding four quarters. It is slated to release earnings after market close on Jul 27.Qualcomm has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company witnessed no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter and delivered an earnings surprise of 1.05% in the trailing four quarters, on average. The company is slated to report earnings after the closing bell on Aug 2 (see: all the Technology ETFs here).NVIDIA has an Earnings ESP of +5.56% and a Zacks Rank #1. It saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past 30 days for the quarter to be reported. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 0.26%, on average, over the past four quarters. Nvidia is slated to report on Aug 23 (read: Nasdaq-100 Rebalance: What ETF Investors Should Know).Advanced Micro Devices has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. Its earnings surprise history is impressive, with the average beat being 15.53% for the preceding four quarters. The stock witnessed no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the quarter to be reported. AMD is slated to report earnings on Aug 1 after the closing bell.ConclusionThough most companies are expected to surprise on earnings this season, semiconductor ETFs might see smooth trading in the weeks ahead as SOXX, SMH and FTXL have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 or 2. This suggests their outperformance in the weeks ahead.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

SkiftHopper isn’t changing its fintech strategy after Expedia Group’s public break-up with it.Expedia claimed that some of Hopper’s fintech products allegedly have an anti-consumer bent, but the Hopper app still lists its five major, fee-based features: price freeze for air, car and hotel; change for any reason for flights; cancel for any reason for flights and hotels; a flight disruption guarantee; and leave for any reason for hotels.“We stand behind our products and will not be issuing further comments at this time,” a Hopper spokesperson said, responding to a Skift inquiry about how Hopper is coping since Expedia cut off supply of hotel and vacation rentals. “There is value in our fintech products that both consumers and the industry recognize, as exemplified by Hopper’s recognition in the 2022 Skift IDEA Awards.”CapitalOne Travel, which is a Hopper investor and its largest distribution partner, has gone silent about any adverse impact from the Expedia inventory withdrawal, referring all questions about their partnership to Hopper.Meanwhile, Hopper has been running a 30% discount on hotel stays in destinations such as Lima, Peru; Panama City, Panama; and Miami, Florida through a flash sale, although the move isn’t necessarily unusual.And CapitalOne Shopping has been handing out 18% cash back on bookings for properties such as the JW Marriott Miami, The LaSalle Chicago, Autograph Collection, Hyatt Centric The Loop in Chicago, and the Oak Hotel in San Francisco, for example.Hopper Content CreatorsIn furthering its social media strategy, Hopper is running a Hopper Content Creator beta, where consumers would be able to upload videos, photos and audio pertaining to their travels, and would receive Carrot Cash, which is Hopper’s rewards currency, or vouchers toward future travel.Skift is first to report about the Hopper Content Creator test, and a Hopper spokesperson said there’s no timeline for a full launch as the company evaluates the product-market fit.Story continuesWe’ve talked to a lot of short-term rental and online travel industry people and analysts about the implications of the Hopper-Expedia split, and the consensus seems to be that Hopper likely is feeling some momentary hurt, but has a number of direct relationships with well-performing hotels, and the means to recoup other now-absent hotels from a variety of sources.On the vacation rental side of the ledger, it isn’t known whether Hopper was receiving all of Expedia’s Vrbo inventory — some of which is unique to Vrbo — while Expedia was tweaking the Expedia-Vrbo-Hotels.com tech stack or whether Hopper was mostly receiving more easy to replicate vacation rental listings from Expedia.com.At any rate, Hopper is not a major player yet in vacation rentals, and industry players aren’t seeing any major changes in booking momentum because of the Expedia partnership ending.Competitive Factors in the Expedia-Hopper Partnership ExitRichard Clarke, managing director of AB Bernstein, said the development calls into question the viability of such business to business distribution partnerships with competitors.Perhaps one of the pressures for Expedia in the Hopper relationship is that Expedia Group has deals with Marriott and IHG to help identify and police instances where platforms are undercutting their rates, Clarke pointed out. Hopper funds some of of its hotel rate cuts through its high-margin fintech program.Clarke added that Expedia might have been stung by the fact that it was Hopper that recently secured a travel partnership with Uber. “I do wonder how much of this is a reaction to Hopper getting the b2b deal that everyone thought was an Expedia slam dunk,” Clarke said.Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi is a former longtime CEO of Expedia Group, and still an Expedia board member.Expedia has said in the past that it walked away from an Uber deal because the economics didn’t make sense to the company.Henry Harteveldt of Atmosphere Research Group argued that Hopper may be the party to come out of this tussle with the “upper hand” against Expedia, which would feel the pinch of losing the third largest U.S. online travel agency as a customer.Expedia, however, isn’t expected to feel a material impact from the end of the partnership. Or it didn’t file a notice with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to that effect.Meanwhile, on Tuesday afternoon Expedia Group announced a new distribution relationship to power travel for Walmart. Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

CNHI.Buy 5 Stocks with High ROE as Markets Rally on Solid EarningsThe U.S. equity markets witnessed a short-term rally for 11 days on the trot – the longest winning streak since February 2017 – buoyed by a solid earnings performance from hitherto reported companies. The better-than-expected corporate earnings driven by broad-based growth across sectors allayed the fears of a recession in the near term and instilled optimism.The stock market rally was also perhaps driven by the Federal Reserve’s decision to hit a pause button for the rate hike program owing to a slowdown in inflation and maintain a benchmark interest rate in the range of 5-5.25%. However, the minutes from the Jun 13-14 Fed meeting revealed that more rate hikes are in the cards to bring inflation close to the targeted 2% level.The focus has now shifted to the Fed’s Jul 25-26 policy meeting, which is likely to be another potential market catalyst. Investors widely expect a quarter percentage point hike in the interest rates at the conclusion of this meeting. With about 30% of the blue-chip S&amp;P 500 stocks slated to report earnings this week, investors are likely to look for cues about the broader economy and the trajectory of future interest rate hikes.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. AutoNation, Inc., Suzano S.A., Lockheed Martin Corp., Nexstar Media Group, Inc. and CNH Industrial N.V. are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Story continuesWhy ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better.

In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screen:AutoNation: Incorporated in Delaware in 1991, AutoNation is the largest automotive retailer in the United States.

(NYSE:PHM)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-pultegroup-inc-103846987.html,1690367926,STORY,['PHM'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for PulteGroup is US$77.11 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityPulteGroup's US$83.42 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Analyst price target for PHM is US$83.25, which is 8.0% above our fair value estimateHow far off is PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for PulteGroup The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.72bUS$1.54bUS$1.44bUS$1.38bUS$1.35bUS$1.34bUS$1.34bUS$1.35bUS$1.36bUS$1.38bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Est @ -10.34%Est @ -6.61%Est @ -3.99%Est @ -2.16%Est @ -0.88%Est @ 0.02%Est @ 0.65%Est @ 1.08%Est @ 1.39% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.3% US$1.6kUS$1.3kUS$1.1kUS$967US$866US$785US$718US$662US$612US$568(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.1bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.3%– 2.1%) = US$20bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$20b÷ ( 1 + 9.3%)10= US$8.1bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$17b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$83.4, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PulteGroup as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.208. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for PulteGroupStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Consumer Durables market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.And I will now turn the conference over to James Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.James P. ZeumerGood morning, and thank you for joining today's call to discuss PulteGroup's exceptional second quarter operating and financial results. Along with affirming the ongoing desire for homeownership and the strength of overall buyer demand, our second quarter numbers demonstrate the strategic value of PulteGroup's balanced and disciplined approach to the business.Joining me on today's call to discuss our Q2 results are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O’'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Senior VP of Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll post an audio replay of this call later today.I want to inform everyone on today's call that today's discussion includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?Story continuesRyan R. MarshallThanks, James, and good morning. As you read in this morning's press release, Q2 was an outstanding quarter for PulteGroup as we posted strong financial results throughout our P&amp;L, balance sheet and cash flow statement. In fact, our second quarter revenues, gross and operating margins and net income were at or are approaching all-time highs for our second quarter.Our record financial performance in turn drove strong cash flows that helped raise our cash position to $1.8 billion, while dropping our net debt-to-capital ratio to almost 0. I am really proud of our homebuilding and financial services teams for delivering these great results, which are even more impressive given the variable market conditions we've operated in for the past 12 months.Within these complicated market dynamics, I believe PulteGroup's operating and financial success reflects the balanced and disciplined approach we take in running our homebuilding business.We continue to successfully implement both a build-to-order model that serves our move-up and active adult buyers in combination with a spec-based model, primarily within our first-time buyer communities. Our spec production is most heavily weighted toward our Centex branded communities, which operate under a managed spec production model. In other words, homes are started to spec, but we have aligned the starts cadence with our sales pace. Given Centex' focus on serving the needs of first-time buyers, our long-term plan is to maintain a spec build model in these communities.By being more balanced across build-to-order and spec production, we maintain a more consistent cadence of home starts, meet buyer demand more effectively, and we achieved the critical objective of turning our assets in support of higher returns. You can see the practical application of this managed approach in our Q2 numbers that specs totaled 36% of units under production at quarter end. Of these units, we averaged just over one finished spec per community, which is in line with our stated goal.Along with the balance between our build-to-order and spec production, we are appropriately diversified across all the buyer groups consistent with our long-term goal of having 40% first-time, 35% move-up and 25% active adult. Why is this important? The different financial profiles associated with each buyer group can mean different responses to changing market dynamics, such as today's rising rate environment, which may hinder first-time buyers, but be less of a headwind among active adult consumers.Being balanced across build-to-order, spec and buyer groups is also an important underpinning to the extremely high gross margins we've been able to maintain. More directly, we have enough production to meet buyer demand, but not so much that we are no longer selling from a position of strength.I think we've achieved the right mix as we increased orders and closings, all while 2/3 of our divisions were still able to raise prices in the quarter. Along these same lines, we continue to see pricing opportunities within our core build-to-order business that primarily serves our move-up and active adult buyers.In our most recent quarter, options and lot premiums exceeded $100,000 per home. These are high-margin dollars that are not as prevalent among first-time buyers and certainly were an important driver of the strong 29.6% gross margin we reported in Q2. While the market started slowing in 2022, I said that we couldn't be margin proud, but rather we had to find price and turn our assets. Delivering 24% growth in Q2 orders, and as Bob will detail, guiding to margins of 29% or better for the remainder of the year, we are achieving both high margins and high asset turns, which drove our 32% return on equity.Beyond the company's specific benefits we are realizing from how we run our business, we appreciate the favorable supply-demand dynamics resulting from the limited stock of existing houses available for sale. National Association of Realtors' data for June showed seasonally adjusted existing home sales of $4.2 million, which is down a staggering 1 million homes from June of last year.As has been well reported, there are millions of existing homeowners who are sitting on low rate mortgages established before the most recent cycle of Fed rate hikes. I recently saw an FHA graph that showed that more than 50% of current mortgage holders have a rate below 4%. I haven't seen any rate forecast that show the country getting back to 4% mortgages anytime soon. So it's likely that existing homes remain in short supply for the foreseeable future.FHA data, along with mortgage rate forecasts, suggest that there may be an extended period during which mortgage rates stay above 5%, which likely prevents an oversupply of existing homes being released into the market. Through the first 6 months of 2023, we generated $1.3 billion of net income and $1.5 billion of cash flow from operations. As a result, we increased our cash position by almost $700 million while returning almost $500 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. I think these numbers clearly demonstrate the powerful results our company is delivering.With the backlog of $8.2 billion worth of homes to be built, improving cycle times and a solid land supply, we are well positioned to deliver even stronger performance over the remainder of 2023.Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of the quarter. Bob?Robert T. O’ShaughnessyThanks, Ryan, and good morning. Our second quarter numbers speak for themselves in terms of demonstrating the strength of our operations and in turn, overall housing demand to sell just dive right in. Our second quarter home sale revenues totaled $4.1 billion, an increase of 8% over last year. Higher revenues for the quarter were driven by a 5% increase in closings to 7,518 homes in combination with a 3% increase in average sales price to $540,000. Our ability to meet stronger demand in the period with available spec inventory allowed us to slightly exceed our prior closing guidance.For the quarter, our mix of closings was comprised of 41% first-time buyers, 34% move-up buyers and 25% active adult buyers. The breakdown of our business remains in line with our stated targets of 40% first time, 35% move-up and 25% active adult. In the second quarter of last year, our closing mix was 36% first time, 38% move-up and 26% active adult. Our net new orders in the second quarter increased 24% over last year to 7,947 homes. The double-digit increase in our orders benefited from the overall strength of market demand in the period along with our ability to capture this demand through a 14% increase in our average community count to 903 neighborhoods. The strength of consumer demand is also evident in our cancellation rate. Cancellations as a percentage of beginning period backlog was 9% in this quarter, which is down almost 350 basis points on a sequential basis from the first quarter. The 24% increase in our second quarter net new orders reflect an increase in our absorption pace to 2.9 homes per month of 2.7 homes per month last year and resulted in higher net new orders across all buyer groups. In the period, net new orders from first-time buyers increased 28% over the prior year to 3,150 homes. Orders for move-up buyers increased 33%, 2,897 homes and orders from active adult buyers increased 7% to 1,900 homes. The year-over-year increase in first-time buyer orders shows that our homes continue to offer a compelling value and meet the affordability requirements of this buyer group. At the same time, our higher net new orders among move-up and active adult buyers is a positive development and a test to the broad mix strength of housing demand. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect year-over-year community count growth of 5% to 10% in the third and fourth quarters, each as compared to the comparable prior year period. Our backlog at the end of the second quarter was 13,588 homes with a value of $8.2 billion. In the second quarter of last year, our backlog stood at 19,176 homes valued at a record peak of $11.6 billion.We ended the second quarter with a total of 16,740 homes under construction, of which approximately 6,000 or 36% were spec. We continue to closely manage spec production as total specs under construction at quarter end were down 11% from last year. Finished specs are also consistent with our historical carrier rate as we ended the quarter with about 1 finished spec per community. In the second quarter, we started approximately 7,400 homes, which is up 41% compared to the first quarter of this year. Given the strength of PulteGroup's year-to-date orders and deliveries, coupled with the status of our backlog and production universe, we're establishing a full year 2023 delivery target of 29,500 homes. Of this total, we would expect to deliver between 7,000 and 7,400 homes in the third quarter. Our third quarter and full year delivery targets are benefiting from roof of construction cycle times as our operations are realizing meaningful improvements on cycle times at homes they are starting today. Based on the mix of backlog loans we expect to deliver in the third and fourth quarters, coupled with the anticipated spec closings, we are projecting in those periods, we expect the average sales price on third and fourth quarter closings to be approximately $540,000.Turning to margins. Our reported gross margin in the second quarter was 29.6%. The improvement in our margin as compared to our previous guide was due to improved pricing on spec sales and increased closings from our higher-margin markets, each as compared to a prior estimates. In addition, as we discussed on our prior earnings call, our aggregate gross margins are benefiting from our move-up and active adult business where profitability is holding up better. Based on current market dynamics, we expect to maintain this strong margin position throughout the remainder of '23 and expect our gross margin to be in the range of 29.0% to 29.5% in both the third and fourth quarters of this year. As we experienced in the second quarter, the actual weeks of deliveries, both in terms of geography and buyer groups, may impact our reported numbers.Our reported SG&amp;A expense in the second quarter was $315 million or 7.8% of home sale revenues and included a $65 million pretax insurance benefit recorded in the period. In the second quarter of last year, our SG&amp;A expense was $351 million or 9.3% of home sale revenues. Based on our delivery targets for the remainder of the year, we expect SG&amp;A expense to be in the range of 9.0% to 9.5% of home sale revenues in the third quarter in the range of 8% to 8.5% of home sale revenues in the fourth quarter. Second quarter pretax income generated by our financial services operations increased 16% over last year to $46 million. Pricing conditions remain highly competitive in the mortgage industry, but quarterly earnings benefited from improved profitability within our title and insurance operations. Capture rate in the second quarter improved to 80% compared with 78% last year. Our reported tax expense in the second quarter was $233 million or an effective tax rate of 24.4%. We expect our tax rate for the remainder of '23 to be 24.5%. On the bottom line, our reported second quarter net income was a record $740 million or $3.21 per share. This was up from last year's reported net income of $652 million or $2.73 per share. Capitalizing on our outstanding financial results and resulting cash flows, we repurchased 3.7 million common shares in the quarter at a cost of $250 million at an average price of $68.31 per share. Through the first 6 months of '23, we have used $400 million to repurchase 6.4 million shares or 2.8% of our common shares outstanding. We also invested $370 million in land acquisition and $523 million in related development during the quarter. In total, our land sale in the period was $893 million, which is down from $1.1 billion through the second quarter of last year. On a year-to-date basis, this year, we have invested $1.8 billion in land acquisition development, which keeps us on track to invest between $3.5 billion and $4 billion for the full year. At the end of the second quarter, we had 214,000 lots under control, of which 51% were held via option. The total number of lots we control and the percentage of lots we controlled via option both increased from Q1 of this year as we are working to rebuild our option lot supply after exiting positions in the back half of 2022.We also ended the second quarter with $1.8 billion of cash and a gross debt-to-capital ratio of 17.3%. Given our large cash position, our net debt to capital ratio is now below 3%. Looking briefly at our full year results, on a year-to-date basis, we have generated net income of $1.3 billion, drove the book value of our stock by 12% and returned $472 million to shareholders. At the same time, our financial performance has permitted us to reduce our financial leverage to historic lows, and we have generated a return on equity for the trailing 12 months of 32%. Thank you, and I'll turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.Ryan R. MarshallThanks, Bob. As we've commented, homebuyer demand in the second quarter was strong and continued to exceed the expectation we had coming into the year. In the overwhelming majority of our markets, local pricing dynamics are stable to positive, and we continue to find opportunities to modestly increase net pricing in many of our communities. Further, at an absorption pace of 2.9 homes per month for the period, sales pace for the second quarter was above last year and generally above our pre-COVID averages. Demand in the second quarter was fairly consistent from month to month. And as you would anticipate, with a 24% increase in orders, we generally saw positive demand across our markets, which has continued into the month of July. That being said, on a relative basis, there are communities in our Western markets where we are still having to adjust pricing and/or incentives to entice buyers into our communities and ensure we continue to turn our assets. Given the higher interest rate environment, one of the changes we have seen in the -- is the slight increase in the number of cash buyers, particularly among our active adult customers. As this buyer group moves into our plans for retirement, they are making the decision to carry less mortgage debt given today's higher rates. At the other end of the price spectrum, final purchase decisions among first-time buyers are also being impacted by higher rates. As data suggests, some first-time buyers are opting to go with less square footage or fewer options and upgrades as buyers need to purchase a home in today's dynamic market environment is why our ability to offer a significant mortgage incentive nationally is such an effective sales tool.With that said, our first-time buyers remain financially resilient as personal savings remain the primary source of down payment. At the same time, we continue to see millennials are getting self-support from parents if they need help making the move into homeownership.One final note as to buyer sentiment, recent feedback from our first-time buyers indicate that an overwhelming majority bought a new construction Pulte's home rather than an existing home because they felt it offered the best overall value. We've been extremely thoughtful about the home designs we are putting on the ground and the incentives we are offering to help ensure we are offering a compelling value to our customers.These comments in combination with our 28% increase in second quarter orders within the first-time buyer group indicate our efforts are meeting with success. In closing, I want to thank the entire PulteGroup team for their efforts in delivering such outstanding operating and financial results. On the numbers we show in our financial statements, you continue to provide exceptional homes and home buying experiences to our customers. I will now turn the call back to Jim.James P. ZeumerThanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the time remaining. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. And I'll now ask Avi to explain the process and open the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from John Lovallo with UBS.John LovalloThe first one is the 29% to 29.5% gross margins that you're expecting in the third quarter and the fourth quarter are clearly well above what we were forecasting. Just curious, are there any unusual items in there that we should think about? It sounds like mix is going to be a benefit. And what I'm really trying to get at is, what do you view as sort of the sustainable rate of margin? Is -- are we there? Is this sustainable? And if not, how quickly would you expect a reversion towards that more normalized rate?Ryan R. MarshallJohn, it's Ryan. Thanks for the question. We're really pleased with how all of our consumer groups have been performing and certainly, how we saw the strength of sign-ups by consumer group in the most recent quarter. The mix of business, I think, is very consistent with what you've seen from us over the past 12 months. And as we mentioned in some of our prepared remarks, it's totally in line with kind of our stated goals. So really nothing there that I would highlight of note. And then in terms of kind of the forward kind of margin profile, we've given both a guide for Q3 and Q4, which I think what you want to read into that is that's where we see the business for the balance of the year. We're clearly not giving anything kind of beyond that at this point.John LovalloOkay. That's helpful. And maybe just one more question on margin. I think last quarter, you guys talked about the spread between active adult, move-up an entry level sort of reverting back to historical norms. And I think that was a quick move-in portion kind of going back a little bit on the lower end. Given where housing demand is today and the desire for many folks to move in quickly, are you expecting that sort of quick move-in portion to actually trend higher again?Ryan R. MarshallYes, John, we've actually seen that be pretty stable in terms of the number of orders that are coming from our spec production, which is part of the reason we spent quite a bit of time talking about that today. We like the investment community to understand that the way we're running our production machine is very specific and intentional by buyer group. Specifically, to your point with the first-time buyer group, that business is predominantly a spec business for us. The margins are lower to your point, which is a reversion to what we saw in pre-COVID kind of times that our first-time business was our lowest margin.We typically get a couple of hundred basis points higher out of our move-up and family business. And then our highest margin will come out of our adult -- active adult communities. We're definitely seeing that today. That's the other point that I would really highlight for you in kind of the guide that we've given for margins for the balance of the year. A big part of our business or a big chunk of our business is from our first time entry-level business, which is all incorporated into that guide.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.Michael Jason RehautI guess, first question, just kind of asking the gross margins from a different perspective, and then I have a question on demand. When you think about the more challenged backdrop that the industry faced in the back half of '22, for builders that were more spec oriented. You saw the more immediate impact of that higher promotional, not promotional, but incentives and pricing adjustments that many builders made. You saw that run through the income statement much more immediately. We were estimating for build-to-order builders that, that would have a more of a lag effect. So can you kind of walk through the dynamics of how you've been able to maintain since the fourth quarter?You had some pullback from 2Q '22, but nothing to the extent of the more spec-oriented, perhaps first-time heavy builders. Perhaps the product mix is a factor, but how that higher promotional environment has impacted the financials and if there's offsets to that, that have allowed a much more modest decline as well as for a build-to-order builder, a pretty nice element of stability going into the back half. So sorry for the long-winded, but just trying to understand perhaps what are the offsets to the higher incentive backdrop in the back half and the pluses and minuses there.Ryan R. MarshallYes, Mike. I'll let Bob maybe give you a little more detail on kind of the discounts in the quarter, which we actually -- we've seen kind of come down just a tab sequentially. So in terms of the discounts, we are effectively using our discount money toward mortgage rate buydowns. It's particularly affected with that first-time buyer. I think the reports and some of the data that's out there on mortgage rate environment, which suggests the sweet spot for most buyers is somewhere around 5.5%. So for us, it's really been a reallocation of the incentive dollars away from things that buyers may have previously used those incentives toward we're finding a lot of those incentives are being used in the mortgage rate environment.Michael Jason RehautAnd if, Bob, you can kind of weigh in on any of the pluses and minuses there, it would seem that to the extent that you had any impact from the higher discounting or price adjustment, it would be in the back half of your full year guide. And so just making sure there's no other (inaudible) here or we've kind of worked through some of the more challenging backdrop there. I guess yes...Robert T. O’ShaughnessySorry, yes, there's no shoe, right? We have provided a guide. And so if you're focused on sales activity from the back half of '22, it has either closed or in somewhat limited circumstances will close over the next 3 to 6 months. So it's in our P&amp;L already or reflected in the guide that we have given. The relativity of our markets to the space, if you think about it, our margins didn't go up quite as much in '21 and into the beginning half of '22. And part of the reason for that was we didn't have as much spec production as others did. And so they were pricing product at the time it was completed, getting full value for it whereas we were contracting often times 3 and 6 and 9 months ahead of time.And so some of the price appreciation that went on in the market during the time we were constructing the home, we didn't feel the full benefit of that in our margin profile then. And so you saw kind of the really spec-heavy builders capturing every dollar of value.Now against the next -- if you think about the back half of -- and sorry, of '22 and into '23, they were once again pricing at market. They had the full cost of a heavy lumber load, honestly, and an inflationary environment influencing their cost structure and prices weren't running quite as quickly, particularly in that entry level. So I think their reversion reflected the underwriting of land that they bought and the timing of their construction. Ours, again, for that spec business, we are fully engaged now on that. Again, that is -- you're seeing that in our margins today.It's always worth it to highlight we typically play at a little bit higher price point in that entry-level business, a little bit closer in. And so it's not quite apples-to-apples with some of our competitive set. So I don't want to sound defensive, but there's nothing really unique in this quarter's margin or we would have called it out. There's nothing unique that's coming in the next couple of quarters and the margin is going to stay pretty strong.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Carl Reichardt with BTIG.Carl Edwin ReichardtRyan, you mentioned that 2/3 of your divisions had raised prices over the course of the quarter. Could you expand on that a little bit? Does that mean net average order prices were up? And then can you talk about how that mix and price change was that reduction in incentives, increasing base prices, options upgrades, lot premium? Just want to get a little more color on the price increase activity you're actually putting into the mix right now.Ryan R. MarshallYes, Carl. Two things there. We did see price increases in some of our communities in 2/3 of the division. So it wasn't every division, it wasn't every single community. But we are seeing pockets of strength where we're able to, to your question, I'll answer the affirmative, it is a net increase in net pricing and it's coming through all of the options that you listed. So there are modest increases. And those are -- I would note that those are off of what we would consider adjusted kind of current cycle floor pricing. So we feel like we've seen a bit of strengthening in the overall sales environment, which allowed us to modestly increase pricing.Carl Edwin ReichardtOkay, Ryan. And then to drill down on the first-time buyer Centex spec business, what kind of backlog conversion rate do you sort of target in that business specifically? And then can you mention maybe a little bit more color on cycle time improvement, where you have been, where you are now and where you think you can go with sort of normalized supply chain over the course of the next couple of 3 quarters?Ryan R. MarshallYes, Carl. I don't have a specific number for you on backlog conversion of that specific buyer group. We could follow up with you offline on that. The things that we're really monitoring there, we're running a -- with that spec business, specifically, we're running a predictable and consistent monthly start rate. And we've worked to match that start rate to what we believe our monthly sales rate has been, is and will be. And so it's part of what you heard me talk about in my prepared remarks around getting our start rate matched to the sales rate, which we think we've effectively done.And then the second question cycle times, Carl, yes, we're starting to see those come down very much in line with our anticipated improvements throughout the year. It's not been easy. It's been a lot of hard work by our procurement teams, our construction managers and certainly our trade partners that have helped us to reduce those cycle times. So we're seeing at least a couple of weeks come out of the cycle times and certainly starts that are going in the ground today. We'd expect to maybe even get a little bit more by the time that those deliver. That's been a big contributor to our success, not only in Q2, but to the updated and increased guide for full year closings that we've provided today.OperatorWe will take our next question from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.Stephen KimGreat job. Beats go on. Nice to see. I guess I had a question about -- just to touch on the volume side of the story. Can you give us a sense for what kind of rate of growth in community count, the current level of land spend that you're allocating here? What kind of growth in community count can that support? It's a general question, looking out not specific to 3Q necessarily.And can you also regarding volume. Can you give us a sense for what the absorption rates? What the dispersion looks like across your 3 major segments?Ryan R. MarshallYes, Stephen. I'm reluctant to answer your first question because we haven't provided any view beyond the third and fourth quarters. And so I'm going to pass on that.And then in terms of the absorption paces, we haven't provided that level of detail. What I can tell you is that in the current operating environment, the quickest-growing part of the business is move-up right now, interestingly enough. So absorptions there grew faster. We had absorption growth across all 3 demographics. And so we had highlighted 28% growth in the first time, 33% in the move-up and 7% in the active adult. But on a per store basis, all of them were up. The richest contributor to that actually was the move-up space.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.Matthew Adrien BouleyI guess I'll just go back to the gross margin side. Maybe just to put a finer point on it. I think I heard you say that the, I guess, mix of sort of incentivized build-to-order product from end of '22 sales has largely worked through at this point. So what exactly would be, I guess, a worse headwind in the gross margin in the third quarter relative to the second quarter? Is it entirely mix of entry level -- or excuse me, first-time buyer spec? Or what exactly is the greater headwind to cause that sequential step down in margins?Ryan R. MarshallYes, it's a couple of things. One, we are in inflationary environment. Our land is more expensive, labor is more expensive, material is more expensive. You can see lumbers trending up given the faster cycle times, some of that is going to come into our production in the back half of the year. And then certainly, the mix on a geographic basis matters. And so we'll see some contributions from some margin communities that we've had to adjust as we've gone through the year. It's normal. So I know it's a nonanswer, but mix always matters in that conversation.Matthew Adrien BouleyGot it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, secondly, just back on that last point around the improvement in move-up, obviously, looking at the second quarter of last year, I mean, the comp is a little bit easier, but clearly, a nice step-up there. Any finer detail? I mean you gave a lot of color at the top around just what's kind of locking in existing home sellers at this point, but you are seeing this nice tick up in your move-up business. So kind of what do you think is sort of driving that? And do you expect it to continue relative to entry level?Ryan R. MarshallYes. Matthew, I think that's the biggest driver is there's just such a shortage of supply and fewer options for that move-up buyer to choose from. So as a percentage of the available choices that are out there, new homes have become a much bigger piece of that. And I think you're seeing our move-up business benefit from that.I would share that we've got great communities. We've got excellent designs. The quality of the homes that we're building, I think, are really speaking to that move-up buyer that's looking to add more space or get a newer, more energy-efficient, more technological advanced homes. So I think those things are working to our advantage as well. And in this higher interest rate environment, our ability to offer our national mortgage rate incentive program to the move-up buyer is meaningful as well. That's a tool that we're able to effectively leverage that the resale market is not at the same degree. So I think a number of factors there with the headline being there's just less inventory out there.Matthew Adrien BouleyGood luck, guys.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question Alan Ratner with Zelman &amp; Associates.Alan S. RatnerFirst, I'd love to drill in a little bit on the topic from Steve's question about land spend. If you look at your closing guide, it's gone up about 20% for this year since the start of the year. And your land spend guide hasn't really changed, still kind of in that $3.5 billion to $4 billion range. And I know that's a big range, so maybe the answer is you're coming in closer to the high end versus the low end.But I'm just curious, as you think about the next few years, I mean, $3.5 billion to $4 billion, probably is pretty close to a replacement level of land, maybe a bit below, but as you think about the land market today and what you're seeing there, is that an area where you feel like at some point, you're going to have to put pedal to the metal and get more aggressive on land spend to drive future growth? And I guess, alternatively, is there a risk of a similar dynamic unfolding from a few years ago, where if demand stays at these levels and you don't see the opportunities in the land market, do you start to limit sales again and do things to kind of keep a lid on that to prevent gap-outs?Ryan R. MarshallYes, Alan, thanks for the questions. Ryan. A couple of things. Maybe I'd start with there. For starters, we actually did increase our projected land spend number about a quarter ago. So when we went into the year, I think we were right around $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. We've moved that up with the high end and as high as $4 billion, certainly down from last year, and that was intentional. When we look at our controlled lot supply, we've got 215,000 lots, plus or minus, under control. Over half of those are controlled via options. So we feel pretty good about kind of what's in the pipeline and what that will mean for the business.Market share and growth are certainly part of our story and part of the things that we're trying to do with our strategy. To your question, Alan, around what are we seeing in the land market, I'd tell you that we're able to get deals done. It is a competitive market, and there certainly isn't anything that's being liquidated or fire sold, but we are to -- our land teams are doing a nice job finding good opportunities, and we've stayed consistent with our disciplined underwriting process, which has yielded the types of results and quarters that we've delivered over the last several years.So our plan is to stick with that to continue, to stay very balanced and disciplined and running a good business and being really laser focused on picking our spots with where we're investing more capital. So to this point, I don't think we need to do anything along the lines of put the pedal to the metal. I think we're going to continue to be foot on the gas, but we're going to continue to focus on monetizing the 214,000 lots that we have, which we'll see what the market holds, but I think that will give us an opportunity to continue to run a very nice business that will grow at the market.Alan S. RatnerGot it. I really appreciate that. That's helpful. Second, I do have a question about Florida. You guys are pretty as large in Florida, and there's been a lot written of late about the issues with property insurance in the state and some pretty staggering increases there. And I know some of that can be certainly sensationalized. But I'm curious, a, are you seeing that become more of a concern among homeowners or potential home buyers today in the state? And b, are you aware of anything that the industry might be doing to kind of deal with this issue, because it seems like it could have some long-term ramifications?Ryan R. MarshallYes, Alan. We haven't seen it become a problem for buyers to make the decision to move into our Florida communities. And in fact, our Florida business has been one of our strongest best-performing regions. And we've got a very diversified business in Florida that ranges from entry level to a heavy move-up business in Tampa and Orlando. And then when you get into South Florida, our active adult consumer and second home buyers are very prevalent. We've got great businesses there.Part of our financial services operation, we have an insurance company. We aggregate and we talk about the numbers and the business that they generate as part of our overall financial service portfolio. But we find that our captive insurance agency does a nice job helping to solve some of those problems. Florida is one of those places, Alan, and I think over the years. There's been an ebb and a flow of insurers that are in the market, they leave, they come back, having lived in Florida personally for a long time. I saw that happened over the last 15 years with my own insurance companies, but they wouldn't renew. They'd leave for a few years and then inevitably, they come back and they want the business again.So we'll keep an eye on it. California is the other state that there's been a lot in the news media recently about a lot of insurance companies that have left the state due to large losses. So certainly, things that we want to keep an eye on, I would highlight that there are -- there is a view that new homes performed better. They're in -- from a flood standpoint, they're up to spec out of the flood plain, higher than homes that have been developed in recent past. The drainage systems are more prevalent. They're built to current code. You've got new electrical, they're more energy efficient. So there's an argument to say there's potentially less risk with newer constructed homes.OperatorWe will take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.Michael Glaser DahlOne more follow-up on the land side. Ryan, you mentioned you're not necessarily seeing like liquidation opportunities. The market is competitive. There were some thoughts or hopes that some of the regional banking fallout might shake some land to lose. Maybe you can comment on that. But then also in terms of classes that your land teams are having, given the competition out there, has it been more that you're getting to your underwriting box because your current pace and price has improved? Or has it been a buyer as have also adjusted downward?I'm sure there's some blend, but kind of on average, what do you think is helping more at this point? Is it that -- or that sellers have actually adjusted? Or is it more that at current pace and price, more things hit the box?Robert T. O’ShaughnessyYes. As always, as Ryan said, land is not on sale. We have not seen opportunities on large-scale things for banks or private market transactions of any substance. And in terms of the current activity levels, I think it's a combination of both and it probably depends on where you are in the country. There are parts of the country where we have seen some willingness to negotiate on land because the market is a little stickier than it was 18 or 24 months ago. But by and large, no, the market is pretty firm. And we are -- we have not changed our underwriting screen at all. Based on activity levels that we see and can project, we're able to make them underwrite, but they're not on sale.Michael Glaser DahlOkay. That makes sense, Bob. And then just as a follow-up, maybe I'll broaden that out. Slightly when we think about some of these dynamics, could you just touch on more specifically your sticks and bricks cost, both in the quarter? How we should be thinking about that in the second half? I know you alluded to lumber -- some lumber increases maybe creeping in, but maybe any more quantification of sticks and bricks? And then on the lot side, how should we be thinking about inflationary dynamics in your way at cost here over the next, say, 4 quarters?Robert T. O’ShaughnessyYes. I think on the land side, and we always answer it this way, we don't have any ramp up or ramp down in our land portfolio. And so the normal inflationary aspect we see comes if we buy land in 3-year increments. We develop it. We then build on it and cost it off. And so we've seen a pretty steady increase. I wouldn't want to put a particular percentage on it because it varies on when we are in the -- if you think over the last 5 years, the way pricing has moved.On the vertical side and even on the horizontal development side to get outside of the acquisition side of the dirt, we came into the year projecting, call it, 12% to 14% increase in costs. We've been able to dial that down. We highlighted on the last call, we were 8% to 9%. We're still there. So our total house cost is up about that year-over-year, and that's going to be inclusive of lumber save earlier in the year. It started to pick back up, materials and labor is the real driver of that. We've been able to work with our trades to try and find efficiencies. Ryan talked about it. We want to be a production consistent cadence of starts, consistency in the production cycle that makes it easier for the trades.And now that the supply chain is healthier, we've been able to reduce some of the cost increases through efficiency, not on the purchasing side for materials because, again, that inflationary aspect is there. And when you kind of wash all that together, we're seeing costs up, like I said, 8% to 9%.OperatorWe will take our next question from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research.Truman Andrew PattersonFirst, you all generated almost $1.5 billion in operating cash flow in the first half of the year. Clearly, you've been rebuilding your spec pipeline, you're kind of cutting back on some land investment, but you should still generate some pretty healthy net income in the back half of the year. I'm just really hoping you can run us through some of the pluses and minuses on your full year '23 operating cash flow potential.Robert T. O’ShaughnessyYes. We haven't got to guide on that true, but you're exactly right. I mean, if you think about it, we generated $1.5 billion through the first 6 months of the year. And if you put, I think, the closing volumes and the cost estimates for margins and for SG&amp;A, the operating margin on that forward business at a sales price of $540 million is pretty rich. And certainly, inventory levels will change. But we think actually that we have an opportunity to reduce our investment in-house over the balance of the year because of the improvement in signal times. So to your point, we're going to generate a bunch of cash in the back half of the year.Truman Andrew PattersonFair enough. Fair enough. And then just wanted to follow up on a prior question. But given the healthy demand rebound so far, it looks like your absorption levels are at pretty healthy levels, a little bit above what we'll just call kind of historical 2Q averages over the past decade, if you will. Could you just run through whether there were any geographies or consumer segment where you're actually perhaps curbing absorptions again as of the second quarter?Ryan R. MarshallYes, Truman, we're -- look, we're always balancing our production machine with the amount of developed land that we have in front of us as well as what our trade capacity is. But other than a unique community here or there that is way oversubscribed, we're not in the type of allocation restriction mode that we saw maybe during COVID.OperatorWe will take our next question from Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.Unidentified AnalystThis is Ashu Sonen on for Anthony. I just wanted to ask relative to sort of the sequential price growth on ASP in net orders you saw in the quarter. Was that pretty much like-for-like? Or maybe there might have been some mix impact? And then sort of more broadly, would you say pricing power has gotten stronger at all versus where you were seeing it on your last call in April?Ryan R. MarshallYes. I think we highlighted that some of that in our prepared remarks, and there was a question earlier, we have in certain geographies and certain communities have been able to modestly increase prices from what was arguably a pricing floor after we made adjustments late last year. So part of that is related to an effective use of the mortgage incentive, which we've used to help solve some affordability challenges. But part of that is there's a real shortage of inventory and the market is allowing us to make some modest price increases. So all of that's kind of reflected in the results that we had for Q2 as well as the guide that we've given for the balance of this year.Unidentified AnalystGreat. And then what are your thoughts on kind of the sustainability of progress you've made on cycle times and costs kind of heading into '24 as housing activity is heating back up. Are you -- do you anticipate maybe pressure on cycle times?Ryan R. MarshallYes. We actually believe that we still got opportunity to continue to do more. And Bob highlighted it in the question that he just answered a minute ago for Truman. As it relates to cash, we feel that we've got opportunity to continue to reduce cycle time, not only in the balance of this year, but well into '24. It's predominantly coming from a healing of the supply chain and removing a lot of the inefficiencies that crept in, given -- but we had a broken supply chain and trades were incredibly inefficient.So we're making progress. We're pleased with it, but we're probably nowhere near where we'd like to be. Our target still remains getting back to pre-COVID cycle times, which is where I think the company can operate.OperatorWe will take our next question from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.Susan Marie MaklariSo my first question is thinking a bit about the supply chain and the rise that we're seeing generally in starts within single family, how do you think about the industry's ability to continue to improve and perhaps sustain some of this as overall demand continues to move higher? And are there any areas specifically that you're more focused on or where we could perhaps see some issues bubble up again?Robert T. O’ShaughnessyYes. So the supply chain is mostly healthy. There are certainly pockets of places where we're continuing to focus. But I think labor, while tight, it's generally available, and we're making -- we're using it efficiently, and it's working. Supply chain, we feel pretty good about. The one area that I'd highlight is electrical components, specifically around switch gear that goes into multifamily buildings, so townhomes and condos. Those are more unique and sometimes customized products that are difficult to find in the cycle. And the lead time to get those things ordered has continued to extend.The other one would be transformer, so transformers that go into the horizontal land development side of things. Those are also in short supply. So a couple of things on the electrical component side. Other than that, I would tell you that labor and supply chain are operating pretty effectively.Susan Marie MaklariOkay. And then thinking about the business longer term, as your ROE starts to come off the peak that we've seen more recently, but you think about the longer-term operating dynamics on the ground today and perhaps how they've changed relative to where we were coming into the pandemic? Are there things that you think you can hold on to so that the ROE can perhaps stabilize a touch higher than that 20% or low 20% range that you were in before COVID?Robert T. O’ShaughnessySusan, I'll try. It's Bob. I think we are seeking to be efficient with our capital. We've got share repurchase activity we highlighted. We've got $400 million that we've done this year already. But we're creating a lot of equity through the earnings of the business. So I think the modeling that you're trying to do doesn't really factor into our decision making, right? We're making investment decisions on ability to generate return over time.Do I think that there's an opportunity to do better than we've done historically? Yes, of course, we can be more efficient with our balance sheet. So we highlighted earlier this year that we had $1 billion of extra capital tied up in-house. We've long talked about trying to increase the optionality of our land book, which would be an opportunity for us as well. We're at 50% today -- 51%, sorry. So I think if we can make progress on those fronts, we have an opportunity to continue to generate really strong returns through time.OperatorWe will take our next question from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank.Unidentified AnalystJust a follow-up on that last question. Perhaps if you could just talk if you've got in your mind, an upper limit on the idle cash that you might carry on your balance sheet, going forward? And then also just maybe talk about your appetite for increasing leverage just given the stability in your business?Ryan R. MarshallYes. I don't know that there's -- I wouldn't want to put guardrails around anything we do. Yes, we've been pretty clear and it's 10-plus years now in terms of how we're going to allocate our capital. We've also been, I think, pretty clear that we don't take a point in time assessment of that. We have a business plan and a model that we've created, and we iterate through time that we use to make the decisions on how to invest that capital and just a refresher in the business first and high return. We want to pay a dividend. We use excess capital to buy back stock we'll manage that against leverage.We've reduced the expected leverage in the business. If you think back a decade ago, we said between 30% and 40% gross debt to cap. We adjusted that 20% to 30%. We're under that today. I think you could see us do lots of things. And I wouldn't want to say, well, if we have more than x dollars of cash, we're going to do something different. We'll continue down the same path. We spent time with the Board working through the different capital decisions we make. And I think that's exactly what will be going forward.Unidentified AnalystGot it. And then just maybe if you could talk about the improvement relative to pre-pandemic in your gross margins and your returns on inventory, if there's a number you could quantify around production improvements and even more specifically, if the actions you've taken getting back into the off-site construction space, if there's anything to call out there? And maybe just an update on how ICG is doing?Robert T. O’ShaughnessyYes. Let me take the ICG piece. We're really pleased with how that business is operating. We have 2 factories up and operational that are doing well for us, and we're very pleased with what we're getting there. We've talked about once we get some additional factories up and open and it's covering a bigger percentage of the business we'll share more detail about the cycle time gains, the cost savings that we're seeing from that business, but we're really pleased with what that team is doing.In terms of the first part of your question, it...Ryan R. MarshallIt's interesting. I would tell you, we're -- you're asking if there are productivity gains. If I understood the question correctly, you're asking if there are productivity gains that we've gained by virtue of the pandemic that we might be able to save post pandemic. I would tell you exactly the opposite is true. We have a less efficient business, and it shows up in our cycle times, right? And the supply chain dynamics caused us to lose production efficiency. And you heard Ryan say it a minute ago, we think we've got opportunity to improve from here on that.OperatorWe will take our next question from Alex Barron with Housing Research Center.Unidentified AnalystYes. Just to ask again on the ICG. Is there any plans to roll this out to more markets near term?Ryan R. MarshallYes, Alex, when we made our first acquisition around our off-site our off-site manufacturing efforts. We said we believe we can have up to about 8 plants that will impact about 70% of our overall production volume. That's still the path that we're on. We're -- we haven't announced any new openings, but the strategic direction of 8 plants over time and 70% of the business still holds firm.Unidentified AnalystGot it. And I'm not sure if I missed it, but did you guys give your land position and owned an option?Ryan R. MarshallI gave the total control, but I give you the owned is 14,000 lots. The option is 110,000 lots for a total control of 214,000 lots.Unidentified AnalystGot it. And in terms of direction, obviously, a lot of builders, I guess, yourselves included kind of slowdown acquisition of lots at the end of last year, but are you guys seeing the next few months is something that will reaccelerate or just still kind of hold near current levels?Ryan R. MarshallYes, Alex, we gave -- we kind of gave our updated land guide, which is at $4 billion, which is a lot of money. It's not an insignificant investment in our overall land portfolio. Roughly half of that is new acquisition. The other half of that spend is on development on lots that we already own. 214,000 lots gives us certainly ample runway and supply for our go-forward business and going back to some of the answers that I gave on similar questions earlier, we're really confident in our land acquisitions team to continue to find good spots, negotiate what we believe are fair in market prices that will continue to help us generate industry-leading returns and gross margins and help us continue to grow the business.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America.Rafe Jason JadrosichCan you just talk about the sort of specific drivers of the quarter-over-quarter step-up in gross margin in the second quarter? And then what drove upside relative to your guidance from a quarter ago?Ryan R. MarshallYou're meaning sequentially, right?Rafe Jason JadrosichCorrect.Ryan R. MarshallYes. So we had highlighted that a couple of things influence it relative to our guide. One is we got better pricing on specs than we were projecting. And the second was the mix of communities that we got closings from looked a little bit different than we thought. So you can see from the sales environment that the market was pretty strong. We were able to translate that in the specs that we saw. Really, those are the 2 primary drivers that's why we called it out in more.Rafe Jason JadrosichGot it. Okay. That's helpful. And then you've spoken a little bit about the underwriting strategy going forward. Like how should we think about your option mix going forward? And like what's the longer-term target relative to the current 51%?Ryan R. MarshallYes, we've been pretty clear. We had targeted 50% a year or so ago, we increased that to a target of 70%. We have gotten to a point, I think at the richest, we were at 56%. We walked from about 60,000 lots over the back half of 2022. When you pulled us back down closer to 50%, now we're starting to rebuild again, fair remark. We had highlighted, we've been able to increase that in this most recent quarter. And again, the target still remains to try to be about 70%.OperatorAnd ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today. And I will now turn the call back to Mr. Jim Zeumer for closing remarks.James P. ZeumerI appreciate everybody joining us on the call today. We're around and available to the remainder of the day if you've got any questions. Otherwise, we'll look forward to speaking with you on our next quarterly call. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

201,56372c7b-b1b8-3bac-a7d3-2b2d84dfc816,WEC,2023-07-26,Analysts Estimate WEC Energy Group (WEC) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-wec-energy-group-140121213.html,1690293681,STORY,['WEC'],"[WEC Energy Group (WEC) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis electricity and natural gas provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.86 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5.5%.Revenues are expected to be $2.17 billion, up 1.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.31% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for WEC Energy?For WEC Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.49%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that WEC Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that WEC Energy would post earnings of $1.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.61, delivering a surprise of +1.26%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.WEC Energy doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, PG&amp;E (PCG) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.28 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +12%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $5.65 billion, up 10.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for PG&amp;E has been revised 8.9% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -10.71%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PG&amp;E will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We’ve received many positive surprises throughout the period as companies navigate a unique macroeconomic situation. In fact, four companies – PepsiCo PEP, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, General Electric GE, and ASML Holding ASML – have all delivered a beat-and-raise quarter. Let’s take a closer look at each’s quarterly results and guidance upgrades.PepsiCoConsumer staples titan PepsiCo exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by a strong 7% and reported revenue more than 3% ahead of expectations thanks to strong consumer demand and continued business momentum. Earnings saw growth of 13%, whereas revenue climbed 10% from the year-ago quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor the company’s FY23, PEP expects to deliver 10% organic revenue growth (8% previously) and 12% core EPS growth (9% previously). PepsiCo has enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions across several periods following the release, with the stock sporting a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares saw a nice move post-earnings, with PEP shares gaining roughly 2%.Johnson &amp; JohnsonJohnson &amp; Johnson’s quarterly results came in nicely above expectations, with the company exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by more than 7% and delivering a positive 3% revenue surprise. Quarterly revenue totaled $25.5 billion, seeing a 6% improvement from the year-ago period.Like PEP, the company’s top line has remained steady.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFollowing the better-than-expected results, JNJ raised its FY23 adjusted EPS guidance, expecting a profit of $10.70 – $10.80 per share ($10.60 – $10.70 previously). Positive earnings estimate revisions unsurprisingly followed, with the Zacks Consensus EPS FY23 estimate of $10.73 up nearly 1% since the end of June. The stock is now a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The results impressed the market, with JNJ shares closing 6% higher post-earnings.Story continuesASML HoldingASML posted EPS of $5.37, 8% ahead of our consensus estimate and improving a solid 42% from the year-ago period. The semiconductor player posted 2023 Q2 revenues of $7.5 billion, 30% higher year-over-year. Despite posting solid year-over-year growth, ASML shares faced selling pressure post-earnings, perhaps reflecting profit-taking among investors. Following the results, ASML forecasts FY23 net sales to grow roughly 30%, above the previously guided 25%. In addition, the company is mindful of macroeconomic uncertainties but believes that its strong backlog provides a buffer against headwinds.The company has seen positive earnings estimate revisions across its current fiscal year and next, helping land the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGeneral ElectricGeneral Electric delivered a highly favorable report, beating earnings expectations by a sizable 48% and reporting revenue of $16.7 billion. The company witnessed double-digit growth in orders, revenue, operating profit, and cash, topping off the robust results with a guidance upgrade.GE expects organic revenue growth in the low-double-digit range, up from the previously guided high-single-digit expectation. In addition, the company expects FY23 adjusted EPS in a range of $2.10 – $2.30, up nicely from the previous $1.70 – $2.00 per share expected. And to top it off, General Electric forecasts FY23 free cash flow of $4.1 – $4.6 billion (previously $3.6 billion – $4.2 billion).The market took the better-than-results in stride, with GE shares jumping following the announcement in pre-market trading. Positive revisions haven’t hit the tape yet, but we’ll likely see them in the coming days following the guidance upgrade.Bottom LineWith earnings season in full swing, investors will likely face many positive surprises.And so far, all four above – PepsiCo PEP, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, General Electric GE, and ASML Holding ASML – have done precisely that, delivering better-than-expected results and lifting their guidance.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned +4.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Johnson &amp; Johnson falls in, has gained 0.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.70 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.73 points to a change of +5.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.28 indicates a change of +5.1% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Johnson &amp; Johnson.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $24.85 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $99.85 billion and $102.64 billion estimates indicate +5.2% and +2.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $25.53 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.3%. EPS of $2.80 for the same period compares with $2.59 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.43%. The EPS surprise was +7.28%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Nasdaq: MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, today announced the initiation of the pivotal Phase 3 randomized V940-001 clinical trial evaluating V940 (mRNA-4157), an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy (INT), in combination with KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, as an adjuvant treatment in patients with resected high-risk (Stage IIB-IV) melanoma. Global recruitment in V940-001 has begun, and the first patients are now enrolling in Australia.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230726379908/en/""As we continue our efforts to advance novel treatment options for patients with high-risk Stage IIB-IV melanoma, the initiation of the V940-001 Phase 3 trial represents an important step forward in these efforts and our study of individualized neoantigen therapy,"" said Dr. Marjorie Green, senior vice president and head of late-stage oncology, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""We look forward to continuing to collaborate with Moderna to evaluate this promising new approach with V940 (mRNA-4157), while also building on a standard of care laid by KEYTRUDA.""""The initiation of the V940-001 Phase 3 trial is an exciting and important milestone for us as we work with our colleagues at Merck and the melanoma patient community to investigate how individualized neoantigen therapy may potentially transform the treatment of the most serious form of skin cancer,"" said Kyle Holen, M.D., Moderna's Senior Vice President and Head of Development, Therapeutics and Oncology. ""We thank the patients, investigators, and clinical trial sites across the world for helping us advance our efforts in this area.""Story continuesV940-001 is a Phase 3 global, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-comparator-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of V940 (mRNA-4157) in combination with KEYTRUDA in people with resected high-risk (Stage IIB-IV) melanoma compared to KEYTRUDA alone. The trial is slated to enroll approximately 1,089 patients at more than 165 sites in over 25 countries around the world. The primary endpoint of the study is recurrence-free survival (RFS), and secondary endpoints include distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.Based on data from the Phase 2b KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 study, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation and the Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme, respectively, for V940 (mRNA-4157) in combination with KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with high-risk melanoma. The companies presented the study’s primary endpoint, RFS, in April 2023 at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting and presented the study’s key secondary endpoint, DMFS, in June 2023 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. The companies also plan to expand the development program to additional tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer.About V940 (mRNA-4157)V940 (mRNA-4157) is a novel investigational messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based individualized neoantigen therapy (INT) consisting of a single synthetic mRNA coding for up to 34 neoantigens that is designed and produced based on the unique mutational signature of the DNA sequence of the patient’s tumor. Upon administration into the body, the algorithmically derived and RNA-encoded neoantigen sequences are endogenously translated and undergo natural cellular antigen processing and presentation, a key step in adaptive immunity.Individualized neoantigen therapies are designed to train and activate the immune system so that a patient can generate an antitumor response specific to their tumor mutation signature. V940 (mRNA-4157) is designed to stimulate an immune response by generating specific T-cell responses based on the unique mutational signature of a patient’s tumor. KEYTRUDA is an immunotherapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. Based on early clinical studies and data from the Phase 2b KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 trial, combining V940 (mRNA-4157) with KEYTRUDA may provide an additive benefit over KEYTRUDA alone.About V940-001 (NCT05933577)V940-001 is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-comparator-controlled Phase 3 trial evaluating 1,089 patients with resected high-risk (Stage IIB-IV) melanoma. Following complete surgical resection, participants 18 years and older will be randomized 2:1 to receive V940 (mRNA-4157) (1 mg every three weeks for up to nine doses) and KEYTRUDA (400 mg every six weeks up to nine cycles [approximately one year]) versus KEYTRUDA alone for approximately one year until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity, or for a total treatment duration of up to approximately 56 weeks, whichever is sooner. The primary endpoint is RFS, defined as the time from randomization to any type of disease recurrence as assessed by the investigator, or death due to any cause. The secondary endpoints are DMFS, OS, safety and quality of life.Key eligibility criteria for the trial include: patients who have surgically resected and histologically/pathologically confirmed diagnosis of Stage IIB or IIC, III or IV cutaneous melanoma, patients who have not received any prior systemic therapy for their melanoma beyond surgical resection and no more than 13 weeks have passed between final surgical resection.For further information, please see: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05933577About melanomaMelanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. The rates of melanoma have been rising over the past few decades, with nearly 325,000 new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2020. In the U.S., skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed, and melanoma accounts for a large majority of skin cancer deaths. It is estimated there will be nearly 100,000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed and almost 8,000 deaths resulting from the disease in the U.S. in 2023.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.MelanomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism.

Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic KetoacidosisMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA.

Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

For a quick overview of the top five countries, read our article 5 Countries with the Highest Rates of Skin Cancer. Skin Cancer Statistics WorldwideSkin cancer, a malignancy that begins in the cells of the skin, is more than just a localized concern — it's a global health issue. Skin cancer, when categorized into its three primary types — basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma — presents varying degrees of risk. Melanoma, despite accounting for only about 1% of skin cancer cases, causes the majority of skin cancer deaths, which makes it the deadliest.The prevalence of skin cancer has been on the rise globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), between 2 to 3 million non-melanoma skin cancers and 132,000 melanoma skin cancers occur globally each year.Notably, the incidence of melanoma is rising faster than any other cancer. Between 2005-2020, melanoma rates increased by 44%, making it one of the fastest-growing cancers in terms of incidence.The incidence rates of skin cancer vary dramatically across different parts of the world, largely due to differences in skin type, climatic conditions, and cultural habits. The Skin Cancer Foundation highlights that in the United States alone, more people are diagnosed with skin cancer each year than all other cancers combined. Furthermore, an estimated one in five Americans will develop skin cancer by the age of 70.In addition to the human cost, the economic burden of skin cancer is enormous. In the United States alone, the annual cost of treating skin cancers is estimated at $8.1 billion — about $4.8 billion for non-melanoma skin cancers and $3.3 billion for melanoma.However, the good news is that the early detection and treatment of skin cancer can drastically improve patient outcomes. The five-year survival rate for melanoma, if detected and treated before it spreads to the lymph nodes, is as high as 98%.Story continuesThe WHO emphasizes the effectiveness of preventive measures such as avoiding midday sun, wearing protective clothing, and applying sunscreen, in reducing the risk of skin cancer.Where is Skin Cancer Most Common in the WorldThe prevalence of skin cancer is particularly high in certain regions, primarily due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.When it comes to the countries with the highest rates of skin cancer, Australia and New Zealand consistently report the highest incidences. This can be attributed to their geographical location, which places them closer to the ozone hole over Antarctica, thereby exposing them to higher levels of harmful UV radiation. Additionally, these countries have large populations of individuals with fair skin, which is more susceptible to UV damage. The outdoor-oriented lifestyle popular in these nations further increases exposure to the sun.It's important to note that Europe isn't exempt from this concern either. Despite less intense sun exposure, Northern European countries like Norway and Denmark report high incidences of melanoma, likely due to their large fair-skinned populations.Lowest Skin Cancer Rates by CountryCountries in Africa, particularly those in the Central and Western regions, generally exhibit the lowest rates of skin cancer globally. In Asia, countries such as Japan, China, and India also report lower rates of skin cancer. This can largely be attributed to the darker skin types of the majority of their populations, which provide some natural protection against UV radiation due to higher melanin content. The cultural practice of avoiding sun exposure, prevalent in many Asian societies, also contributes to this lower incidence.Skin cancer rates in the Middle East have also not been traditionally as high as in Western countries. However, there has been an increasing trend of skin cancer rates in several Middle Eastern countries, such as Israel, which has a significant population of fair-skinned individuals. A key reason for this is likely the high level of UV radiation exposure combined with a population that has a higher proportion of individuals susceptible to sun damage.It's worth mentioning that there are substantial differences within the region, with countries closer to the equator having a higher incidence rate than those further away.The Role of the Skin Care Industry in Fighting the DiseaseThe global fight against skin cancer has led to the rise of a thriving industry focused on prevention, early detection, and treatment. This industry, which is a segment of the larger oncology market, encompasses pharmaceuticals, biotech firms, medical device manufacturers, and healthcare technology companies.At the forefront of this industry are pharmaceutical and biotech companies developing new and innovative treatments for skin cancer. These range from topical creams and traditional chemotherapy to more targeted treatments like immunotherapies and targeted therapies, which aim to attack cancer cells without damaging healthy tissue.Companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), Merck &amp; Co. (NYSE:MRK), and Roche (SWX:ROG) have been key players in the skin cancer therapeutics market with approved drugs like Opdivo, Keytruda, and Tecentriq, respectively.Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) has been at the forefront of the oncology sector. One of the most significant products of Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) is Opdivo (nivolumab), an immunotherapy drug that has been used to treat various types of cancer, including melanoma.Merck (NYSE:MRK) is a leading global biopharmaceutical company. Merck’s (NYSE:MRK) immunotherapy drug Keytruda (pembrolizumab) has been approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma and is associated with improved survival and fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy.Roche (SWX:ROG) has been at the forefront of cancer research and treatment for many years. Roche’s (SWX:ROG) medication Zelboraf (vemurafenib) has been a game-changer for patients with a specific type of metastatic melanoma.The medical device sector has also seen substantial growth. Dermoscopy devices, for example, used for the early detection of skin cancer, have seen increasing adoption across healthcare settings.Finally, the rise of digital health technologies has fostered the growth of companies providing apps or AI-based solutions for skin cancer detection. For instance, companies like SkinVision and Miiskin have developed apps allowing users to monitor their skin and detect potential skin cancer signs early.20 Countries with the Highest Rates of Skin CancerPhoto by national cancer institute on UnsplashMethodologyTo create this list of countries with the highest rates of skin cancer, we utilized data from the Global Cancer Observatory's (GCO) ""Estimated Age-Standardized Incidence Rates (World) in 2020"" index. The GCO is part of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an intergovernmental agency forming part of the World Health Organization (WHO).For this specific list, we focused on incidence rates of two types of skin cancer: melanoma of the skin and non-melanoma skin cancer for all age groups. These estimates were gathered from the GLOBOCAN database, a segment of the GCO. GLOBOCAN provides contemporary estimates of the incidence of, mortality, and prevalence of major types of cancer, at a national level, for 185 countries of the world.To ensure the validity and accuracy of our findings, we specifically examined sex- and age-specific incidence rates in 2020. These rates provide an understanding of how skin cancer impacts different genders and age groups within a population. It's important to note that these rates are standardized per 100,000 individuals to account for variations in population size between countries and enable accurate comparisons.Below is our list of the top countries with the highest rates of skin cancer.Top 20 Countries with the Highest Rates of Skin Cancer20. Czech RepublicSkin cancer incidence rate: 24.5Between 1977 and 2018 in Czechia, melanoma showed the highest increase among all malignant neoplasms, with an average annual rise of 4.0% in men and 3.3% in women. WHO 2020 data reported 2,587 new cases of melanoma and 427 deaths as a result.19. ItalySkin cancer incidence rate: 26.4Italian Cancer Society reports that Italian people get an annual average incidence of 12.5 skin melanoma cases for males and 13.1 cases for females per 100,000 population. WHO 2020 data reports around 12,515 new melanoma cases in Italy and 2,224 deaths as a result.18. AustriaSkin cancer incidence rate: 27.5According to the WHO 2020 data, Austria reported 2,043 new cases of melanoma skin cancer. Melanoma is one of the five most frequent cancers in the country, alongside the cancers of the prostate, lung, bladder, and colorectum.17. SloveniaSkin cancer incidence rate: 28.4Melanoma is one of the top five most frequent cancers in Slovenia as well, with new reported incidence cases of 735 and death number of 127 each year. Prostate, lung, colon, and breast cancers are the other four major types of cancer in the country.16. FinlandSkin cancer incidence rate: 29.7Despite its high quality of life and happiness score, Finland ranks among the countries with the highest rates of skin cancer. Melanoma diagnoses in Finland are increasing by 5% annually, with potential underdiagnoses due to Covid-related disruptions. Warmer future summers may raise skin cancer risk due to increased UV radiation.15. FranceSkin cancer incidence rate: 36.9France has been estimated to reach an alarming 433,136 new cancer cases in 2023. Cancer remains the primary cause of premature death in men, and the second in women. The surge is attributed to population growth, aging, lifestyle, and environmental factors.14. United KingdomSkin cancer incidence rate: 39.8Melanoma diagnoses in the UK reached a record 19,256 new cases in 2020, making it the fifth most common cancer in the country. These higher rates are tied to trends for tanned skin and the rise of cheap holidays in the sun. Despite the surge in cases, skin cancer-related deaths are decreasing due to early diagnosis and treatment.13. SwedenSkin cancer incidence rate: 40.8Sweden experiences a high incidence of skin cancer, with almost 4,266 new annual melanoma diagnoses and 562 fatalities in 2020, driven by the population's affinity for sun exposure during travel and the use of tanning beds. Despite being well-informed about the risks, the appeal of tanning often outweighs future health warnings among Swedes.12. NorwaySkin cancer incidence rate: 41.7Norway's melanoma cases increased significantly in 2022, with 2,911 diagnoses, 468 more than the previous year. The most significant growth was observed among the elderly. Norway leads globally in both melanoma cases and related deaths, largely linked to sun exposure and sunbed usage.11. LuxembourgSkin cancer incidence rate: 42.8Skin cancer is one of the five major cancers in Luxembourg, followed by cancers of the breast, prostate, lung, and colorectum. In 2020 alone, approximately 144 new instances of melanoma were identified, leading to 18 unfortunate fatalities.10. BelgiumSkin cancer incidence rate: 45.0In the year 2020, Belgium experienced a significant number of new melanoma diagnoses, with a total of 3,372 cases. These cases resulted in 413 fatalities. Notably, melanoma is the fourth most prevalent cancer among Belgian women, accounting for a consequential 5% of all female cancer cases.9. DenmarkSkin cancer incidence rate: 45.9In 2020, Denmark recorded 2,886 new melanoma skin cancer cases, with a death number of 341 per 100,000 population. The country sees an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), especially among outdoor workers who face 1.6 times the risk compared to indoor workers.8. GermanySkin cancer incidence rate: 51.8In 2020, Germany experienced a significant incidence of melanoma, with 17,260 new cases in males and 14,208 cases in females. In total, 31,468 individuals were affected by melanoma. Factors such as regional UV radiation levels, sunshine hours, and sociodemographic characteristics are considered to significantly influence the prevalence of skin cancer in the country.7. The NetherlandsSkin cancer incidence rate: 61.5Melanoma is the fourth most common cancer in Dutch men and women, with 8,310 new cases diagnosed and 906 deaths as a result in 2020. Many skin cancer patients in the Netherlands develop multiple skin tumors. Research reveals that 1 in 6 Dutch people will develop skin cancer in their lifetime and 1 in 50 will develop a melanoma.6. IrelandSkin cancer incidence rate: 63.3Ireland ranks sixth when it comes to the countries with the highest rates of skin cancer. In Ireland, over 1,1316 new skin cancer cases were diagnosed in 2020, leading to 181 deaths as a result. Most skin cancer-related mortalities in Ireland are due to outdoor work, such as construction, farming, and fishing. Prolonged exposure to UV radiation and sunlight without proper protection is considered a major reason for causing skin cancer in Irish people.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Countries with the Highest Rates of Skin Cancer.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis pharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -158.3%.Revenues are expected to be $14.37 billion, down 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.95% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Merck?For Merck, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -66.44%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Merck will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Merck would post earnings of $1.34 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.40, delivering a surprise of +4.48%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release.

229,05463ff9-395c-3c91-bc1f-8f13828a0ffd,BA,2023-07-26,Boeing loses $149 million in Q2 as it pushes ahead with production increases,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-loses-149-million-q2-115650408.html,1690372610,STORY,"['BA', 'AIR.PA']","[Boeing flipped to a $149 million loss in the second quarter despite higher revenue, as the plane maker struggled with higher costs in both its airline and defense business.The company beat Wall Street expectations for profit, revenue and free cash flow and said it is beginning to increase production of its two most popular airline planes.The shares jumped 8.7% on Wednesday — the biggest one-day percentage gain in more than a year.European rival Airbus reported a second-quarter profit and also said it was making progress to raise production of its best-selling plane. Airbus said a new problem with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines will not affect its assembly lines.Boeing plans to raise production of the 737 Max from 31 to 38 planes a month and boost output of the larger, two-aisle 787 Dreamliner from four to five per month by year end.The world's two leading aircraft manufacturers are benefitting as travel recovers from the pandemic and airlines place huge orders for newer, more fuel-efficient planes.“We have more work ahead to improve performance, but our progress is clear and we’re confident in our path forward.” CEO David Calhoun said in a memo to employees. He said the company was improving the stability of operations in its factories and among suppliers.Boeing, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, has been beset by supply-chain problems that continued during the second quarter, including a temporary delay in 737 deliveries because of fittings on the Max and regulators’ questions about Dreamliner inspections.Boeing said the commercial-planes division was weighed down by “abnormal costs,” which it did not detail. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen, said those were likely the result of fixing issues with fuel tanks on the Boeing 767 and fuselage fittings on the Dreamliner.The defense and space business also performed worse than analysts expected. Von Rumohr called it “disappointingly still in the red,"" partly due to write-downs on several programs.Story continuesThe company recorded charges of $257 million related to a delay in launches of its Starliner reusable space vehicle, $189 million for higher than expected production costs for a military training jet, and $68 million for delays in a defense refueling drone.Boeing's loss compared with net income of $160 million a year earlier and, excluding unusual items, amounted to 82 cents per share. Analysts expected a loss of 89 cents per share, according to a FactSet survey.Revenue rose 18% to $19.75 billion, more than the $18.59 billion that analysts expected. Sales were boosted by an increase in delivery of commercial planes to airlines and lessors.Airbus said net income attributable to shareholders were 1.06 billion euros ($1.17 billion) in the quarter, or 1.34 euros ($1.48) per share. Revenue was 15.9 billion euros ($17.6 billion) .Analysts expected 1.55 euros per share on revenue of 15.85 billion euros, according to FactSet.Like Boeing, Airbus said it was making progress toward raising production of its A320neo-family of jets – they compete with the Max -- to 75 jets a month in 2026.However this week, it was revealed that hundreds of Airbus passenger jets will need to have their engines removed and inspected in the coming months after engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney discovered a problem with powder metal used in making parts for 1,200 engines.Nearly 800 A320 and A321s have the affected Pratt engines, according to aviation-data firm Cirium. Indian low-cost airline IndiGo has nearly 140. Among U.S. carriers, Spirit Airlines has 34 of the planes, Hawaiian Airlines 18 and JetBlue Airways 16.Pratt parent RTX Corp. said this week that the issue does not affect new engines, and Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said Wednesday that Pratt has confirmed it can meet Airbus' demand for engines despite the inspections of hundreds of ones already in use.Shares of Boeing Co. rose $18.68, its biggest nominal one-day gain since November 2020, to close at $232.80.]"

This development marks a crucial step in ensuring nuclear safety and quality standards for Vogtle Unit 4. It has garnered the attention of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the energy industry as a whole.Completion of ITAACs and NRC AssuranceGeorgia Power, in collaboration with Southern Nuclear, has industriously worked to complete all the Inspections, Tests, Analyses and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC) for Vogtle Unit 4 as required by Southern Nuclear's Combined Operating License.The ITAAC process involves rigorous examinations, tests and investigations to ensure the facility's construction and operations are in line with the regulatory standards. These ITAACs collectively provide assurance to the NRC that the Vogtle Unit 4 meets strict nuclear safety and quality standards, an essential aspect of operating a nuclear facility. Per the NRC guidelines, each ITAAC closure notice must be verified before the fuel load can proceed.Awaiting the 103(g) Finding From the NRCWith the completion of the ITAACs, Georgia Power now anticipates to receive the 103(g) finding from the NRC. This finding is a critical requirement for Unit 4's operation, as it confirms that the new unit has been constructed and will be operated in compliance with the Combined License and NRC regulations.Southern Nuclear will be able to load fuel and initiate the startup sequence for Vogtle Unit 4 only on receiving the 103(g) finding. This finding essentially signifies NRC's confidence in the facility's adherence to safety and quality protocols, allowing the unit to proceed toward commercial operation.Fuel Load and Startup PreparationsMeticulous preparations are underway as Georgia Power’s team at the Vogtle site gears up for Unit 4's fuel load and startup. All 157 fuel assemblies required for the operation of the Unit 4 reactor have been safely delivered to the site. These assemblies, each measuring 14 feet tall, underwent inspection and were transferred to new fuel storage racks before being placed into the spent fuel pool.Story continuesThis fuel pool will serve as a temporary storage location for all fuel assemblies until they are ready to be loaded into the Unit 4 reactor during the fuel loading process. This careful handling and storage procedure ensures all safety and operational measures are met before the reactor can be fully operational.A Bright Future for Georgia Power and Its CustomersThe new Vogtle units, once operational, will play a vital role in fulfilling Georgia Power's commitment to providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its extensive customer base. Each of the new units is expected to generate enough electricity to power approximately 500,000 homes and businesses.The co-owners, Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities will use Southern Nuclear to manage the new units. These companies have joined hands in the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions, emphasizing the importance of nuclear power in the United States’ energy mix.The Significance of Nuclear Energy in a Clean Energy FutureAs the world transitions to a more sustainable energy future, nuclear power stands out as a reliable, low-carbon energy source with a track record of safe and efficient operations. Nuclear power plants, like Vogtle Units 3 &amp; 4, emit minimal greenhouse gases, making them valuable contributors to reducing carbon emissions and combating climate change.Countries across the globe are exploring ways to decarbonize their energy systems and nuclear power remains a crucial option in the clean energy mix.ConclusionThe recent completion of all ITAACs and the pending 103(g) finding from the NRC mark crucial steps in the journey toward commercial operation for Vogtle Unit 4. Georgia Power's commitment to nuclear safety and quality standard demonstrates the utility's dedication to its customers and the environment.Georgia Power and its co-owners reaffirm their role in leading the movement toward a sustainable energy future. The Vogtle 3 &amp; 4 nuclear expansion site stands as an example of progress, showcasing the potential of nuclear energy in powering a greener world.Zacks Rank and Key PicksSO is an American utility firm that provides electricity to customers across southern United States.

(AP) — A federal lawsuit alleges that health insurance giant Cigna used a computer algorithm to automatically reject hundreds of thousands of patient claims without examining them individually as required by California law.The class-action lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court in Sacramento, says Cigna Corp. and Cigna Health and Life Insurance Co. rejected more than 300,000 payment claims in just two months last year.The company used an algorithm called PXDX, shorthand for ''procedure-to-diagnosis,"" to identify whether claims met certain requirements, spending an average of just 1.2 seconds on each review, according to the lawsuit. Huge batches of claims were then sent on to doctors who signed off on the denials, the lawsuit said.“Relying on the PXDX system, Cigna’s doctors instantly reject claims on medical grounds without ever opening patient files, leaving thousands of patients effectively without coverage and with unexpected bills,” according to the lawsuit.Ultimately, Cigna conducted an “illegal scheme to systematically, wrongfully and automatically” deny members claims to avoid paying for medical necessary procedures, the lawsuit contends.Connecticut-based Cigna has 18 million U.S. members, including more than 2 million in California.The lawsuit was filed on behalf of two Cigna members in Placer and San Diego counties who were forced to pay for tests after Cigna denied their claims.The lawsuit accuses Cigna of violating California's requirement that it conduct “thorough, fair, and objective” investigations of bills submitted for medical expenses. It seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial.Cigna “utilizes the PXDX system because it knows it will not be held accountable for wrongful denials"" because only a small fraction of policyholders appeal denied claims, according to the lawsuit.In a statement, Cigna Healthcare said the lawsuit “appears highly questionable and seems to be based entirely on a poorly reported article that skewed the facts.”The company says the process is used to speed up payments to physicians for common, relatively inexpensive procedures through an industry-standard review process similar to those used by other insurers for years.“Cigna uses technology to verify that the codes on some of the most common, low-cost procedures are submitted correctly based on our publicly available coverage policies, and this is done to help expedite physician reimbursement,” the statement said. “The review takes place after patients have received treatment, so it does not result in any denials of care. If codes are submitted incorrectly, we provide clear guidance on resubmission and how to appeal.”]"

These non-GAAP financial measures provide supplemental information and should not be considered replacements for results in accordance with GAAP. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our company. We believe these measures provide meaningful information to us and investors because they enhance the understanding of our operating performance, ability to generate cash, and the trends of our business. Additionally, we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating our operations. The primary limitation of these measures is that they exclude the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using these non-GAAP financial measures in combination with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.The following provides additional information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures:Organic Net Sales Growth (Decline) – represents net sales growth (decline) (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic Net Sales Growth (Decline) is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. This measure is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin – represent operating income and operating margin, respectively, (the most comparable GAAP financial measures) before special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill, and other income or charges, if any. We utilize these adjusted measures in combination with operating income and operating margin to assess segment level operating performance and to provide insight to management in evaluating segment operating plan execution and market conditions. Adjusted Operating Income is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.Adjusted Other Income (Expense), Net – represents net other income (expense) (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) before special items including tax sharing income related to adjustments to prior period tax returns and other items, if any.Adjusted Income Tax (Expense) Benefit and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate – represent income tax (expense) benefit and effective tax rate, respectively, (the most comparable GAAP financial measures) after adjusting for the tax effect of special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill, other income or charges, and certain significant tax items, if any.Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations – represents income from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) before special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill, tax sharing income related to adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, other income or charges, and certain significant tax items, if any, and, if applicable, the related tax effects.Adjusted Earnings Per Share – represents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) before special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill, tax sharing income related to adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, other income or charges, and certain significant tax items, if any, and, if applicable, the related tax effects. This measure is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.Free Cash Flow (FCF) – is a useful measure of our ability to generate cash. The difference between net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) and Free Cash Flow consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify. We believe Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities excluding voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items, if any, minus net capital expenditures. Voluntary pension contributions are excluded from the GAAP financial measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. Certain special items, including net payments related to pre-separation tax matters and cash paid (collected) pursuant to collateral requirements related to cross-currency swap contracts, are also excluded by management in evaluating Free Cash Flow. Net capital expenditures consist of capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. These items are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments. In the calculation of Free Cash Flow, we subtract certain cash items that are ultimately within management's and the Board of Directors' discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable GAAP financial measure indicates. It should not be inferred that the entire Free Cash Flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures, as our definition of Free Cash Flow does not consider certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as debt payments. In addition, we may have other discretionary expenditures, such as discretionary dividends, share repurchases, and business acquisitions, that are not considered in the calculation of Free Cash Flow.Forward-Looking StatementsThis release contains certain ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainty and changes in circumstances, which may cause actual results, performance, financial condition or achievements to differ materially from anticipated results, performance, financial condition or achievements. All statements contained herein that are not clearly historical in nature are forward-looking and the words ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have no intention and are under no obligation to update or alter (and expressly disclaim any such intention or obligation to do so) our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by law. The forward-looking statements in this release include statements addressing our future financial condition and operating results, and the impact on our operations resulting from the coronavirus disease 2019 (""COVID-19""). Examples of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the extent, severity and duration of COVID-19 negatively affecting our business operations; business, economic, competitive and regulatory risks, such as conditions affecting demand for products in the automotive and other industries we serve; competition and pricing pressure; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices; natural disasters and political, economic and military instability in countries in which we operate, including continuing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine or escalating tensions in surrounding countries; developments in the credit markets; future goodwill impairment; compliance with current and future environmental and other laws and regulations; and the possible effects on us of changes in tax laws, tax treaties and other legislation, including the effects of Swiss tax reform. In addition, the extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Such developments may include the geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, the impact on our suppliers' and customers' supply chains, the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak in jurisdictions in which we operate, and the possible impact on the global economy and local economies in which we operate.  More detailed information about these and other factors is set forth in TE Connectivity Ltd.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Sept 30, 2022, as well as in our Quarterly

American Banker Staff Writer Kyle Campbell sits down with Yahoo Finance Live to explain the ways in which these guidelines will mitigate risk differently for various forms of credit lending. Campbell describes how these new guidelines will impact certain larger, institutional banks, while examining the exposure regional banks may have to commercial real estate.Video Transcript- All right. On Thursday, just one day after the FOMC's latest interest rate decision, Federal Reserve will unveil a proposal for new bank capital requirements. The proposed rule would also lower the threshold for qualifying banks, meaning smaller institutions will face a new host of demands previously avoided.Fed vice chair for supervision, Michael Barr, outlined a sweeping plan to overhaul bank oversight requirements earlier this month. The proposal, set to come out Thursday, will offer more specifics on just how significant those changes could be.Joining us now with the latest is Kyle Campbell, staff writer at American Banker. Kyle, good to see you here. I talked to Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, about this. He really took a-- I would say, a hard line view of this. This could really be impactful to the economy. What have you been hearing from sources?KYLE CAMPBELL: Yeah, I mean, that's the big concern, right. Banks have been looking forward to this proposal for a long time now. Since 2017 is when the Basel III, they call it endgame, was first finalized, sort of, internationally, and now we're implementing that.Where this is-- what we're going to see on Thursday is just how that's going to impact the economy because we're going to find out which particular activities are going to be given which sort of risk weights under the new framework. So if, let's say, auto lending comes with a much heavier capital penalty, than a lot of banks are sort of forecasting with their internal models currently. It's going to make that type of financing more expensive, essentially.Story continuesAnd there is a view that as capital overall increases, it's just going to have a broader, sort of, tightening impact on the availability of credit broadly in the economy.- Is it really? Or is it just that their margins are going to get smaller? Or both, right?KYLE CAMPBELL: I think it's probably a bit of both but that's a great question. And certainly, consumer advocates are saying, well, look, the way that capital is raised is it's just hurting the bottom line for executives. You just have to retained earnings and you lose that sort of ROE, return on equity, that is what sort of fuels bank profits.So it's certainly going to result in less profitability, at least for some period of time. And again, how that actually impacts the availability of credit to the average person is going to really, I think-- I don't think it's particularly useful to try to forecast the overall picture, but you can get a good sense of how individual banks are going to be impacted by this once we see the specifics on Thursday.- For those banks, let's say a Wells Fargo, that have been struggling for some time, what does this mean for the struggling banks like a Wells Fargo?KYLE CAMPBELL: Wells Fargo, it'll be interesting. I mean, obviously if-- I mean, they've started to sort of move away from mortgages, which is one area where there's going to be a lot of focus. What happens to mortgages. You know, how does it get treated under the capital rules.I mean-- I think that where it's going to be more impactful than at Wells Fargo-- I mean, certainly they're going to be hit to some degree. But I think it's really going to be most impactful on the sort of mid-size banks, if you will. The ones that were in that sort of 100 billion to 250 billion asset range, that are now going to be facing these capital-- these sort of risk capital requirements for the first time.I think the large banks sort of know how to deal with these sort of requirements. And I don't think that a Wells Fargo is going to be as impacted, on a relative basis, as some of the smaller banks.- Let's turn to another issue that the market's been paying a lot of attention to, and that's commercial real estate and the risks associated with commercial real estate. In these earnings reports that we've gotten from banks, several of them announced steps to anticipate losses. To put aside money for losses, potential losses in commercial real estate.Wells Fargo, for example, boosted its allowance for credit losses. So where are we in that sort of situation?KYLE CAMPBELL: Yeah, that's a great question. And certainly, regulators are very focused on commercial real estate, giving some strong warnings to banks to do things like set aside losses and sort of avoid getting new exposures where you can avoid it.And that actually kind of compounds the issue because a lot of these-- I mean, certainly with offices, we know, the ones that are vacant, not getting people in, and that's sort of a whole issue unto itself. But there are some assets where they're kind of performing relatively well but they're going to need some kind of a recapitalization in order to remain viable and not end up as a foreclosure. And in order to do that, you need banks to sort come to the table.So I think what we're going to be looking for is who's going to move first. Are we going to see some of these sort of big capital equity investors, private equity funds, start to come in and say, hey, we're going to move in in a higher equity basis? Or are we going to see some banks say, hey, actually, we're going to be willing to back some of these recap-type strategies through lending?- Is this a potentially destabilizing event for the banking sector?KYLE CAMPBELL: I wouldn't think so.- I'm trying to compare it to what happened earlier this year.KYLE CAMPBELL: Right. Yeah. I mean, I think you're going to see some serious stress. And I wouldn't be surprised if at specific banks, you see some possible failures. I mean, you don't want to throw that term around too lightly. But yeah, it's possible that some banks could either have to be sold or go through some sort of an M&amp;A activity to sort of right the ship here.I wouldn't expect it to get to a level where we're needing to see serious intervention by the government because they're sort of very well aware of what's going on in real time. But these things can snowball pretty quickly. So yeah, it could be something to watch for sure.- Yeah, most definitely. Kyle, thanks for coming in. Good to see you.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -70.6%.Revenues are expected to be $13.89 billion, down 49.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.24% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Pfizer?For Pfizer, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.98%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Pfizer will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Pfizer would post earnings of $1 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.23, delivering a surprise of +23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Pfizer doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAbbVie (ABBV), another stock in the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $2.82 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -16.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $13.52 billion, down 7.3% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for AbbVie has been revised 0.2% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.26%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AbbVie will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

253,16f77405-22f8-3bb9-8c0d-2cc5dea70ba5,PFE,2023-07-26,Pfizer and Moderna’s parent are investing $100 million in a new partnership to find the next big drug,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-moderna-parent-investing-100-095037312.html,1690278637,STORY,"['PFE', 'MRNA']","[Good morning.I took note last week when Pfizer and Flagship Pioneering, parent of Moderna, announced they were teaming up in a “novel agreement” to create a pipeline of innovative medicines. The two companies proved their commitment to rapid innovation during the pandemic, when they both developed new vaccines in record time, so I felt their $100 million deal deserved extra attention. I spoke yesterday with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and Flagship CEO Noubar Afeyan and asked them: What makes this agreement “novel”? Here’s Afeyan:“Flagship is strong in a number of things. It makes these scientific leaps, it makes platforms that haven’t existed in the past, and it creates the potential for many products. And, of course, Pfizer has a long history and a very strong current capability of taking products and applying them to meet unmet needs, developing them and then commercializing them. Historically these things have happened quite separately, and the only time they meet is when there is some product [that] has success in clinical trials, and then people do partnerships. Here, what we are thinking about is if you have enough of a long-term view, and you can actually think about up to 10 products coming out of this work, then you can think about coexisting and collaborating as an alliance, as opposed to a one-off partnership. That’s what I think is novel…the points of connection can be many and there can be a lot of learning of how to do this, in a best of class way.”Here’s Bourla:“Let’s take a step back to how I see the research environment developing. It’s very different today than 10 or 15 years ago, and it is driven by the tremendous proliferation of scientific knowledge. Ten or 15 years ago, the number of biological targets that we knew of were relatively manageable, and the number of modalities we had to go after them was also manageable. In that environment, it made sense for very big companies like Pfizer to place singular bets…But now, for every unmet medical need, there is so much knowledge about biological targets, and the modalities to go after them are so, so big that it’s impossible for anyone to place a singular bet…What is unique with Flagship is they have 40 different companies under one umbrella and most of them are organized around a technology…like Moderna and mRNA. We can put together our brains and say let’s try to find a way to meet unmet medical needs.” Story continuesBourla and Afeyan said they began talking about this new approach in the depths of the pandemic, when they were “partners-slash-competitors,” as Bourla puts it, in the effort to create a vaccine. Will their partnership lead to a new model for drug development that accelerates medical innovation? Here’s Afeyan again:“Every new thing is kind of a voyage. But there is a big impact prize at the end of this, and a willingness to learn, and the patience it takes to create an alignment…Our hope here is that both of us have an institutional patience and the resources to do some early iterations until we get this right….It is a new model in the life sciences.”Adds Bourla:“You can’t find partnerships of pharma and biotech companies in the early exploratory phases right now. Its only when a product has demonstrated significant chances of success that the two can join resources. What we are doing now, I don’t think anyone has done so far.”Given the track record of these two leaders, this one is certainly worth watching.Separately this morning, be sure to read Jeremy Kahn’s brilliant Fortune story on the $160 billion threat that generative A.I. poses for Google, and how the tech giant is responding.

Paypal (PYPL), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This technology platform and digital payments company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 4.85%.For the last reported quarter, Paypal came out with earnings of $1.17 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 per share, representing a surprise of 6.36%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.20 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.24 per share, delivering a surprise of 3.33%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Paypal lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Paypal currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.12%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on August 2, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.56 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -57%.Revenues are expected to be $31.02 billion, down 42.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.82% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marathon Petroleum?For Marathon Petroleum, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.15%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marathon Petroleum will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Marathon Petroleum would post earnings of $5.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.09, delivering a surprise of +6.10%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

The company is expected to deliver sales and earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.32 per share, indicating a 9.1% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. For fiscal fourth-quarter revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $19.93 billion, suggesting a 2.1% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.In the last reported quarter, the company recorded an earnings surprise of 3.79%. It has delivered a bottom-line beat of 1.02%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Procter &amp; Gamble Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Procter &amp; Gamble Company (The) price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Procter &amp; Gamble Company (The) QuoteKey Factors to NoteProcter &amp; Gamble has been demonstrating its dominance in the global market by strategically leveraging its brand strength to drive organic sales growth. As a manufacturer of products catering to the essential daily needs of consumers worldwide, P&amp;G's success in the preceding quarters can be attributed to its robust brand portfolio and effective business strategies. The persistence of these trends is expected to get reflected in the company’s organic sales for the fiscal fourth quarter.We expect organic sales to increase 5.2% in the to-be-reported quarter. Organic sales are expected to increase 7% for the Beauty segment, 5% for Grooming, 5% for Fabric &amp; Home Care, 8% for Health Care, and 3% for the Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segment.P&amp;G has been diligently pursuing cost-saving and productivity measures to drive margins and reinforce its competitive advantage. The company's commitment to enhancing productivity, while mitigating macro cost headwinds has been integral to maintaining a balanced top and bottom-line growth.We expect P&amp;G's gross margin for the fiscal fourth quarter to have been influenced by significant productivity savings. Our model predicts a gross margin expansion of 50 bps for the to-be-reported quarter. However, currency headwinds are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Rising input costs are expected to have weighed on the fiscal fourth-quarter performance. Our estimate indicates a 4% impact from currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company anticipated year-over-year all-in sales growth of 1% for fiscal 2023, with organic sales likely to increase 6%. The company expects currency movements to negatively impact all-in sales growth by 5%.Management predicted reported EPS to be flat to up 4% from the $5.81 posted in fiscal 2022. The company expects EPS to be at the low end of the above-mentioned range due to the ongoing commodity and material cost headwinds, and currency impacts.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Procter &amp; Gamble this time around.

Many others are involuntarily ceding market share to traditional auto giants like Ford, Chevy and GM.Tesla alone is turning a profit, making this a longer-term game for the smaller producers, which are now struggling in an environment of high-interest rates and consumers too squeamish about going for car loans.Add to this a price war, and the EV playing field becomes a risker venue for investors.Still, the smart money knows that the energy transition is a must for a sound investment portfolio going forward, and the EV industry is one of the most obvious places to park your dollars.In this sea of uncertainty, then, we’re looking for stocks along the supply chain that have carved out a niche among the competition and aren’t drowning in debt.In this case, with global investment in the low-carbon energy transition hitting a record $1.1 trillion, reaching parity with fossil fuel capital deployment for the first time last year, we’re looking to China's most exciting EVmaker… to a first-mover in the burgeoning electric boating industry … and to a chip-maker that has captivated the auto industry.#1 Building Your EV Dreams:BYD (OTCMKTS: BYDDY)Let’s start with the biggest and most expensive of the three–Chinese BYD (Build Your Dreams), which will be on the radar of some investors if only because it was backed by Warren Buffett but should be considered a high-growth potential stock.For now, BYD is largely for the Chinese market, but international expansion plans are well underway.In 2022, BYD sold over 1.85 million electric cars and hybrids, and which comes after the previous year in which the Chinese EV darling tripled sales.In the first quarter of this year, BYD reported a 93% increase in sales, and going forward, investors should be looking at its new Seagull EV–a mini car intended for city driving at an affordable price.In total, BYD–the largest EV producer in China–has more than 300 domestic brands, and they’re doing well amid a cut-throat pricing war. While they haven’t penetrated the U.S. market yet, people are buying them in Europe and Asia, and in a price war, everything matters.Story continuesSo, what about Buffett?Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has been winding down its position in BYD over the course of the past year. Buffett now holds less than 10% of the company (less than half it used to hold) but had spent previous years praising it. No one knows why he’s been withdrawing from BYD other than a vague statement about not wanting to compete with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).It is understandable to take that statement as a negative indicator; however, what it really says is that BYD is an actual competitor against Tesla–a competition it may lose, but a stock that is even considered in the rankings with Tesla should be capable of earning investors some decent returns along the way. And in reality, what Buffett may more likely be doing is cashing in on BYD profits and investing them elsewhere, which has nothing to do with Tesla.Another factor to consider is geopolitical, in which case BYD does carry some risk. Buffett was dumping shares amid high-level tensions between Washington and Beijing over Taiwan. China stocks are always risky, but if BYD gets a real foothold in international markets, nothing will stop it.Year-to-date, BYD stock is up over 30%, having recovered from Buffett’s share-dumping.Don’t Forget About Boats, and Look for First-Mover AdvantageVision Marine Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:VMAR)The EV race isn’t just unfolding on the pavement … it’s very much seaborne, too, and VMAR is set to collect its first revenues from its proprietary PowerTrain battery technology this year.The $12-billion boat battery battle is all about first-mover advantage, which in this case appears to go to VMAR, the boating tech company that has successfully developed the world’s most powerful marine electric powertrain (motor).Vision Marine debuted its E-Motion 180 HP electric outboard motor with its proprietary PowerTrain technology in February and recently launched the new H2e Bowrider in partnership with Four Winns. Together, they have produced the H2e Bowrider, the first all-electric series production bowrider on the market.The E-Motion is the first fully electric, production-ready, high-performance 180 HP, which makes it the key market disruptor. With its proprietary technology, which includes the batteries, the engine and the software, Vision Marine’s E-Motion is now the only turn-key solution for boat manufacturers in its class. That’s a strong first-mover position to be in at the critical junction of a high-dollar energy transition.Vision Marine’s (NASDAQ:VMAR) business plan is to market its E-Motion Powertrain to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) rather than the public, and they have already received advance orders from Four Winns.And investors are poised to see the company collect its first revenues from the PowerTrain battery technology this year.The revenues don’t stop here, either. VMAR is also hitting up the $5-billion+ boat rental market, which it plans to flip fully electric. Its flagship electric boat rental outfit in Newport is annualizing $4 million in revenues with a 35% profit margin, according to the company, and now it's working to rapidly expand, rolling out two more locations this year and launching a franchise model.By 2024, it’s full speed ahead with scaling. By the end of 2024, Vision Marine expects to be free cash-flow positive, and by 2025, it expects to have two profitable and growing divisions, after which the scaling will pick up the pace even faster.The team has taken VMAR from a private company to a NASDAQ listing, successfully raising capital to develop the company’s proprietary technology and commercialize it, earning it the moniker “Tesla of the Sea”.This is definitely one to watch as the electric summer unfolds.#3 A Rapid-Growth ChipmakerAllegro MicroSystems (ALGM)New Hampshire-based Allegro not only manufactures its own chips … but it also produces its own battery, which has meant some pretty impressive growth, and this may be a good ‘buy-on-the-dip’ opportunity after a recent pullback.This chipmaker is not fully dependent on the auto industry, or even the EV segment, which makes it slightly more insulated from EV ups and downs. Last year, nearly 70% of its sales, though, were to the auto industry.Allegro produces magnetic sensing and power management chips, which can be used for EVs or for advanced safety features in ICE vehicles.Year-to-date, Allegro is up an impressive 68%, and its key growth segments are e-Mobility and Clean Energy &amp; Automation, both of which have grown faster than expected, with profit margins continually improving. Since its IPO in October 2020, Allegro has gained over 180%, outperforming the SPDR S&amp;P Semiconductor ETF (XSD), which only gained 45% in that same time period.Other companies to keep an eye on:General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), a stalwart of the American automotive industry, has been making determined strides towards an all-electric future.

Yahoo Finance Live discusses the company's 'Next-Gen' Chevy Bolt EV and what it means for the electric vehicle market.Video Transcript- And Praz, I want to start with you, because you're looking at an EV car that's back from the dead.- The Bolt is back. The Bolt--- --is three months after.- Yeah.- It was a short death. It was a short death.- Yeah, yeah. So today on the GM, Earnings called Mary Barra, and the beginning of the call said that the Chevy Bolt EV, which they said was ending production last quarter, is now coming back as a Next Gen model. Next Gen, by the way, is a corporate buzzword, which we will get to later. Anyway, they call--- So excited.- It's called the Next Gen Bolt EV. It's going to come back. Like I said, it's going to be powered by the Ultium battery platform, which is, according to GM, going to be a cheaper platform for them to build on. The new car I imagine will likely be in that same $30,000-ish price range, because that's where the Bolt made its money, right? It is a cheap EV for the masses, and GM sold more than they ever have in the last two quarters. So it was surprising to see it go, but I'm not surprised to see it come back.- What's interesting to me is the number that GM threw out, which is 70% of drivers who trade in a vehicle to get the Bolt traded a non GM vehicle. At the end of the day, when you think about the EV transition, it is about GM trying to appeal to a wider, wider swath, right? We're at 5% market share right now in terms of new buyers, EV sales. GM is the name, as well as Ford, that's supposed to get it to a much wider spectrum. So not only is it people who are buying in on GM who usually wouldn't, it's also the price point. And that's why it's interesting that just three months after the fact, they're bringing it back.- Yeah. And what do you think the price point will mean for a company like Tesla, especially since we're seeing these pricing wars occur. I'm curious, does Tesla have any price stock reaction after the news broke with GM?Story continues- I didn't see any reaction to that. I know that the Model 3, if you include the federal tax credit, is like 33,000.- Well, I mean, that's the key, right?- So that's competing in that same class. And right now I think GM thinks that if they need to compete against the Tesla Model 3, they've got to make the Bolt better, and that might include that Ultium platform.- And we're talking about $7,500 tax credit. That's federal. But if you've got states, which I always like to bring up, because in California, it's $7,500 on top of that. I mean, that is a steep discount when you think about a Model 3. Which is why you see them everywhere in California, and many other states too, right?So GM is going into that market trying to compete. It is about a lower price point. And I'm curious, if we're talking 5%, to get to 10%, where is that market. Is it in sort of these trucks, the F-150 Lightning, these other trucks that are selling at a higher price point, or is it on the lower end, from drivers who are saying, I don't want to be paying gas prices, but I also don't have $70,000 to buy a new car.- I think if we're going to get even past 10%, it's got to be at that lower end, the middle class buyer that wants to go into electrics when right now they're being priced out. They don't have many options, aside from the Bolt, which they're getting rid of, right? So that's going to come online. I think--- --the Leaf. You forgot about the Leaf. [LAUGHS]- With the Leaf, I don't think it's competitive in terms of range. But I think you're right. I think trucks too. Because trucks are such a huge-- The biggest market in America is trucks. If you can make those trucks cheaper and good range, that's what it is.- I mean, we're seeing EV adoption pick up across the board. So I'm very curious to see the sales for those Bolts.- Yeah.]"

It has also promised improvements to its internet search product by adding new machine learning features.Chief executive Sundar Pichai, who was yesterday visiting the UK to discuss AI with Government officials, said: “Our continued leadership in AI and our excellence in engineering and innovation are driving the next evolution of search, and improving all our services.”While hundreds of businesses have raced to include elements of ChatGPT’s technology in their work, general interest has flagged. The number of visitors to OpenAI’s ChatGPT site fell for the first time in June, down 10pc.Alphabet shares ticked up 6.6pc in after hours trading on Tuesday night.

This was a regrettable error of judgement on her part. The events will be taken into account in decisions on remuneration at the appropriate time.However, after careful reflection the Board has concluded that it retains full confidence in Ms Rose as CEO of the bank.She has proved, over the last 4 years to be an outstanding leader of the institution, as demonstrated by our results. The Board therefore believes it is clearly in the interest of all the bank’s shareholders and customers that she continues in post.The Board is clear that the overall handling of the circumstances surrounding Mr Farage accounts has been unsatisfactory, with serious consequences for the bank. The Board will commission an independent review into the account closure arrangement at Coutts, and the lessons to be learnt from this.The findings of that review will be made public on completion. The Terms of Reference and lead firm will be announced shortly.06:23 PM BSTAn interesting earnings call awaits...NatWest’s half year financial results are out tomorrow morning, as Nigel Farage pointed out this afternoon:NatWest half yearly results due on Friday morning at 7am, followed by an investor presentation.

Given the consequences of this, I want to address the questions that have been raised and set out the substance of the conversations that took place.Believing it was public knowledge, I confirmed that Mr Farage was a Coutts customer and that he had been offered a NatWest bank account. Alongside this, I repeated what Mr Farage had already stated, that the bank saw this as a commercial decision. I would like to emphasise that in responding to Mr Jack’s questions I did not reveal any personal financial information about Mr Farage.In response to a general question about eligibility criteria required to bank with Coutts and NatWest I said that guidance on both was publicly available on their websites. In doing so, I recognise that I left Mr Jack with the impression that the decision to close Mr Farage’s accounts was solely a commercial one.I was not part of the decision-making process to exit Mr Farage. This decision was made by Coutts, and I was informed in April that this was for commercial reasons.  At the time of my conversations with Mr Jack, I was not in receipt of the contents of the Coutts Wealth Reputational Risk Committee materials subsequently released by Mr Farage. I have apologised to Mr Farage for the deeply inappropriate language contained in those papers and the Board has commissioned a full independent review into the decision and process to ensure that this cannot happen again.Put simply, I was wrong to respond to any question raised by the BBC about this case. I want to extend my sincere apologies to Mr Farage for the personal hurt this has caused him and I have written to him today.I would like to say sorry to the Board and my colleagues.  I started my career working for National Westminster Bank. It is an institution I care about enormously and have always been proud to be a part of. It has been the privilege of my career to lead the bank and I am grateful to the Board for entrusting me with this role. It is therefore all the more regrettable that my actions have compounded an already difficult issue for the Group.06:03 PM BSTBREAKING: Alison Rose admits leaking confidential information about Nigel FarageNatWest chief executive Alison Rose has finally conceded she discussed private details about Nigel Farage’s bank account with a BBC journalist.The Telegraph’s chief reporter Robert Mendick writes:In a statement, Dame Alison Rose said she was the source of the story and admitted “a serious error of judgment” in briefing the BBC.But she claimed she thought the information was already in the public domain in a desprate attempt to cling on to her job.Dame Alison said: “I recognise that in my conversations with Simon Jack of the BBC, I made a serious error of judgment in discussing Mr Farage’s relationship with the bank.“Given the consequences of this, I want to address the questions that have been raised and set out the substance of the conversations that took place.”The bank’s chairman Sir Howard Davies said he was standing by her.“This was a regrettable error of judgement on her part.

The publisher, which targets left-leaning readers in the US and Australia, is now seeking expansion on the Continent.A new European edition of its website with a dedicated staff is scheduled for launch in autumn.It meant overall turnover rose 3pc to £264m. However, the Guardian recorded a £21m cash outflow as it invested more in editorial teams, newsletters and podcasts.The company did not disclose the financial impact of a cyber attack late last year that exposed employees’ personal details and forced many staff members to work from home for months.05:02 PM BSTWickes eyes return of DIY buyingWickes has launched a £25m share buyback as it hailed signs of a coming recovery for DIY sales.The home improvement chain said DIY sales were showing an “improving trend”, although they remained lower year-on-year.The retailer, which also provides goods for builders, posted a 3pc rise in like-for-like sales in the three months ending in June as trade sales offset the ongoing dip in DIY revenues.Profits in the sector have slumped following a boom during the pandemic while the cost-of-living crisis and inflation have piled pressure on all retailers.Pleasant weather helped boost outdoor sales for Wickes, marking a turnaround after sales fell by 1.8pc during the first quarter of the year.Shares in Wickes climbed 6.5pc to 135 pence.04:37 PM BSTGeneral Motors shares fall amid battery strugglesGeneral Motors has admitted its battery suppliers are “struggling with delivery issues” as it seeks to revamp its aging electric vehicle range.Shares in the Chevrolet and Buick-maker fell 4pc in trading in New York as chief executive Mary Barra outlined to investors the challenges its electric vehicle line faced.Ms Barra said its battery joint venture in Ohio had slowed down because its “automation equipment supplier is struggling with issues”.

Print circulation was up 2pc, with newsprint costs starting to ease as energy prices fell back. Print revenue fell 3pc, driven by an 18pc fall in advertising.04:08 PM BSTSpotify takes £34m hit on podcastsSpotify has taken a €39m (£34m) mark down on its podcasting division after abandoning a string of deals including its high-profile tie-up with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, James Titcomb reports.The music streaming service said that it had taken the writedown as a result of “write offs and contract termination” on podcasts.In June, Spotify and Archewell Audio, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s podcast production company, agreed to mutually terminate a $20m (£16m) deal they signed in 2020.Meanwhile, Spotify said it had signed up 10m new paying users in the second quarter of the year, hitting 220m subscribers.03:33 PM BSTNearly one in seven standing on trains during peak hoursI’m heading off now and will leave you in the hands of Matthew Field - and this may interest you as you begin your journey home later.About one in seven rail passengers were standing when arriving or departing from cities across England and Wales in autumn last year, new figures show.An average of 173,042 people a day were standing across both morning and afternoon peak times, the equivalent of 13.8pc of passengers, according to data from the Department for Transport (DfT).This is up from around one in 20 in autumn 2021, but still below pre-pandemic levels when the proportion stood at one in six.Railway stations in London accounted for the majority of this total (164,904), where 17.7pc of passengers had to stand - up sharply from 6pc in autumn 2021, but down compared with autumn 2019 (18.8pc).One in seven rail commuters was standing as they as they arrived or departed last autumn - ANDY RAIN/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock03:17 PM BSTGas stored on ships at highest level in two monthsThe amount of liquified natural gas (LNG) stored on ships has jumped to its highest level since May as weak demand in Europe pushes the fuel toward Asian markets.The volume of LNG that has stayed on the water for more than 20 days topped 3.1m metric tons this week — well above the average for the season — according to data compiled by Bloomberg.It comes as European gas storage levels are almost 84pc full, lowering the immediate need for additional supplies amid higher flows from Norway and persistently sluggish industrial demand.However, rising prices raise questions about how long the lack of LNG deliveries can last if demand for fuel picks up later this year in a colder-than-expected winter.Prices have also seen some gains recently amid concerns about escalating Russia-Ukraine tensions and heat waves in parts of Europe disrupting energy networks.Alex Froley, an LNG analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, said: “The loss of Russian pipeline gas remains a huge structural change not yet replaced by the limited new output starting up in 2023.”Dutch front-month futures, Europe’s gas benchmark, have risen 6pc to more than €32 per megawatt-hour. The UK equivalent contract is also rising.03:00 PM BSTWheat prices to rise 15pc after Russia's exit from grain deal, warns IMFThe IMF has warned that the collapse of the Black Sea grain deal will push up prices by up to 15pc in a move that risks keeping global inflation stubbornly high.Our economics editor Szu Ping Chan has the latest:Pierre-Oliver Gourinchas, the IMF’s chief economist, said the deal was “very instrumental in making sure that there was ample grain supply for the world last year”.Russia’s decision to withdraw from the agreement “is likely to put upward pressure on prices”, he added.Brokered last year between the UN, Turkey and Russia, the agreement ensured that Ukraine, one of the world’s breadbaskets, could keep sending its exports via the Bosphorus Strait.Speaking at a press conference, Mr Gourinchas said around 70 million tons of grain had been shipped out of Ukraine under the terms of the deal, helping to reduce global price pressures. Mr Gourinchas added: “Now that this grain deal has been suspended, the same mechanics work in reverse”.While he said the IMF was “still assessing where we’re going to land”, he added that “somewhere in the range of a 10pc to 15pc increase in prices of grains is a reasonable estimate”.He said India’s decision to restrict most rice exports after heavy rains hurt supply will also “exacerbate volatility” on prices and increase the risk of “retaliatory measures” from other countries.02:46 PM BSTAmazon cuts offer for iRobot takeoverAmazon is lowering the price it is paying to acquire iRobot from $61 per share to $51.75 per share, the companies have announced.The Roomba maker has entered into a $200m (£155.9m) financing facility to fund its ongoing operations, which prompted Amazon to change the price to offset the planned increase in iRobot’s net debt, the companies said in a statement.Since Amazon announced the transaction last August, the Federal Trade Commission and European regulators have been probing the deal.IRobot shares fell about 11pc in New York, while Amazon was up 0.5pc.iRobot makes the Roomba robot vacuum cleaner02:39 PM BSTUS markets meagre at openWall Street’s main indexes crept higher at open after a slew of companies forecast upbeat annual profits and quarterly earnings.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was fractionally higher at the open to 35,421.49, while the S&amp;P 500  rose a sliver to 4,555.19.The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.2pc to 14,093.24 at the opening bell.02:30 PM BSTUS house prices rise for fourth straight monthHouse prices in the US climbed for a fourth month as demand combined with low availability to push values higher.A national gauge of prices rose 0.7pc in May from April, according to seasonally adjusted data from S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller.Buyers have been competing for a shortage of listings, generating bidding wars in some areas of the country.In the four weeks to July 16, the total number of homes listed for sale was down 16pc from a year earlier, according to data from Redfin Corp.Craig Lazzara, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, said:Home prices in the US began to fall after June 2022, and May’s data bolster the case that the final month of the decline was January 2023.The breadth and strength of May’s report are consistent with an optimistic view of future months.The housing market cooled over the past year as a surge in borrowing costs kept some buyers on the sidelines. On an annual basis, prices nationally were down 0.5pc, compared with a 0.1pc drop in April.02:20 PM BSTStaying in Russia was 'least bad' options, says Unilever bossThe boss Unilever has insisted that the company chose the “least bad” option by staying in Russia days after the consumer goods giant admitted it would allow its Russian staff to fight in Ukraine if they were called up.The business, which is behind dozens of brands including Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise, was earlier this month named as an “international sponsor of war” by Ukraine’s National Agency on Corruption Prevention.On a call with reporters today, chief executive Hein Schumacher said that Unilever was guided by two main principles in how it runs its Russia business.He said: “We have a continued responsibility vis-a-vis our employees in Russia and... we do not intend to further contribute to the financial capacity of the Russian state.”He said this left the company with three options: To abandon the Russian business, to sell it, or to “pursue our business in a highly constrained manner”.The last option is what Unilever has selected, he said.“With the evolving developments in Russia, we conclude that none of the options are actually good, but that the final option of operating our business in a constrained manner is the least bad.”Last year Unilever paid 3.8bn rubles (£33m) in tax to the Kremlin, largely unchanged compared to the year before.Unilever is behind brands such as Ben &amp; Jerry's and Marmite - TOLGA AKMEN/AFP via Getty Images02:04 PM BSTUK economy to move ahead of Germany, says IMFBritain’s economy will outperform Germany this year as the country escapes recession while a moribund manufacturing sector drags Europe’s biggest economy into one, according to the International Monetary Fund.Our economics editor Szu Ping Chan has the latest:The IMF expects the UK economy to grow 0.4pc this year, confirming predictions published in May as part of its annual economic healthcheck.This represents a big upgrade compared with the 0.3pc contraction it predicted in April, when the UK was forecast to be the worst performing major economy in the world, including Russia.However, the IMF warned that the UK and other advanced economies will find it difficult to tame inflation over the next two years, while the Fund’s chief economist warned living standards may never match growth seen in the past.Germany’s economy is now expected to shrink by 0.3pc this year in a blow to Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who insisted earlier this year that Germany will avoid a contraction.The Fund said the UK’s improvement this year reflected “stronger-than-expected consumption and investment from the confidence effects of falling energy prices”.01:51 PM BSTVodafone on track for full Three takeover, insists chairmanVodafone is on track to take over rival operator Three in a move that would make it the sole owner in UK’s biggest wireless company, its chairman has said.Vodafone agreed last month to merge its UK mobile business with Three UK, owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison.It received the option to buy the entire business after three years if it reaches certain targets.Chairman Jean-Francois van Boxmeer said at the company’s annual general meeting that “the clear path is that Vodafone ultimately will take over the control and full economic ownership of this company in due time”.UK regulators still must sign off on deal, which is subject to competition and national security reviews.The competition investigation is expected to take more than a year, with Government cleared possible by the end of 2023.Vodafone chairman Jean-Francois van Boxmeer - Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg01:38 PM BSTHSBC first high-street bank to cut mortgage rates after inflation fallsHSBC is the first high-street bank to cut mortgage rates after better-than-expected inflation figures last week.Our personal finance reporter Alexa Phillips has the details:The bank said rates across 16 mortgage deals would fall from Wednesday, while smaller lenders also announced reductions.The Telegraph understands HSBC will cut its standard two-year fixed mortgage rate from 6.24pc to 6.14pc for those remortgaging – a drop of 0.1 percentage points.Its five-year fixed mortgage rate for those remortgaging is expected to fall by 0.2 percentage points, from 5.84pc to 5.64pc.It comes after official figures last week showed inflation eased to a 16-month low of 7.9pc in the year to June. This was down from 8.7pc in May and well below the 8.2pc expected by economists.Average mortgage rates dipped slightly for the first time since May the day after the figures were released.Read how smaller lenders are also now cutting costs for borrowers.01:28 PM BSTBritain tops G7 debt interest table for first time on recordThe UK is on track to rack up the highest debt interest payments in the developed world this year as soaring prices send the cost of its inflation-linked debt skyward.The Treasury will spend £110bn on debt interest in 2023, according to a forecast by the ratings agency Fitch, which would be equivalent to 10.4pc of total government revenue.The percentage is the highest of any high-income country, placing Britain at the top of the table for the first time since records began in 1995.About a quarter of UK government debt is made up of so-called index-linked bonds, the payments for which fluctuate in line with inflation.Britain is an outlier in this sense. Italy has the next highest share with 12pc and most countries have less than 10pc.Ed Parker, global head of research for sovereigns and supranationals at Fitch, said: “We’ve had a very large inflation shock which is adversely affecting the public finances and that is obviously a key driver of the sovereign credit rating.”01:10 PM BSTWatchdog to 'make enquiries' about Worldcoin projectThe data regulator has said it will examine Worldcoin, a project by OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman where users provide their iris scans in exchange for a digital identification and free cryptocurrency.A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We note the launch of WorldCoin in the UK and will be making further enquiries.”Worldcoin launched on Monday with two million users from its trial, with the crypto project scaling up eyeball-scanning operations in 20 countries, including at sites in London.Described on its website as a “new identity and financial network”, the Worldcoin project assigns people who sign up a digital ID which it says would distinguish humans from artificial intelligence online.Its cryptocurrency, called the Worldcoin token, will be allocated to users who sign up in some countries, according to the website.The Worldcoin token initially rose after its launch on Monday, hitting a peak of $3.30, and on Tuesday was at $2.01 according to market tracker CoinGecko.The Worldcoin orb scans people's eyes to generate a “proof of personhood” digital record - Jamie Lorriman12:57 PM BSTDow lags rest of Wall Street ahead of big company earningsThe Dow Jones Industrial Average has been subdued in premarket trading, lagging Wall Street peers, following an 11-day rally by the blue-chip index.It comes as investors await quarterly earnings from megacap technology companies including Google-owner Alphabet and Microsoft, which are due after the closing bell. The megacaps rose 0.5pc and 0.8pc, respectively, in premarket trading.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital, said:The results, so far, have been much better than expected. In fact, corporate guidance is pointing to a rosy outlook for Q3 results.Nonetheless, while we expect the summer rally to continue, investor exuberance is likely to lessen in the near-term, portending a less vigorous rally.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has rallied 34.3pc this year, helped by outsized gains in rate-sensitive megacap growth companies on optimism over artificial intelligence and hopes of an end to the US Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle.With the central bank on track for another 25-basis point interest rate hike this week, policymakers face a choice over how much weight to put on recent economic data.In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, while the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.1pc and Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.3pc higher.12:32 PM BSTBank of England's money printing to cost taxpayers extra £50bnThe Bank of England’s money printing programme will cost taxpayers an estimated £270bn over the next decade as sharp increases in interest rates push up losses.Economics editor Szu Ping Chan has the details:Updated analysis reflecting a recent lurch upwards in borrowing costs shows the Treasury is expected to transfer £80bn alone to cover losses suffered by the Bank’s asset purchase facility (APF) over the next two years.This is up sharply from an estimate of £60bn just three months ago and reflects a series of stubbornly high inflation figures that led traders to ramp up their bets on more rate rises.The cost over the next decade has climbed from an estimate of approximately £220bn made in April.The APF hoovered up UK debt during the financial crisis and the pandemic through the quantitative easing. Policymakers only began unwinding the near £900bn stockpile last year.Under a historic deal struck when QE was first launched in response to the financial crisis, the Government agreed to cover any losses suffered by the Bank on bonds it bought to help support the economy.This is because QE created reserves held by commercial lenders in the form of deposits. The Bank pays interest on those reserves at the current base rate of 5pc.12:06 PM BSTJaguar Land Rover drives Tata Motors sales as supply chains rev upSurging revenues at Jaguar Land Rover helped its parent company Tata Motors report better than expected first-quarter sales.The Indian company’s net income was 32bn rupees (£304m) in the three months to June, compared with a loss of 50bn rupees a year earlier.Jaguar Land Rover’s quarterly revenue leapt by 56pc to £6.9bn, helping it to a pre-tax profit of £435m, compared to a loss of £524m the previous year as it grappled with supply chain issues.The British car marque had already said its quarterly wholesale volumes climbed 30pc from a year earlier to 93,253 units, excluding its China joint venture Chery Jaguar Land Rover.It reflecting “continuing improvement in chip and other supply constraints.” Retail sales in China jumped 40pc, while they were flat in Europe.Chief executive Adrian Mardell said JLR delivered its “highest production levels in nine quarters and our highest first quarter cashflow on record” of more than £400m.It comes after Tata Motors announced plans to build one of Europe’s largest gigafactories in the UK, securing half of Britain’s supply of electric vehicle (EV) batteries for the rest of the decade in a £4bn investment.A Land Rover Discovery11:49 AM BSTBanks failed to send transaction histories to customersHSBC, Nationwide Building Society and TSB collectively let down a total of nearly 170,000 customers by failing to provide payment transaction histories, according to the competition watchdog.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which has written to the two banks and building society, said the failures are “not acceptable”.The providers breached part five of the retail banking order, which requires that payment transaction histories should be provided to customers when they close their account.These act as important evidence of a customer’s creditworthiness if they choose to apply for credit, a loan or mortgage elsewhere.Without such evidence, it might be harder or more expensive to take out credit, a loan or mortgage.TSB failed to send payment transaction histories to 105,607 customers for over a year.Nationwide Building Society failed to send these histories to 51,185 customers for over five years.And HSBC failed to send payment transaction histories to around 12,200 customers for nearly five years.11:29 AM BSTOil holds ground as China announces support to boost economyOil has steadied after climbing to a three-month high as China signalled further measures to bolster economic growth and global crude markets continued to tighten.Brent crude has held above $82 a barrel in London, having gained 4pc in the previous three sessions.Leaders in China, the largest crude importer, have indicated more support for the real estate sector alongside pledges to boost consumption, although they did not mention any major fiscal or monetary loosening.Raad Alkadiri, managing director for energy at consultants Eurasia Group, said: “Tighter fundamentals are driving the uptick, but market concerns over demand remain, with China the persistent focus of attention.”Oil has pushed higher this month after the Opec cartel and its allies reduced supplies to help drain global storage levels.That has offset the drag from the Federal Reserve’s campaign of monetary tightening, which is expected to continue with another rate hike this week.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate briefly climbed above $79 a barrel on Monday but has fallen back below.Both WTI and Brent closed above their 200-day moving averages on Monday for the first time in nearly a year. If sustained, that may help spur additional buying as it suggests a healthier technical backdrop.11:13 AM BSTData company's shares plummet 96pc after accounting scandalMore than £823m was wiped off the value of Wandisco after the data replication company’s shares were readmitted to the London Stock Exchange following an accounting scandal.The firm suspended its shares from trading on the Aim junior market in March after revealing a suspected $15m (£12.6m) fraud.An internal investigation found that $15m of revenues and $115m of bookings the firm had reported were completely invented. Wandisco blamed the “potentially fraudulent irregularities” on “one senior sales employee”.This morning, the value of the company’s shares plummeted by 96pc, days after it revealed it had raised $30m at 50p per share.10:59 AM BSTConsumer confidence hits 18-month high after boost for over-65s' savingsBritish consumers are feeling their most confident in 18 months as they shrug off rising interest rates, falling house prices and rent increases.Four in five people admitted inflation is still impacting their spending intentions, according to the latest PwC Consumer Sentiment Survey.However, the mood sits at minus 13, higher than minus 25 after the Spring Budget and a massive improvement on minus 44 in September last year after Liz Truss became prime minister.Under 25s remain the most positive age group at plus 21, with 55-to-64s the most negative at minus 33. Almost half of over 65s say they have money at the end of the month for luxuries or to save, compared with only a quarter of under 65s.Lisa Hooker, leader of industry for consumer markets at PwC, said:Whilst inflation remains the biggest factor affecting finances, we’re also seeing fewer people cutting back and spending intentions have consistently improved over the past 12 months.Retailers need to capitalise on the desire to trade down in the same store rather than trade out and spend on selective treats.But also on those consumers with money left at the end of the month. It is particularly good news for youth focussed retailers as under 25s remain happy to spend but also those targeting the older demographics.10:44 AM BSTGerman recession to ‘drag on’ in third quarterGermany is still in recession, economists have predicted, as its business outlook worsened to nearly its lowest level since Europe’s biggest economy entered a recession in the winter.The fall in the Ifo Institute’s gauge of expectations was bigger than anticipated and “has even worse picture than that painted by the Composite PMI, published yesterday”, according to Capital Economics.Senior Europe economist Franziska Palmas said:The bigger-than-expected fall in the German Ifo, together with the drop in the PMIs published yesterday, suggest that the German economy continued to shrink at the start of Q3. We expect the recession to drag on throughout 2023.Despite the weakness of the recent activity surveys for Germany and the euro-zone as a whole, a 25bp hike at the ECB meeting on Thursday, to 3.75pc, is a done deal.On the margin tough, it may strengthen the case for policymakers to stress that the future path of rates will be data dependent. We still anticipate a final hike in September to 4pc.10:28 AM BSTPound ends longest losing streak in three yearsThe pound has risen, putting it on course to end its longest losing streak against the dollar since March 2020.Sterling has gained 0.2pc against the greenback to push it back in the direction of $1.29.It has also climbed 0.2pc verses the euro, which is worth a little over 86p, ahead of interest rate decisions by the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank this week.The pound had fallen as inflation data came in weaker than expected last week while a PMI survey on Monday also indicated slower growth in the private sector.10:10 AM BSTWorkers face discipline over ticket office stickers, says RMTRailway workers are being threatened with disciplinary action for wearing stickers as part of a campaign to save ticket offices from closing, the RMT union has claimed.The Rail, Maritime and Transport union warned of industrial action if its members are disciplined for promoting the campaign.The union is encouraging the public to sign petitions and take part in consultations over controversial plans to close about 1,000 ticket offices.Writing to train operator LNER, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said:I have received very disturbing reports from members at your company who are being threatened by managers with disciplinary action and being sent home without pay as a result of them wearing ‘save our ticket offices’ stickers.Threatening staff who are fighting for their very futures and for the services they provide in this way is a quite disgraceful tactic to use and I can advise you that any moves to discipline any RMT member for having a simple statement on a sticker will be met with a full industrial response.If a genuine and meaningful consultation process really is to be followed in this process, then surely this would include allowing the very staff whose future employment is threatened to voice their opinions.RMT general secretary Mick Lynch at a rally earlier this month in protest at planned ticket office closures - Jonathan Brady/PA Wire09:56 AM BSTPolice block Elon Musk’s rebrand of Twitter’s headquartersElon Musk’s attempt to strip the Twitter sign from the company’s San Francisco headquarters has been stopped by police after the billionaire failed to get the proper city permits.Our technology editor James Titcomb has the details:Workers were hired to remove the word Twitter and the company’s blue bird logo from a sign outside the company’s offices after Mr Musk changed the social network’s name to X.A worker removed the @ symbol and the letters t, w, i, t and t from one half of the giant sign on Monday.However, work was stopped after police were called to the scene for “a possible unpermitted street closure”.The shutdown left just the letters “er” and the blue bird logo remaining.Read what happened when police arrived.Only the ‘er’ of Twitter signage remains on the company headquarters after police stopped the work - Justin Sullivan/Getty Images09:42 AM BSTTelegraph reports one-third rise in profits to £39mThe publisher of The Telegraph has reported an increase in profits of almost a third, as prospective bidders prepare for the sale of the company by Lloyds Banking Group.Telegraph Media Group’s pre-tax profits climbed by 32pc in 2022 to £39m, according to a trading update today.The increase was driven by a 4pc increase in turnover to £254m, the second year in a row of growth following years of decline caused by the shift away from print across the newspaper industry.Costs were flat and the improvement was delivered mostly by expansion of The Telegraph’s digital subscriptions business, as well as a contribution from a higher print cover price.Read how subscriber numbers have grown.09:26 AM BSTGerman business outlook subdued after recessionGerman business morale clouded over in July for the third month in a row, according to a closely-watched survey, indicating that the road to recovery could be long for Europe’s largest economy as it battles to emerge from recession.The Ifo institute said its business climate index stood at 87.3 following a revised reading of 88.6 in June.The drop was slightly stronger than forecast, with analysts polled by Reuters having expected a July reading of 88.Germany slipped into a technical recession in early 2023, defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction.

It is one of Ukraine’s biggest river ports for grain.It comes about a week after Moscow ended its involvement in the Black Sea Grain Initiative - a deal that allowed Ukraine to ship its crops across the waters - and subsequently attacked Odesa ports.Michael Magdovitz, a senior commodity analyst at Rabobank Group, said: “This strike on the Danube is a huge deal.”He said wheat is likely to be most affected by any shutoff in export capacity, followed by corn.Vegetable oils may still be transported on truck and train, but it is less cost effective for grains to be exported that way, Mr Magdovitz added.Wheat futures climbed as much as 2.6pc in Chicago to $7.7725 a bushel, the highest since February 21.Futures jumped by the exchange limit the previous day. Corn for December delivery rose as much as 0.7pc.Reni, which has come under attack from Russia, is one of Ukraine’s biggest river ports for grain. It is located on the Danube at the border with Romania.Local traders had been expanding capacity there in response to Russia’s sea blockade.While it’s unclear how far the attacks will impact exports from Reni, the strikes increase operational risks.Ukraine, often described as the bread basket of Europe, is the world’s seventh largest exporter of wheat.

Volume fell 10%, which reflects on the company’s efforts to exit some lower-priced and lower-margin businesses. Soft demand owing to slowdown in casual and full-service restaurant traffic, inventory destocking by some customers across international markets and certain U.S. retail channels also led to the downside.Lamb Weston Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lamb Weston Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseLamb Weston price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Lamb Weston Quote Gross profit came in at $379.4 million, up $125.2 million from the year-ago quarter’s levels. Effective pricing actions aided the company’s gross profits. However, increased costs per pound and reduced sales volumes were hurdles.

To skip our detailed analysis of the global airline industry, you can go directly to 5 Most Luxurious Airlines in the World. Airline Industry Profitability OutlookThe airline industry is once again in full swing following the opening of the hospitality and travel industry. On June 5, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) upgraded its profitability outlook of the airline industry for 2023. The airline industry is witnessing high travel demand post-COVID and that is pushing the profitability outlook for the industry. Before we talk about the profitability forecast of the airline industry, let’s briefly take a look at the airline industry's profit margins. As we pointed out earlier, the airline industry has some of the lowest profit margins. This is one of the main reasons why the airline industry is unable to adjust to economic crises or downward pricing pressure, as experienced throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Between 2020 and 2022, the airline industry potentially lost around $200 billion, even the best airlines in the world had job cuts at a massive scale. Even though the airline industry had severe economic impacts during the pandemic, we are noticing a remarkable recovery in 2023. As per IATA, the total revenue is expected to grow to $803 billion in 2023, up by 9.7% year over year. The airline industry revenue will cross the $800 billion mark for the first time since 2019, which was reported at $838 billion. IATA has upgraded its profitability outlook for the airline industry to a net profit of $9.8 billion in 2023 from $4.7 billion, as per the projection in December 2022. The good thing about the industry outlook is that expense growth is expected to remain consistent with an annual increase of 8.1%. IATA’s Director General, Willie Walsh, regarding the airline industry outlook mentioned:“Airline financial performance in 2023 is beating expectations. Stronger profitability is supported by several positive developments. China lifted COVID-19 restrictions earlier in the year than anticipated. Cargo revenues remain above pre-pandemic levels even though volumes have not. And, on the cost side, there is some relief. Jet fuel prices, although still high, have moderated over the first half of the year.Economic uncertainties have not dampened the desire to travel, even as ticket prices absorbed elevated fuel costs. After deep COVID-19 losses, even a net profit margin of 1.2% is something to celebrate! But with airlines just making $2.25 per passenger on average, repairing damaged balance sheets and providing investors with sustainable returns on their capital will continue to be a challenge for many airlines.”Story continuesThe hospitality and leisure industry is reviving as the world’s urge to travel continues to increase. As per IATA, the estimated number of travelers is expected to be around 4.35 billion in 2023. The traveling demand is expected to drive an average passenger load factor of 80.9% in 2023, reaching closer to 2019’s record performance of 82.6%.Some of the busiest airline regions including North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East, should continue to maintain the rising trend in the market. North America leads the way with an expected net profit of around $11.5 billion in 2023. At the same time, Europe and the Middle East should make a net profit of $5.1 billion and $2 billion, respectively.  Airline Industry's New InitiativesTo keep up with the luxury, airline companies always try to offer top-end services in the form of business and first class flights. However, just like any other industry, airline companies need to find a way to make flights eco-friendly. On June 29, the World Economic Forum shared a report which mentions the pre-pandemic carbon emissions from the aviation industry were around 2.5% of global total emissions. The airline industry expects to achieve net-zero flying by 2050. In that premise, Europe is aiming to modernize air traffic control systems to decrease up to 10% of emissions. At the same time, the U.S. is working on a similar programme called NextGen17. As of April 2023, 25 airlines, mostly from the Americas and Europe, have initiated science-based targets to reduce CO2 emissions, according to an analysis by McKinsey. The airlines from the Americas and Europe reflect more than 30% of global passenger traffic. Many airlines around the world have committed to sustainability goals such as carbon reduction and SAF targets. The stakeholders in the aviation industry are working on defined paths to minimize emissions including the Paris Agreement and the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Some of the most efficient practices to reduce CO2 emissions is to optimize air space usage. However, the airlines need to make policies for these new initiatives based on their cost and production. The current economic state makes it difficult for airline companies to adapt to regional incentives and penalties. For instance, Europe's response to the Inflation Reduction Act could influence SAF-related decarbonization costs for the airlines operating in Europe. The President of United Airlines Venture, owned by United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), Michael Leskinen has been vocal about the decarbonization of aviation. On June 19, during the Paris Air Show, Michael while talking to Bloomberg highlighted that United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) is working on sustainable fuel production and limiting the green premium. Leskinen predicts the airline industry will convert to hydrogen over the next 20-30 years. In the first quarter 2023 earnings call, United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) addressed the macroeconomic challenges and what the company has done to achieve its operational targets. The company’s Q1 2023 comments mention:“We can’t control what happens with the macro economy, but we can and are doing a great job of controlling our cost. We can’t run your airline like it’s 2019, it’s different and harder now. Cancellation rates are the leading indicator of forward capacity and therefore CASM-ex and United is leading the way on this front. Gerry will discuss some of the year-over-year tailwinds that will drive lower CASM-ex in the back half of this year, but we only need CASM-ex to be approximately 1 point better in the second half of the year to hit our full year target. We remain solidly on track. To wrap up, over the last 3 years, our industry has confronted a rapidly changing environment. United hasn’t been perfect, but we have got a lot more right than normal.In the big picture, we have got it right and took the steps in the last 3 years to thrive in exactly this environment. International is stronger, the operating environment is more challenging, which means reliability is harder, but also had a premium for producing bottom line results and we had confidence that our gauge growth and execution are keeping United uniquely on track for our near and long-term CASM-ex trajectory, that not to say that there aren’t real near-term risk, because we all know there are, but we feel really good about the strategic setup and tactical execution here at United. I want to again thank the entire United team for their hard work this quarter.We continue to see the benefits of running a strong operation. In the first quarter, United led the industry with the lowest seat cancellation rate despite around 20% of our flights being impacted by weather, the most out of any of our competitors. This was the first time since 2012 that we led on this metric. Additionally, United was first or second in the quarter for on-time departures at nearly all of our hub locations, including those heavily impacted by winter weather like O'Hare and Denver. Our airline is built to run well and recover fast and we expect our operation to reflect that in the peak summer season. We continue to navigate the challenges in the current operating environment. Specifically, constrained industry infrastructure, United is working with the U.S. Department of Transportation and FAA regarding operational disruptions and air traffic staffing challenges.”Some of the best airline stocks to buy according to the hedge funds include United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DLA). 15 Most Luxurious Airlines in the WorldOur MethodologyFor this article, we took the data from two of the most credible sources that give ratings to airlines, Skytrax and Airline Ratings. We took the latest list of the best airlines for 2023 and shortlisted the top 15 airlines from both sources. To measure the luxury, we checked the available first class flights from various airports. The first class category is the top-end flight service offered by an airline. The flights were one-way and the prices of each flight were changed to U.S. dollars, as of July 19. The first class flight with the highest price was ranked higher, and so on. Since this is a highly subjective topic, it was not easy to choose flights from any specific airport, as the availability of first class flights and the routes varied. Our methodology to capture the 15 most luxurious airlines in the world isn’t perfect but a reasonable approximation. For certain flights, the distance varied from the airport. For instance, an airline from the Middle East might charge higher for a flight to Australia rather than Europe, depending on its flight routes. This means our methodology can be biased against airlines operating in different regions. The 15 most luxurious airlines in the world are listed in ascending order of the aforementioned metric. Considering luxury, airlines offer various amenities for their first class flights such as early check-ins, private lounges at the airport, and private rooms on flights. In addition, upscale food is served which can include champagne and other fancy delights. 15 Most Luxurious Airlines in the World15.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of why passengers opt for certain airlines and know which airlines came at the top, you can take a look at the 5 most popular airlines in the world. Although passengers place significant importance on the price of tickets when deciding which airline to choose, the NATS Aviation Index 2019 shows that the importance of on-board facilities is increasingly growing. Besides this factor, the reputation of the airline is also essential, as 71% of the people said they would never fly with an airline that has a bad reputation. Based on IATA’s 2022 Global Passenger Survey, convenience was the top priority of passengers traveling in post-COVID times. Most of the passengers included in the survey wanted their planning and booking information in one single place. It’s one of the reasons why airline CIOs are prioritizing increased spending on digitalization and sustainability by 2024 — according to SITA’s 2021 Air Transport IT Insights. Airline companies are also looking to invest in technology that reduces flight times. In 2022, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) agreed to buy supersonic planes from Boom. These planes will travel as fast as Mach 1.7, which will significantly reduce flight time. For instance, a 10-hour flight will only take 6 hours on these planes. Previously, United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) also committed to buying 15 supersonic planes. We also found that these airline companies are among the 12 best airline stocks to buy — along with Ryanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ:RYAAY), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK), JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU) and Spirit Airlines, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAVE). During the pandemic, many countries imposed strict travel restrictions to curb the spread of infections. It caused a significant decline in passengers opting for air travel. Even when the restrictions were lifted, the passengers must carry vaccination certificates. Story continuesA significant number of airline staff was also laid off at that time. Bloomberg reported that about 400,000 airline industry workers lost their jobs during the coronavirus. To help U.S. airlines survive, the government provided a $54 billion lifeline. The airlines that got the bailout included Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV), American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) and others. As a lot of people have started choosing air travel again, airline companies might find it challenging to cater to the demand. If you want your travel plans to not be affected, it's important to reach the airport early and consider flying from a smaller airport. In the case of international travel, you should check the health insurance requirements of the country you’re traveling to and arrange it beforehand. 20 Most Popular Airlines in the WorldMethodology For our list of the most popular airlines worldwide, we analyzed Cirium’s Airline Passenger Rankings for 2021.

278,49110fe1-2496-3dc0-b75c-2bd6dcd2e294,UAL,2023-07-26,United (UAL) Shows Fast-paced Momentum But Is Still a Bargain Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-ual-shows-fast-paced-125007684.html,1690289407,STORY,['UAL'],"[Momentum investing is essentially the opposite of the tried-and-tested Wall Street adage -- ""buy low and sell high."" Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.United Airlines (UAL) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 5.1% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this airline well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. UAL meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 26.2% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for UAL is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.44. This indicates that the stock moves 44% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that UAL has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped UAL earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, UAL is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. UAL is currently trading at 0.36 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 36 cents for each dollar of sales.So, UAL appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to UAL, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

This compares to earnings of $0.81 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.02%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this parent company of Florida Power &amp; Light Co. Would post earnings of $0.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.84, delivering a surprise of 12%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.NextEra , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $7.35 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.01%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.18 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.NextEra shares have lost about 9.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 18.6%.What's Next for NextEra?While NextEra has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for NextEra: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.87 on $7.42 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.11 on $27.12 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.40 per share, indicating a change of +17.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.50 points to a change of +17.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.39 indicates a change of +16.1% from what Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $1.77 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.5%. The $7.13 billion and $8.14 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14.6% and +14.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIntuitive Surgical, Inc. reported revenues of $1.76 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.4%. EPS of $1.42 for the same period compares with $1.14 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.35%. The EPS surprise was +7.58%.Over the last four quarters, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuitive Surgical, Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The charitable investment will be distributed over five years and solidifies CSX as the leading private funding partner of this transformational project.“We are proud to partner with the University of Florida and the City of Jacksonville on this ambitious project to establish a world-class graduate center in the city’s urban core,” said Joe Hinrichs, CSX president and chief executive officer. “Investing in education is an investment in the future, and we believe this contribution will have a lasting impact on the region by fostering innovation, economic development, and creating bold new opportunities. This project will yield countless benefits for our community, including an influx of top-talent, which will help shape the future of Northeast Florida for generations to come.""Earlier this year, the University of Florida and local city leaders announced a partnership to explore creating a new graduate center in Jacksonville. This graduate center will create a space in Jacksonville that will shape the state’s future workforce and build a pathway for high-skilled, high-tech employees.“Gator Nation is excited and grateful to be engaged in this work with our extraordinary state, local, and philanthropic partners,” UF President Ben Sasse said. “We’re putting our shoulder to the wheel and pushing hard in the same direction to create a space in Jacksonville that will shape the state’s future workforce and build a pathway to prepare the high-skilled, high-tech employees of tomorrow.

It’s a new day in Jacksonville, and both UF and vital partners like CSX will be a critical part of our important work to make Jacksonville a technology and innovation hub.”This historic $10 million donation showcases CSX's commitment to Jacksonville and is a key component in a public-private partnership that includes support from Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Florida State Legislature, and other Northeast Florida civic, community and industry leaders. The proposed center received $75 million in the state’s 2023-2024 budget signed into law June 15 by Gov. DeSantis. The state’s contribution has been amplified by a $50 million pledge from the City of Jacksonville and $62.5 million in gifts from key industry and philanthropic supporters from across the region. By providing significant financial support to this transformative graduate center, CSX exemplifies its role as a corporate leader and catalyst for progress.The university is moving forward with raising funds for the center’s next phase, which will include project development, potential site selection and programmatic evaluation. Mori Hosseini, chair of the UF Board of Trustees, said the university community is excited about the support of CSX, Gov. DeSantis, the Florida Legislature, and community leaders across the First Coast and looks forward to a rewarding partnership that will address critical statewide workforce demand.“UF is ready for the next phase of this work and to lead the way toward making this shared vision a reality,” Hosseini said. “On behalf of the entire UF community, we are grateful to CSX and all those who are helping us advance this impactful and innovative opportunity in Northeast Florida. Our vision for this center is to leverage UF’s strengths in professional development and graduate education to future-proof Florida’s workforce.

In the previous quarter, RCL delivered an earnings surprise of 67.6%.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Royal Caribbean’s second-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $1.58. In the prior-year quarter, RCL reported a loss per share of $2.08.For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $3,378 million. The projection suggests an increase of 54.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Price and EPS SurpriseRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. price-eps-surprise | Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Quote Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up for the quarter to be reported.Factors at PlayRoyal Caribbean’s second-quarter top line is expected to have increased year over year on the back of improvements in booking activities, strong pricing environment and continued strength from onboard revenue areas. Robust demand, courtesy of its digital initiatives, ship upgrades and enhanced product offerings are likely to have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter passenger ticket revenues and onboard and other revenues is currently pegged at $2,284 million and $1,109 million, respectively, indicating growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figures of $1,418 million and $766 million.Our model estimates second-quarter passenger ticket revenues to rise 41.4% year over year to $2,004.8 million. We expect onboard and other revenues to rise 67.3% year over year to $1,281.3 million.The improvement in load factors (courtesy of a rise in close-in bookings at higher prices) are likely to have paved a path for yield improvements in the second quarter. The company anticipates net yields to rise 9.6-10.1% (on a reported basis) and 10.1-10.6% (constant-currency basis) from 2019 levels. Our model predicts second-quarter net yields at $234.8 million (on a reported basis) and $239 million (constant-currency basis).Elevated costs concerning fuel and food are likely to have hurt margins in the second quarter. Our model predicts total cruise operating costs to rise 5.8% year over year to $1,788.6 million.The company expects net cruise costs (excluding fuel per APCD) for 2023 to increase 8.6% (on a reported basis) and 8.9% (constant currency) in the to-be-reported quarter. Per our model, second-quarter net cruise costs (excluding fuel per APCD) is estimated at $117.4 million (on a reported basis) and $118.3 million (constant-currency basis).Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Royal Caribbean this time around.

293,34d117d3-6394-3c65-9ceb-e291225d5295,RCL,2023-07-26,Camping World (CWH) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/camping-world-cwh-expected-beat-140127063.html,1690293687,STORY,"['CWH', 'RCL']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Camping World (CWH) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis recreational vehicle retailer and services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -62.5%.Revenues are expected to be $1.98 billion, down 8.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Camping World?For Camping World, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.19%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination indicates that Camping World will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Camping World would post earnings of $0.02 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.14, delivering a surprise of +600%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Camping World appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry, Royal Caribbean (RCL) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.58 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +176%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.38 billion, up 54.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Royal Caribbean has been revised 1.8% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.29%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Royal Caribbean will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

296,293a5539-5012-3b2c-a679-ccb0cd32d76f,SBAC,2023-07-26,Key Factors to Impact SBA Communications' (SBAC) Q2 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/key-factors-impact-sba-communications-122700701.html,1690288020,STORY,"['SBAC', 'WPC', 'AMT']","[SBA Communications Corporation SBAC is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 31, after market close. The company’s quarterly results are expected to reflect year-over-year growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.This Boca Raton, FL-based communications tower REIT delivered a surprise of 0.64% in terms of adjusted FFO (AFFO) per share in the last reported quarter. SBAC witnessed a year-over-year improvement in site-leasing revenues amid elevated tower space demand, which aided the top line. It continued to benefit from the addition of sites to its portfolio.Over the preceding four quarters, SBAC’s AFFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed it once, the average beat being 1.25%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:SBA Communications Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseSBA Communications Corporation price-eps-surprise | SBA Communications Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayDuring the second quarter, SBA Communications is likely to have benefited from the secular growth trends of the wireless industry. With the advancement in mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G networks, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications, mobile data usage has increased significantly globally. Also, the rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing and cloud services, and hybrid-working scenarios have fueled the rise.This has led to greater capital spending by wireless carriers on the back of incremental demand from global 4G and 5G deployment efforts, growing wireless penetration and spectrum auctions, aiding demand for SBAC’s wireless communication infrastructure. This upbeat trend is likely to have driven healthy tower leasing activity during the quarter, boosting the company’s quarterly earnings.Moreover, SBAC’s long-term (typically 5-10 year) tower leases with wireless service providers that have built-in rent escalators are likely to have supported stable site-leasing revenues for the company in the quarter, boosting its top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter site-leasing revenues, which account for the lion’s share of total revenues, is pegged at $628.1 million, indicating an increase of 8.3% from the year-ago quarter’s $580.2 million. Our estimate for quarterly site-leasing revenues is pegged at $618.3 million, suggesting year-over-year growth of 6.6%.Site-development revenues are, however, expected to be on the lower side in the second quarter. The consensus mark for the same stands at $57.6 million, implying a 19.8% decline from $71.8 million reported in the year-ago period. We expect this quarter’s site-development revenues to slide 23.7% year over year to $54.7 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly total revenues is pegged at $675.8 million, implying year-over-year growth of 3.7%.SBAC’s solid balance sheet position is expected to have supported its investments in the existing 4G networks and its efforts for 5G deployment. Also, asset-base expansion through acquisitions and development activities is likely to have given it an edge.The company’s activities during the to-be-reported quarter were adequate to garner analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly FFO per share has been revised marginally upward to $3.14 over the past week. Moreover, the figure implies year-over-year growth of 2.3%.Nonetheless, high interest expenses and elevated churn in certain markets where the company operates might have been a deterrent for SBAC’s quarterly performance to some extent. We estimate the company’s interest expense to have risen 15% year over year.Story continuesEarning WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for SBA Communications this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — increases the odds of a beat. However, that’s not the case here.Earnings ESP: SBAC has an Earnings ESP of -0.32 %.

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.Jennifer ComoThanks, Jordan. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's Fiscal Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining us today are Ryan McInerney, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Suh, Visa's Chief Financial Officer Designate. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.Story continuesRyan M. McInerneyGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Our financial performance in the third quarter of 2023 was strong, with net revenues up 12% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.16, up 9%. Overall, our global quarterly payments volume was up 9% year-over-year. In the U.S., quarterly payments volume was up 6%, as expected, primarily due to moderating inflation. Outside the U.S., international payments volume was up 12%. Excluding intra-Europe, total cross-border volume remained strong, up 22%, with cross-border travel volume at 136% of 2019. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. As I mentioned on our previous earnings call, my priorities are focused on doing everything that we can to accelerate our growth by executing our strategy, including supporting our go-to-market teams, delivering for our clients, shipping innovative products even faster and selling our solutions even more effectively. With those priorities in mind, I would like to review our progress across our 3 growth levers: consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. We continue to make great strides growing and expanding our consumer payments business, winning with new and existing clients and shifting volume to Visa from a wide array of local, regional and global competitors around the world. Our clients tell us they're choosing to deepen and expand their partnerships with us for a number of reasons, including our people, our products, our value-added services, our new flows and our brand. I'll share a few examples. First, our people. We consistently hear from our clients that they deeply value the advice, local support and partnership they receive day in and day out from our outstanding team members around the world. They also appreciate our thoughtful industry leadership on important and complicated issues across the ecosystem. In fact, in our latest global Net Promoter Score survey, our clients rated us at 73. In the U.S., we retained our position of serving 8 of the top 10 credit unions by recently renewing one of the largest players in the space, Pentagon Federal Credit Union. While there are many reasons for our success with PenFed, our people and our local market relationship model made the difference, just like it has for over 350 U.S. community bank and credit union renewals this year to date. Payments is a local business, and our priority to invest locally with great talent has paid off. For example, across Eastern Europe, Intesa Sanpaolo will issue Visa debit in Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia representing over 3 million Visa credentials. Second, our payment products and innovations consistently help us win. Our clients tell us they choose Visa because our innovative products help ensure they are delivering leading-edge payment solutions to their customers. For example, in Korea, we recently renewed our partnership with Hyundai Card. As part of our new partnership, Hyundai will be taking advantage of our digital payment solutions like data and analytics services to launch a series of new innovations. Hyundai will grow their share of Visa cards in credit and debit for consumer and business. Our innovation also comes from targeted value propositions in traditional products, and we are very pleased to have signed a new long-term partnership with the NatWest Group for consumer debit and credit. Third, our value-added services are helping us win in consumer payments. Our value-added services, such as consulting and analytics, AI-driven data solutions, risk solutions and processing, are a critical differentiator that helps our clients innovate and grow, often without having to use their most scarce resources: technology and engineering. For example, Rakuten Card, a subsidiary of Rakuten Group, which operates the largest e-commerce marketplace in Japan, has signed a new credit deal with Visa to further their strategy to become a top global player. As part of our partnership, Rakuten Card will utilize Visa's processing capabilities and dedicated Visa consulting, data science and analytics teams to support them on strategic initiatives. Fourth, our new flows capabilities. Increasingly, our new flows capabilities such as Visa Direct are an important differentiator to our clients when they're making consumer payments decisions. A great example is Cash App. With 53 million monthly transacting actives, Cash App has renewed and expanded agreement globally, encompassing card issuance, Visa Direct and value-added services.And last, but certainly not least, our brand. In many cases, our clients ask their customers, ""Which brand do you prefer? Would you spend more if we issued this brand or that brand?"" And our clients consistently tell us that consumers overwhelmingly prefer Visa. We see this particularly play out with co-brands. For example, for many of the largest airline co-brands in the world, we remain a partner of choice, and we recently renewed with Korean Air and signed a new agreement with Breeze Airways. We also won a co-brand portfolio with Allegiant Travel Company, the parent company of Allegiant Air. In addition, in Latin America, we expanded our relationship with LifeMiles, Avianca's frequent flyer program from our existing portfolios in 9 countries with 18 issuing banks to an additional 4 countries in the Caribbean region. And finally, we signed a co-brand agreement with Indian conglomerate, Adani, serving 400 million customers through retail, airports and online travel services, among others. Let me now turn to new flows, again, with a focus on how effectively we are delivering on our priorities. Total new flows revenue was up 20% in constant dollars. Commercial volumes increased 9% in constant dollars to total $405 billion. In terms of how we go to market, we are focused on adding commercial products to our existing consumer relationships. KBank, a leading bank in Thailand, has renewed its relationship across debit and co-brand as well as signing a new deal to launch a new business debit card to serve SMEs and micro businesses. PagSeguro, a key Brazilian fintech client, already leveraging our consumer credit and prepaid and commercial prepaid products will expand in the commercial space with the launch of Visa Business Credit for their base of 28 million clients. As we do in the consumer space, we are also constantly working with commercial clients as a strategic partner to develop and deploy unique and innovative solutions. A recent example is with SAP, the global market leader in enterprise application software, which has signed a deal with us across multiple countries in Asia Pacific. We will integrate Visa's virtual card and business solution payment provider capabilities into SAP's business technology platform. SAP serves more than 46,000 customers across Asia Pacific. This deal will create an embedded finance solution for their customers to make B2B payments, helping to improve their working capital positions and enhance their supply chains. For Visa Direct, third quarter transactions grew 20% and were $1.8 billion. In Latin America, we had a bank client transition its onus domestic P2P transactions to an internal ledger system. And while it could be impactful to our transactions over the next several quarters, the impact to revenue is expected to be minimal. At the same time, for their other transactions, this client will continue to utilize our interoperability capabilities provided by YellowPepper. I'm very excited about Visa Direct, particularly as we enter new markets and increase our cross-border presence. Recently, we have expanded or entered several key markets, including in France, with Lydia, the leading P2P provider with over 7 million users. We renewed our issuance relationship, and we have signed a Visa Direct deal to enable their users to top up their wallets using an eligible card. In Bolivia, with fintech libélula's new app called Lula, Visa Direct will be enabling domestic P2P transactions within the app, and YellowPepper will be providing alias directory services. In Mexico, with fintech [Alchemy Pay], Visa Direct will enable B2B cross-border supplier payments for thousands of SME clients in industries, including textiles, software, hardware and electronics across multiple corridors. And we've also continued to expand corridors with important cross-border partners. For example, Revolut, with over 30 million users, has expanded its remittance service with Visa Direct to 89 markets after just launching in July of 2022. Similarly, TransferGo, a cross-border provider in the U.K., serving 6 million customers, have expanded its Visa Direct-enabled corridors from 32 in 2020 to over 160. New flows continue to be an important part of Visa's growth story and our teams are effectively selling and activating our solutions. Now I will touch on value-added services. Our go-to-market approach remains focused on 3 growth areas: deepening client penetration of existing products, expanding geographically and building and launching new solutions. Unlike our core business, our growth in value-added services is often driven by selling a larger number of smaller solutions. This quarter, we succeeded in selling more than 300 new issuing services, 600 new acceptance services and almost 500 new risk and identity services, in some cases, even within the same client. Our sales teams continue to work day in and day out with our clients to understand and resolve their pain points and realize new growth opportunities. Altogether, in the third quarter, we generated $1.8 billion in value-added services revenue, up 19% in constant dollars. A couple of examples of new value-added services to highlight this quarter. First, our partnership with Pay.UK, the account-to-account payments operator in the U.K. was recently announced. We will be piloting our new fraud capability, RTP Prevent, which is uniquely built for instant payments with deep learning AI models. Using RTP Prevent, we can provide a risk score in real time so banks can decide whether to approve or reject the transaction on an RTP network. This is a great example of building and deploying entirely new solutions and our network of network strategy. Second, our recent announcement of our definitive agreement to acquire cloud native issuer processing and core banking platform, Pismo. We believe that Pismo will allow us to strategically serve our clients through additional capabilities, with core banking ledger and issuer processing through cloud-native APIs; additional geographies with operations in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe; and additional products with credit, debit, prepaid and commercial cards, as well as connections to local networks, including PICs in Brazil. From a network perspective, issuer processing and core banking have become important elements to support issuers, activate card credentials and distribute value-added services. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory reviews and approvals and is expected to close by the end of 2023. To wrap up, over the last few months, I have traveled across the globe meeting with clients, partners and regulators, and I continue to see enormous opportunity and momentum. Our brand capabilities, innovation and partnership approach continue to position us well for Visa's future growth, but the most important aspect is our people. And with that in mind, I would like to welcome the newest member of our executive team, Chris Suh, who will become Visa's Chief Financial Officer on August 1. Chris brings to Visa more than 25 years of finance leadership experience from global high-growth companies. His deep experience in finance and technology, plus his leadership in growing and scaling businesses, will be extraordinarily valuable to us as we continue to drive growth and better serve our clients and customers around the world. Plus, as I'm sure you will soon learn, Chris is a real hands-on business builder with a passion for technology and an intense focus on people who will fit in well with the culture of Visa. I've asked Chris to join the Q&amp;A portion of our call today, but please remember he isn't our CFO for a few more days. Before the Q&amp;A, let me hand it over to Vasant to provide financial highlights for the quarter and our thoughts on the rest of the year. But first, Vasant, I know I speak on behalf of all of Visa and our investors that we are deeply grateful to you for your outstanding strategic and financial leadership. I have worked shoulder to shoulder with Vasant for the past 8 years, and I continue to be in awe of him. He is a world-class CFO, And if there is a CFO Hall of Fame, I am confident he will be a first ballot inductee. Vasant, we wish you all the best. So for likely the last time on an earnings call in your career, over to you, Vasant.Vasant M. PrabhuThank you, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal third quarter net revenues were up 12%. And GAAP EPS, up 25%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 9%. In constant dollars, net revenues grew 13%, and non-GAAP EPS grew 11%. We have now lapped the impact of Russia. A few key highlights. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 9%. Index to 2019, global payments volume was up 48%. U.S. payments volume was up 6% year-over-year, consistent with expectations and stable since March. Transactions growth has remained steady at pre-COVID levels of 8%. Average ticket size is down 2%, largely due to declining fuel prices and the general moderation of inflation across multiple categories. Relative to 2019, U.S. payments volume was up 54%. International payments volume growth was up 12%. The uptick in international payments volume since the last quarter is the result of lapping the discontinuation of Russian operations. Relative to 2019, international payments volume was up 43%. The cross-border travel recovery continues at the pace we expected with volume ex intra-Europe indexing at 1.36 versus 4 years ago, a 6-point improvement from the second quarter. Summer travel across most regions picked up, with travel in and out of Asia seeing strong gains, along with travel inbound to CEMEA and outbound from Europe. Travel into the U.S. is still hovering at 2019 levels. Our new flows and value-added services businesses continued to grow at almost 20% in constant dollars. In the third quarter, we bought back approximately $3 billion in stock at an average cost of $229.19 and distributed $937 million in dividends. We also added $500 million to the litigation escrow account, which has the same effect as a stock buyback. Now on to the details. In the U.S., credit grew 5% year-over-year. Debit grew 6%, generally in line with March growth rates post the uptick in January and February due to lapping of Omicron in 2022. U.S. card present spend grew 3%. Adjusted for fuel, which saw a significant price increase last year, U.S. card presence spend was up 5%. U.S. card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 8%. U.S. processed transactions growth was stable at 8%. The step-down in U.S. payments volume growth since March was driven by a 2% decline in average ticket size. When we look at spend by category, ticket sizes are declining most significantly in fuel and, to a lesser extent, in retail goods, travel and food and drug. As you know, fuel prices spiked last year due to the Ukraine war. Travel prices spiked as the world reopened post Omicron. Goods prices spiked due to supply chain bottlenecks and commodity inflation. Excluding these 4 categories, average ticket size growth is positive. Consumer spend across all spend bands from affluent to low spend remained stable since March. Our data did not indicate any behavior change across consumer segments. Putting all this together, we continue to believe that the primary driver of the step-down in U.S. payments volume growth since March is moderating inflation and that the consumer has remained resilient so far. Moving on to international markets. In constant dollars, international payments volume growth rates were strong through the quarter in the major markets. Latin America was up 20%. Our CEMEA region grew 28%. We're now lapping the impact of Russia. Europe was up 10%. Excluding the U.K., Europe volumes grew 23%. Asia Pacific, excluding China, grew 12%. Global process transactions were up 10%. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, were up 22% year-over-year, up 49% versus 4 years ago. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 9% year-over-year and 74% above 2019. Adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases, cross-border e-commerce spending grew year-over-year in the low double digits, in line with pre-COVID growth rates. Cross-border travel-related spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 34% year-over-year. The cross-border travel, excluding intra-Europe index to 4 years ago, went from 134 in March to 139 in June. Travel into Asia continue to improve, indexing at 118 for the quarter, up more than 10 points from Q2, while travel out of Asia was up almost 10 points to 107. Looking at Mainland China specifically, cross-border travel continued to improve but remains well below 2019 levels. Travel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continue to be strong in the mid-150s index to 2019. The inbound travel recovery remains sluggish, still just under 2019 levels. While some of the mitigating factors eased this quarter, the dollar remained quite strong relative to pre-COVID levels. In Europe, excluding intra-Europe, inbound and outbound travel remains robust with the index for 2019 in the low 140s for outbound, improving 10 points from the second quarter, and in the low 150s for inbound. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean also remained very strong, indexing in the low 160s to 2019 levels. Travel out of CEMEA indexed in the 140s versus 4 years ago, and inbound improved more than 10 points to the low 160s. Moving now to a quick review of third quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 15% versus the 10% growth in second quarter constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag was more than offset by business mix and pricing. As a reminder, third quarter service fees reflect second quarter payments volume growth, which was helped by lapping Omicron in fiscal year '22. Data processing revenues grew 15% versus 10% processed transactions growth. They have fully lapped the Russia impact, and the key drivers of performance were value-added services and pricing. International transaction revenues were up 14% versus a 22% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth lagged volume growth primarily due to declining currency volatility and exchange rate shifts. Other revenues grew 15% led by pricing, consulting services and card benefits. Client incentives were 28.1% of gross revenues, in line with our expectations. Revenue growth was robust across our 3 growth engines. Consumer payments growth was driven by stability in domestic volume growth and transactions as well as growth in cross-border volumes. New flows revenue grew 20% in constant dollars. Commercial volumes were up 9% in constant dollars and 58% over 4 years ago. Visa Direct transactions grew 20%, and as Ryan mentioned, were impacted by a bank client that transitioned its domestic P2P transactions to an internal ledger system. While it could be impactful to transactions over the next several quarters, the impact to revenue is expected to be minimal. Value-added services revenue grew 19% in constant dollars driven by higher volume, strong advisory services and select pricing actions. GAAP operating expenses decreased 1%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 10%, driven primarily by personnel expenses from headcount additions over the past year. Excluding gains from our equity investments of $85 million, non-GAAP nonoperating income was $37 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates. Our GAAP tax rate was 19.2%, and non-GAAP was 19.4%. GAAP EPS was $2. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.16, up 9% over last year, inclusive of a nearly 1.5 point drag from the strong dollar. We have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Pismo for $1 billion in cash, subject to customary closing conditions. We will keep you posted on closing timing and financial impact. In May, we upsized our revolving credit facility to $7 billion and renewed it for 5 years. Through the first 3 weeks of July, U.S. payments volume was up 6%, with debit up 6% and credit up 6%. Compared to 4 years ago, they are up 56%, 65% and 47%, respectively. REG II has not measurably impacted volumes so far. In several key markets around the world, growth was in line with the third quarter. Process transactions grew 10% year-over-year and up 54% about 4 years ago. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 20% and was 51% about 4 years ago. Card-not-present non-travel growth was 72% about 4 years ago. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 41% over 4 years ago. Moving now to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Growth in domestic payments volumes remained stable around the globe. As such, we're assuming recent trends will sustain in the U.S. and key international markets for the rest of the quarter. On the cross-border front, the travel recovery trend has been steady and generally in line with our expectations so far for fiscal year '23. The cross-border travel index to 2019, excluding intra-Europe, has been improving at a rate of 5 to 6 points each quarter. We are assuming this pace of recovery continues into the fourth quarter. The region to monitor closely is Asia, especially travel in and out of Mainland China. On the cross-border e-commerce front, we're also assuming recent trends continue adjusted for crypto-related volatility. It is important to note that just as we saw in the third quarter, even as the cross-border business continues to recover relative to 2019, the year-over-year growth rate will continue to slow down. Also, currency volatility is moderating, and we are now lapping very high currency volatility from the fourth quarter last year. Our value-added services and new flows businesses have grown much faster than our consumer payments business. Sustaining faster growth rates for these businesses remains a critical priority. In the fourth quarter, we expect incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be between 27.5% to 28.5% to finish the year at the high end of the 26.5% to 27.5% range. When you pull all this together, we expect fourth quarter net revenue growth of around 10% in nominal dollars with minimal impact from exchange rate shifts. The sequential slowdown is driven by 3 factors: the quarter lag in recognizing service fees, the expected slowdown in cross-border growth and moderating currency volatility lapping very high levels reached last year. As we indicated previously, non-GAAP operating expense growth in Q4 will likely be another 2 to 3 points lower than Q3. Non-GAAP results exclude certain acquisition-related items from the fourth quarter last year. Nonoperating income will continue to benefit from the attractive rates we're earning on our cash balances. Interest income from cash will more than offset interest expense from debt by around $30 million in the fourth quarter. Our tax rate is expected to remain in the 19% to 19.5% range in Q4. Assuming the performance expected in the fourth quarter, we will deliver low double-digit net revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth in fiscal year '23 despite concerns about a slowdown and an exchange rate drag. This once again demonstrates the resilience of our business, the large opportunity that remains available to digitize cash globally and the opportunity to accelerate our growth by developing vast new use cases while layering on additional value-added services. To finish, this will be my last earnings call as CFO of Visa. I want to thank all of you for your trust and support. At all times, you kept us on our toes with our nose to the grindstone. Hopefully, we've delivered for you. This is also my last call as a public company CFO. I started this journey in September 2000, almost exactly 23 years ago. To use a cricketing term some of you will understand, I did not hit a century of earnings calls. I fell as I entered the '90s. On October 1, I will be switching over to your side as a shareholder of Visa, cheering from the stands as Ryan, Chris and the team lead Visa to another double and triple. Thank you, Ryan. We've had a great run together. It's over to you, Chris. I'm going to miss my finance team and the wonderful people of Visa. And as far as the CFO Hall of Fame goes, I'm sure no CFO would invest in that business proposition. And now, Jennifer, it's time for some Q&amp;A.Jennifer ComoThanks, Vasant. And with that, we're ready to take questions, Jordan.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein.Harshita RawatI want to ask about the Block lawsuit. They have been close partner of yours and all the issuers of Cash App, Visa cards on which they ought to benefit from interchange. And Ryan, you talked about the current partnership there. Any comments you have on the lawsuit will be helpful. And also just broadly, how should we think about the relationships with fintech and [Cash App].Ryan M. McInerneyYes. Thanks for the question. We have a wonderful relationship with Block, a deep partnership across many different elements, as I mentioned. As it relates to the lawsuit, there was some confusion in the market by the lawsuit. There's really nothing new here. The lawsuit is included in the MDL 1720. And thus, the lawsuit itself is covered litigation under our share class structure. So I would really put it in the category of nothing new here. And all the way back to the beginning of your question, we deeply value our relationship with Block and feel great about the deep and extended partnership we have with them.OperatorOur next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.Daniel Rock PerlinI wanted to just touch base real quickly on value-added services from the standpoint of penetration for a second. I think it's around 20% or so of the company's net revenues. It's clearly yield enhancing. So it seems like a pretty large business. But Ryan, every time you talk about it, it sounds like there's so much room for growth, and it's hard for us to kind of pinpoint where you are in terms of penetration within your existing business. So any way you could frame that either anecdotally or quantitatively would be great.Ryan M. McInerneyYes. Thanks for the question. I mean the truth is we are at the beginning of the journey across all of our value-added services businesses. They all have enormous TAM. We all have -- they have enormous runway in terms of the opportunity to continue to penetrate. Our Acceptance Solutions business, whether it's CyberSource or Verifi or Visa Acceptance Cloud, I mean enormous amount of runway there. In issuing, we've talked about the opportunity we have now with Pismo when we close on that deal, and the same thing with DPS risk and identity advisory. I mean it really is -- they're all businesses that have enormous TAM. We're in the very early innings of our penetration, and we don't see in any of those businesses anywhere close to running out of runway anytime.OperatorOur next question comes from Craig Maurer with FT Partners.Craig Jared MaurerSorry, wasn't quick enough on the unmute button. So I wanted to ask about the loss of what I think I heard was a Visa Direct client in LatAm and why the transition to an internal system for them. And that leads to my follow-on which is, can you discuss the trends you're seeing globally in terms of domestic payments moving away from or back to domestic networks? Your comments in the beginning of the call seemed to indicate that there might be an acceleration toward the global networks to take advantage of what has clearly been greater investment levels into the capabilities.Ryan M. McInerneyCraig, thanks for the two questions. I'll take the second one first. We are continuing to see the benefits of our investment all around the world. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing issuers, consumers shift share to Visa, shift their preference to Visa. And it happens in different ways in different countries versus the domestic schemes. But it is coming back to what you said, which is our ability to consistently invest in security features and tokenization and new digital use cases, we believe, is what's helping us win in that space. If you go back to the first part of your question, these types of things are going to happen when you're building out a new platform like we are in Visa Direct. It's still the very early days of building out Visa Direct. We're expanding in geographies and use cases. And as different partners use Visa Direct and they start to try it for different use cases, they'll find some of them work great. And other ones, they'll find opportunities to use it differently. In the case of the situation in Latin America that I mentioned, they started the journey of what they were working on using Visa Direct. They found it to be a more efficient way to get going in their journey, and then they found that they built an internal ledger system that they didn't have originally. But as I mentioned, they're going to continue to use our services for a number of things that they do. And listen, I think as we all talk over the coming quarters and years as we build out this platform, there's going to be ebbs and flows. There's going to be use cases that grow faster than others and things that stick and others that don't, and that's what building a new global business that has the reach of our platform is going to have.OperatorOur next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.Sanjay Harkishin SakhraniCongratulations, Vasant. Despite the concerns of choppy economy and disinflation, Vasant, you mentioned when we look at the July trends, and obviously, the trends in general over the course of the year, they've been very encouraging. And you mentioned the different categories. But as we look across the next 12 months, anything to parse out or think about in terms of the comps or how you see things playing out as we get maybe preliminary views on 2024?Vasant M. PrabhuThanks, Sanjay. Yes. I mean the general term we've used all along is stability, and we think things are still very stable. You look at transactions growth, it's been very stable in the U.S., around 8%. If you just adjust for the Omicron uptick we had last quarter, and you go back to pre-COVID trends or first quarter trends, transactions growth has been very stable. Clearly, some of the change in trends we pointed to ticket size. I don't think I want to get into talking about next year. We'll leave that to Ryan and Chris in October, which is when we normally do talk about next year. But more -- in the more near term, the fourth quarter, the biggest hit to ticket size has been fuel, and fuel comparisons are going to moderate. And so that should help us a bit in the fourth quarter, and that's reflected in our expectations. In general, I would say the trends we're seeing across the board are unchanged from where they've been for the past several months.OperatorOur Next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.Jason Alan KupferbergVasant, best of luck to you. I wanted to actually ask about surcharging. I know Visa recently lowered the cap on the credit card surcharging to 3% from 4%. Just wanted to know, is this in response to a trend of more merchants employing surcharges, whether that might be in a compliant or a noncompliant manner? If so, are there any implications for Visa we should be considering from surcharging?Ryan M. McInerneyNo implications you should be considering. It won't surprise you, we don't feel great that consumers get surcharge. But of course, in certain jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, merchants have the ability to do that, and some choose to do it. Many choose to do it, and then they choose to pull back on it because it's not a great customer experience. The small adjustment that we made that you referenced was one. Just making sure that when consumers do get surcharge, it's something that's fair and equitable, and that was the purpose of the change.OperatorOur next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.Bryan Connell KeaneVasant, since it's your last earnings call, I got to ask you about incentives. You got to go out on an incentives question, at least. So as incentives look like they're going to be towards the higher end of the range, just the puts and takes that pushed it towards the high end. Was there more deal activity this fiscal year or different volumes that changed the incentives towards the high end?Vasant M. PrabhuYes. I mean it's -- well, thanks for saying those nice things. I -- in general, on incentives, they were in line with what we expected. So there were no surprises there. And incentives, everybody focuses on the percentage. If you look at what really counts, which is net revenue growth, we had healthy net revenue growth in the quarter. Even with the exchange rate drag, we were almost 12%, and the exchange rate drag would have added another point. If you look at yields, net revenue yields are higher than they were a year ago. We did have some renewals happen earlier than we expected. So we did have some renewals come into this year and Q3 that we might have thought would happen next year, but we're happy about that. We're always happy to renew clients even if we have to do it a little earlier. So all in all, no surprises there.OperatorOur next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.Lisa Ann Dejong EllisWelcome, Chris. And Vasant, you'll be missed. I wanted to follow up on the prepared remarks call-out on the partnership with Pay U.K. around RTP Prevent. Can you elaborate a bit more on that? These are the types of value-added services I know we've all been eagerly waiting to see. So can you talk a little more about sort of what the scope is of the pilot and exactly how that service works and how you'll be monetizing it, if not in the pilot, then over the longer term?Ryan M. McInerneyLisa, yes, thanks. So it is one of the things we've been talking about is how we can build value-added services for new networks, specifically for RTP as it starts to grow and expand around the world. So I guess how it works to the core of your question. So first of all, what we've done is we've built a real-time risk score. We've built it uniquely for instant payments, where there's often unique cases of fraud in terms of how they work. We built it using deep learning AI models. And what it does is it enables banks to be able to decide whether to approve or reject the transaction in real time, which is a capability that most banks or most real-time payments networks around the world have been very hungry for. It's a score from 1 to 99. It comes with an instant real-time code that explains the score. And what it does is it leverages our proprietary data that kind of we have used to enhance our own risk algorithms as well as the data that we see on a lot of our payment platforms, including Visa Direct. And one of the benefits of us bringing that to market is it integrates with the bank's existing fraud and risk tools. Because we're often providing these types of risk scores to banks and they're ingesting them from us, it directly integrates into their fraud and risk tools, so the real-time information, their systems know how to use it. It can be automated into their decisioning algorithms and those types of things. So think about it -- if you want -- if you back way up, if you think about it, it's similar to our Visa Advanced Authorization service that we offer on VisaNet. But we've built from the bottoms up, clean sheet of paper, a customized solution, leveraging deep learning AI models and integrated that directly into the bank system so that they can ingest that in real time. The pilot is just getting going. It's very early days, so we'll report back as we learn more. And hopefully, we'll have more examples like this to talk about around the world.OperatorOur next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.Ashwin Vassant ShirvaikarCongratulations, gentlemen. Also, Chris, welcome. And Vasant, thank you for your help and partnership over the years. I wanted to ask about value-added services. Revenue yield there was quite solid and wanted to ask what's leading to that. Would you call it sort of structural at this point? Or is it more episodic? Like in the past, you had benefits from, say, FX volatility or incentives, things like that. So that's the question.Vasant M. PrabhuYes, FX volatility would not affect value-added services. We don't count our treasury revenues in value-added services. So value-added services are benefiting from structural and secular things. First, it's deepening our penetration of existing clients. So it's a concerted effort to sell more services to existing clients. Second is some of the services were not operating globally. We are now making these services available around the world. So it allows us to clearly increase the scope of the market. And then third, as you know, we've been adding services over time. So this is a long-term growth engine for us. Our goal is to continue to grow it at a very hefty clip. And think about it as, to get a transaction and the more services you can layer on and the more value you can add to the transaction, the more yield you can get on it. So it's very much a growth engine, one of three, and we think it can grow for a very long time.OperatorOur next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research.Kenneth Christopher SuchoskiI just wanted to ask about cross-border. Obviously, Visa is shaking some headwinds on the yield side in this business. Can you just talk about how much more of a headwind you think this is going to be in fiscal 4Q and fiscal 1Q of next year compared to what we saw this past quarter?Vasant M. PrabhuYes. So just to correct, the way to think about value-added services yield, and I know you're looking at the revenue and dividing it by the volume, is there's the yield on the transaction and then there's the yield on the exchange rate translation services we provide. Where the yield has gone down, because it was very high last year, is on the exchange rate translation service, what we call our treasury revenues, because currency volatility last year was 30% to 40% higher than it is right now. Currency volatility right now is a little higher than the long-term average. But last year, it was an extraordinary highs. In fact, in the fourth quarter, we will lap some of the highest levels of currency volatility reached last year. And based on where volatilities are today versus last year, volatilities are down almost 40%. So it's a sizable move. So any yield difference you see in that line is because of treasury revenues. It's not from our core cross-border yields, which remain very steady. It's going to fluctuate based on currency volatility. And really, it's still decent. It's just that it was very high last year.OperatorOur next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.Darrin David PellerVisa right now is net cash for the first time, I think, since 2016, since pre the Visa Europe deal, and gross debt below 1x. I know your target generally is 1 to 1.5x. And the buyback, frankly, was a little bit light also tracking at about 76%. Last year, you paid out about 76% of net income and buybacks. So I think you need to do a pretty big catch-up in this quarter. So just curious to hear how you're thinking about capital allocation. I guess, Ryan, the multiple is lower versus the market's been in a while. Do you see this as a good opportunity for buybacks to pick up pace? Or are there other reasons why you'd want to allocate capital different ways, guys?Vasant M. PrabhuYes, I'll start, and maybe Ryan can add. No, there's no change in capital allocation strategy, which is pay a dividend. The dividend has a certain set of criteria we use between a certain percentage range of our EPS. It gets to a certain yield, and it's almost $1 billion a quarter now. We do buybacks generally out of free cash flow. We have historically not borrowed to do buybacks. And clearly, our first priority is to invest in the core business and to do acquisitions that make sense. And as you can see, we've been doing both. In terms of the volume of buybacks, remember that we did contribute $850 million to the escrow account, which is also equivalent to a buyback. So if you count that in, we are probably around $9 billion or so in buybacks, if I remember right, so far this year. Clearly, we have more capacity if you want to do buybacks. We've always said that if we felt there was a disruption in the market and stock was trading at levels that did not reflect intrinsic value, we would be willing to step up our buybacks and borrow money if that made sense. So obviously, we'll keep you posted if any of our plans change. Ryan, you may want to add some things.Ryan M. McInerneyNothing to add to your very well-said comments, Vasant.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.Andrew William JeffreyVasant, best of luck to you. It's been a pleasure. Ryan, I wanted to ask about the -- some of the commercial efforts that Visa is making. I know it's a pretty important driver of sort of new flows, the nonconsumer part of your business growth. And this quarter, it was a little bit slower than overall volume. Can you just comment on the pipeline and what you see as the opportunities in commercial and how we should think about that business growing over the next few years?Ryan M. McInerneySure. Thanks for the question. We remain very excited about B2B in general. It's an enormous TAM, and we're just kind of scratching the surface, and we're very excited about commercial specifically. We have the largest commercial business on the planet, as we've talked about in the past. I think it's in the neighborhood of $1.5 trillion of payment volume, and we've been releasing numbers of innovations into the market in that space. We've released Visa Spend Clarity, which helps our clients with expense management; Visa Commercial Pay, which helps with control. There's a lot of things we've done around enabling acceptance around the world. So we feel good about it. As it relates to the volume, some of the dynamics that we're seeing in the commercial space are similar to what we're seeing in the consumer space, you have the impact from fuel and those types of things. But as we think over the next 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years, we've never been more excited about the opportunities that we've got. And we've never felt better about the product that we're putting in the market, and we're getting great feedback from our clients as well.OperatorOur next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.Ramsey Clark El-AssalCongratulations to you Vasant. I wanted to ask for a follow-up on Reg II. You mentioned not seeing any impact yet. I'm just wondering from your vantage point, whether you're now seeing that routing choice more broadly available to kind of -- all merchants or are we still in the midst of an implementation and rollout. And then just quickly and separately, your tax rate guidance would imply no impact from the recent Brazil tax [law] changes that did impact Mastercard, but I'm just double checking if that's the case.Ryan M. McInerneyWhy don't I -- I'll take the first part and let Vasant take the second part. It's early days with Reg II. There's been a lot of work that happened ahead of the July 1 date, but there's also work still happening. As it relates to our views on our ability to compete in the space, we're -- we continue to be very excited and confident about our ability to compete. We think that many merchants are going to still choose to route to Visa. As you all know, merchants bear liability for fraud in the e-commerce space. So when they're making decisions, it's not just a cost-based decision. And we bring a lot to merchants in terms of the way we help them with managed risk. We have advanced fraud tools, advanced risk scoring capabilities. And as you know, we also have the product functionality enabled by dual messaging to enable a lot of use cases that are key in the e-commerce space. So we are -- we feel very good about our ability to compete. And there's a lot that's going to happen over the course of the next many months and quarters, and we'll keep you posted on how it evolves.Vasant M. PrabhuYes. On the Brazil topic, you should ask Mastercard what was unique to them, really no change from our standpoint as it relates to Brazil.OperatorOur next question comes from Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse.Timothy Edward ChiodoVasant, thank you for always being a gentlemen for all the help over the years. I want to dig a little bit -- actually, this question is for you, Vasant. On the gap between nominal cross-border volumes ex inter Europe and international revenue on a nominal basis, you talked about the FX volatility part plenty. I was just hoping you could dig into a little bit about the other factors that drive that gap, meaning quarter mix and any pricing and how we should think about those over the coming quarters.Vasant M. PrabhuYes. Yes, it is largely volatility-driven because of the very high volatilities we had last year and more normal volatilities we're getting to now. Beyond that, there's some FX impact, obviously. That line is always affected by FX more than any other line in the P&amp;L. And other than that, there are always mix factors. It depends on corridors and all that. There's always some impact from that. But I would say the bulk of it is the two we talked about, volatility and exchange rates.OperatorOur final question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.Tien-Tsin HuangLast question. So I won't ask you, for Vasant. That's my gift and way to thank you, so I'll spare you a macro question. I'll ask Ryan instead on Pismo if that's okay. Ryan, you mentioned -- I think you mentioned shipping products faster in your upfront remarks. That made me think about Pismo a little bit. Is buying Pismo an indication in any way that Visa is more interested in owning tech and infrastructure that touches products, the consumer and that gives you a chance to develop products faster? Just I'm curious to get your thoughts on that. It feels like you're widening the swim lane a little bit here. Is that fair to say? I would love your thoughts.Ryan M. McInerneyTien-tsin, what we're trying to do is serve our clients. I mean that's where it all starts with. And what our clients are looking for is they're looking for innovative processing solutions. They're increasingly looking for cloud-native API-based services. Processing is certainly one of those. We've heard from clients around the world that many of them are embarking on digital transformations in their processing platforms. And so when we hear that from our clients, we immediately get to work on how we can help them, how we can serve them. We went through a global process looking at all the different players around the world, and we identified Pismo as the best. We literally studied hundreds of companies. We met with dozens of them. And after a deep, thorough scan, we identified Pismo. And yes, Pismo is the kind of tech platform, Tien-tsin, that you were alluding to. That is the type of tech that our clients are increasingly looking for. And in this example, it was an opportunity for us to buy the leading player that could help clients serve their customers, expand globally and deliver a lot of new leading edge use cases to their customers. So we're very excited about it. Thanks for the question.Jennifer ComoAnd with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day, and please join me in wishing Vasant the best.OperatorThank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.]"

Last year's results included a $456 million legal expense. Excluding that one-time cost, Visa's adjusted profits rose 7% from a year earlier.Visa said its payments volume rose 9% from a year earlier, while the number of processed transactions on Visa's network increased 10% from a year earlier. Visa gets a fee from merchants and businesses who use its payment network to process transactions, so Visa's profits rise and fall with the global economy as well as customers choosing to use a Visa debit or credit card over its competition or cash.Roughly $3.799 trillion was processed on Visa's network last quarter, with the biggest growth coming from Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.

CORPORATIONSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATIONRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(Unaudited)(dollars in millions, except per share data)Management utilizes the non-GAAP financial measures defined below as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Company’s financial performance, communicating operating results to the Company’s Board of Directors and assessing related employee compensation measures. Management believes that such non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors in assessing the Company’s overall financial performance, trends and period-over-period comparative results. Non-GAAP financial measures related to net sales exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions. Non-GAAP financial measures related to operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, effective tax rate and diluted EPS exclude income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the periods presented. Items excluded from such non-GAAP financial measures in any period may consist of, without limitation, acquisition-related expenses, refinancing-related costs, gains associated with bargain purchase acquisitions, and certain discrete tax items including but not limited to (i) the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and (ii) the impact of significant changes in tax law. The following non-GAAP financial information is included for supplemental purposes only and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for or superior to the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily the same or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies as such measures may be calculated differently or may exclude different items. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.The following are reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the periods presented:NET SALESPercentage Growth (relative to same prior year period) (1)Net salesForeignConstantOrganicgrowth incurrencyCurrency NetAcquisitionNet SalesU.S. Dollars (2)impact (3)Sales Growth (5)impact (4)Growth (5)Three Months Ended June 30,20232022(GAAP)(non-GAAP)(non-GAAP)(non-GAAP)(non-GAAP)Net sales by segment:Harsh Environment Solutions$888.9$790.412%—%13%4%9%Communications Solutions1,161.61,378.5(16)%(1)%(15)%1%(16)%Interconnect and Sensor Systems1,003.4967.94%(1)%4%3%1%Consolidated$3,053.9$3,136.8(3)%(1)%(2)%2%(4)%Six Months Ended June 30,Net sales by segment:Harsh Environment Solutions$1,743.1$1,518.015%(1)%16%5%11%Communications Solutions2,288.42,698.6(15)%(1)%(14)%—%(14)%Interconnect and Sensor Systems1,996.51,872.07%(2)%9%3%5%Consolidated$6,028.0$6,088.6(1)%(1)%—%2%(2)%Percentages in this table were calculated using actual, unrounded results; therefore, the sum of the components may not add due to rounding.Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. While the term ""net sales growth in U.S. dollars"" is not considered a U.S. GAAP financial measure, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measure based on GAAP results, which serves as the basis for the reconciliation to its comparable non-GAAP financial measures.Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the percentage impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current reporting period(s) compared to the same respective period(s) in the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting net sales for the current reporting period(s) translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior year period(s) from net sales for the current reporting period(s), taken as a percentage of the respective prior year period(s) net sales.Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the percentage impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions that have not been included in the Company’s consolidated results for the full current period(s) and/or prior comparable period(s) presented. Such net sales related to these acquisitions do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Acquisition impact is calculated as a percentage of the respective prior year period(s) net sales.The following are definitions of certain non-GAAP financial measures presented in the table(s) above, which may be referred to within this press release. For purposes of this press release, the terms ""constant currencies"" and ""organically"" have the same meaning as the following non-GAAP financial measures, respectively:Constant Currency Net Sales Growth is defined as the period-over-period percentage change in net sales growth, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company’s results are subject to volatility related to foreign currency translation fluctuations. As such, management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Organic Net Sales Growth (defined below) and Constant Currency Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends.Organic Net Sales Growth is defined as the period-over-period percentage change in net sales growth resulting from operating volume and pricing changes and excludes (i) the foreign currency translation impact, which is outside the control of the Company, and (ii) the acquisition impact, both as described above and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Constant Currency Net Sales Growth (defined above) and Organic Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends.AMPHENOL CORPORATIONSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATIONRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued)(Unaudited)(dollars in millions, except per share data)OPERATING RESULTSThree Months Ended June 30,20232022Net IncomeNet Incomeattributable toEffectiveattributable toEffectiveOperatingOperatingAmphenolTaxDilutedOperatingOperatingAmphenolTaxDilutedIncomeMargin (i)CorporationRate (i)EPSIncomeMargin (i)CorporationRate (i)EPSReported (GAAP)$619.920.3%$460.521.9%$0.74$648.820.7%$472.523.3%$0.76Acquisition-related expenses4.00.13.8(0.1)0.01—————Gain on bargain purchase acquisition——(5.4)0.2(0.01)—————Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation——(11.9)2.0(0.02)——(7.5)1.2(0.01)Adjusted (non-GAAP) (ii) (iii)$623.920.4%$447.024.0%$0.72$648.820.7%$465.024.5%$0.75Six Months Ended June 30,20232022Net IncomeNet Incomeattributable toEffectiveattributable toEffectiveOperatingOperatingAmphenolTaxDilutedOperatingOperatingAmphenolTaxDilutedIncomeMargin (i)CorporationRate (i)EPSIncomeMargin (i)CorporationRate (i)EPSReported (GAAP)$1,211.620.1%$899.721.4%$1.45$1,238.620.3%$898.223.5%$1.44Acquisition-related expenses9.40.27.8(0.1)0.01—————Gain on bargain purchase acquisition——(5.4)0.1(0.01)—————Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation——(29.0)2.5(0.05)——(11.3)1.0(0.02)Adjusted (non-GAAP) (ii) (iii)$1,221.020.3%$873.124.0%$1.41$1,238.620.3%$886.924.5%$1.42FREE CASH FLOWThree Months EndedSix Months EndedJune 30,June 30,2023202220232022Operating Cash Flow (GAAP)$536.4$542.5$1,068.8$893.3Capital expenditures (GAAP)(95.4)(91.1)(193.1)(169.2)Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment (GAAP)0.81.01.62.8Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP) (iii)$441.8$452.4$877.3$726.9(i) While the terms ""operating margin"" and ""effective tax rate"" are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measures.(ii) All percentages and per share amounts in this table were calculated using actual, unrounded results; therefore, the sum of the components may not add due to rounding.(iii) The following are definitions of non-GAAP financial measures presented in the tables above, which may be referred to within this press release:Adjusted Operating Income is defined as Operating income (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income), excluding income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the periods presented.Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income).Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation is defined as Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the periods presented.Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as Provision for income taxes (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) expressed as a percentage of Income before income taxes (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income), each excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the periods presented.Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the periods presented. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined above, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income).Free Cash Flow is defined as (i) Net cash provided by operating activities (""Operating Cash Flow"" - as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP) less (ii) capital expenditures (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), net of proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), all of which are derived from the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure for the Company, as we believe it is useful for management and investors to assess our ability to generate cash, as well as to assess how much cash can be used to reinvest in the growth of the Company or to return to stockholders through either stock repurchases or dividends.AMPHENOL CORPORATIONSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATIONRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES - GUIDANCE(Unaudited)(dollars in millions, except per share data)Management utilizes the non-GAAP financial measures defined earlier as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Company’s financial performance, communicating operating results to the Company’s Board of Directors and assessing related employee compensation measures. Management believes that such non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors in assessing the Company’s overall financial performance, trends and period-over-period comparative results.

Such items are excluded from our guidance for the forward-looking periods only to the extent that such items have either (i) already been reflected in periods reported and are therefore included in the forward-looking full-year period or (ii) the Company reasonably expects to record such items in the forward-looking periods presented and such amounts are estimable. The Company estimates acquisition-related costs in the third quarter of 2023 in the range of approximately $5-$10 million ($0.01 per share) driven primarily by restructuring-related activities associated with the acquisition of RFS. As such, the third quarter 2023 guidance reflects the expected impact of these costs.(2) Per share amounts in this table were calculated using actual, unrounded results; therefore, the sum of the components may not add due to rounding.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230726281387/en/ContactsSherri ScribnerVice President, Strategy and Investor Relations203-265-8820IR@amphenol.com]"
308,289f0357-4200-32e2-9f94-f7f285e083b3,MAR,2023-07-26,Marriott International (MAR) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marriott-international-mar-earnings-expected-140127144.html,1690293687,STORY,['MAR'],"[The market expects Marriott International (MAR) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis hotel company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +21.7%.Revenues are expected to be $6.05 billion, up 13.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.86% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marriott?For Marriott, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +8.44%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Marriott will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Marriott would post earnings of $1.86 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.09, delivering a surprise of +12.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Marriott appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

VestbergThank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Me and my team are pleased to report another solid quarter as we continue to advance across all of our strategic key performance indicators. Our newly appointed leadership team remains committed to delivering on our key metrics, growth on wireless service revenue and expansion on consolidated adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.We're seeing operational improvements throughout our business and our results are strong. Wireless service revenue was up 3.8% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA was $12 billion for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was very strong in the quarter at $9.7 billion, and free cash flow was $5.6 billion. The actions we are taking to accelerate growth, improve operations and ensure a solid balance sheet are working. Our results today illustrate our ability to adapt, innovate and excel even in times of economic uncertainty, and we're encouraged by the growing importance of mobility, broadband and cloud services in the 5G era in all customer segments. Based on our results this quarter and what we see ahead, I'm confident that we will deliver on our 2023 financial guidance. This is a testament to the hard work and the dedication of our team.Now let's look more closely at the performance in mobility, private networks and national broadband. Our consumer wireless strategy of segmentation and financial discipline is paying off. This quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth in postpaid phone gross adds, significantly lower promo upgrade levels and a sequential improvement in postpaid churn, all according to our strategy. This work is a continuous process, and we're always looking for ways to do better.In May, we launched myPlan, a first-of-its-kind customized offering that gives our customers the value, control and simplicity they want. This aligns with our strategy of bringing our customers the best value on America's best network. While we still are in early days. myPlan has already helped our Verizon Consumer Group delivered notable operational improvements by encouraging customers to take on premium plans, which is driving higher ARPA. We're really excited for what to come from our new platform for selling consumer wireless services, and we are constantly evolving our offerings to fit customers' needs.We will also continue to invest in prepaid, to improve performance and expect sequential improvements in the second half of the year. As we reported in previous quarters, customer payments remain healthy, which shows both the financial strength of our customer base and the high value they place on our services.Our ongoing and effective strategy execution by Sampath and the consumer team supports a stronger Verizon, where we are the premium provider with elements like the new myPlan strategic regionalization, persistent cost transformation and a reinforced focus on customer satisfaction. We are strengthening our operational blueprint with a local emphasis and effectively positioning ourselves for sustainable growth.Verizon Business Group had yet another strong quarter driven by continued solid phone and fixed wireless access performance even as the secular decline in wireline continues. For the eighth quarter in a row, Verizon business contributed more than 125,000 postpaid phone net adds, demonstrating the resiliency of our service offering to all types of businesses and the value of our world-class network.On private networks, we won a mandate from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and we recently completed work to launch a next-generation private networking solution at the Cleveland Clinic that will support their mission for years to come. As a trusted partner to enterprise businesses, and federal government, we work closely to transform the networks and bring organizations onto the leading edge of technology development.The total addressable market of private wireless is expected to grow significantly, and Verizon is well positioned to capture meaningful share. Our broadband strategy delivered more than 400,000 net adds in the quarter on wireless and fixed wireless access, marking another quarter of remarkable broadband performance, this represents the third consecutive quarter with more than 400,000 net adds, demonstrating the momentum of our growth trajectory.We have established a high pace of customer growth, it's clear, fixed wireless access is here to stay as a proven competitive broadband product. We are well on track to meet our target of 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless access subscribers by the end of 2025 from a current base of nearly 2.3 million subscribers. We also now have an opportunity to segment the fixed wireless access market based on price, and speed tiers so that our customers can choose the service that best suits them. Further, we continue to see Net Promoter Scores of wireless and fixed wireless access that significantly exceed those of traditional cable offerings. We have the best network in the market. In the next couple of quarters, we will extend our lead with a last tranche of the C-band spectrum. For the 31st time in a row, Verizon was the most awarded brand for wireless network quality in J.D. Power's U.S. Wireless Network Quality Study, no other wireless provider has achieved this, and for 2023, we received top scores among all J.D. Power Study Factors in all 6 regions. Additionally, our team continues to innovate within our network, upgrading our infrastructure around the country and successfully testing our ability to slice our 5G network. Slicing will allow us to serve customers with dedicated 5G service on a large scale and to meet the diverse needs of the largest base of wireless customers in the United States. Next, I want to address the recent news about the legacy lead cable in our network. We take this matter seriously, and to be very clear, lead infrastructure makes up a small percentage of our copper network, and we began phasing away from installing new lead cable by the 1950s. At Verizon, the communities we serve and our employees are at the heart of everything we do, and we're using a fact and science-based approach in our assessment. You will hear more on the topic from Tony later on. Our accelerated plans for efficiency with our new structure, which we put in place over the last couple of quarters are already paying off. Verizon Global Services has taken action on a number of opportunities company-wide, realizing significant savings by focusing on IT platform transformation, leveraging artificial intelligence, rationalizing our real estate portfolio, and improving our supply chains.We're on track to achieve our forecasted $2 billion to $3 billion in annual savings by 2025, these savings in combination with the completion of the $10 billion C-band spend position us to generate strong cash flow and continue to invest in our business and pursue dividend increases as we execute on our capital allocation strategy. Now I will turn the call over to Tony to discuss our operations and financial performance in more detail.Anthony T. SkiadasThanks, Hans, and good morning. Our results for the second quarter demonstrate our progress towards our 3 priorities of growing wireless service revenue, delivering healthy consolidated adjusted EBITDA and increasing free cash flow. Our focus on execution is working and we remain on track to meet our financial guidance for 2023. We are happy with our progress, but we have more work to do. We are focused on continuing to improve our performance while remaining financially disciplined. In the second quarter, our consumer segment demonstrated better operating results both sequentially and year-over-year in postpaid phone net adds.Additionally, we experienced continued strong performance within our business segment both in terms of mobility and FWA subscriber growth. The results reflect the benefits of our ongoing C-band deployment and improved go-to-market execution. Consumer postpaid phone net losses totaled 136,000 for the quarter compared to 215,000 net losses in the second quarter of 2022. Consumer postpaid phone gross adds were strong once again up 6.9% year-over-year, driven by new to Verizon gross adds, which increased approximately 19% over the prior year period. We also saw notable growth in consumer postpaid ARPA which was up 6.2% year-over-year. The recent launch of myPlan reflects a more segmented and targeted approach. While it's still early, myPlan is driving a significantly higher premium mix with nearly 70% of myPlan customers taking the Unlimited Plus option. We are also encouraged by the step activity we are seeing. Consumer postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.76%, up 1 basis point compared with the same period last year. Higher involuntary churn drove the year-over-year increase, offsetting a modest improvement in voluntary churn. Our involuntary churn rates remain at pre-pandemic levels and were flat for the third consecutive quarter.It is important to note our performance in existing C-band markets. In the 46 markets where we initially deployed C-band, postpaid phone gross add growth was more than 100 basis points higher in the quarter than in non-C-band markets. Additionally, phone churn was 4 basis points lower in C-band markets, and our premium mix in C-band markets was 11 percentage points higher.Let's now look at our business results. Verizon business once again delivered solid performance and continues to expand on its industry-leading wireless market share. Demand continues to be strong in all 3 customer groups resulting in 144,000 phone net adds for the second quarter compared to 227,000 for the same period last year, which benefited from some large deals. As Hans mentioned, this marks the eighth consecutive quarter where we have delivered over 125,000 business phone net adds.We continue to win high-value business based on the strength of our network performance and value proposition. Notably, we had a recent government contract win where we took share from 2 of our competitors at attractive ARPUs. Moving on to broadband, we maintain our strong performance with 418,000 total broadband net additions in the second quarter. In the past 4 quarters, we've added more than 1.6 million broadband subscribers, growing our total broadband subscriber base by more than 21% during that time. Growth in FWA remained healthy with 384,000 net adds, up from 256,000 in the prior year period. We now have nearly 2.3 million customers on our FWA product that we expect growth to continue at a fairly similar pace in the third quarter. On the Fios side, Internet net adds for the second quarter were 54,000, up from 36,000 in the second quarter of last year. Despite continued softness in household move activity, gross adds rose year-over-year and our retention levels continue to be strong. Our value market team continues to take steps to address some of the softness we saw in the first half of the year.Prepaid net losses totaled 304,000 in the second quarter. Our year-to-date net add performance should represent a low point as we continue to make progress integrating TracFone while taking actions to better position us for growth including scaling our visible and total by Verizon brands. As Hans mentioned, we expect to see sequential improvements beginning in the third quarter. Let's now look at our financials, starting with consolidated revenue for the quarter, which was $32.6 billion, down 3.5% year-over-year. The decline can be attributed to reduced wireless equipment revenue which was nearly 21% lower than the prior year as postpaid phone upgrade activity declined 34% versus the same period last year.Service and other revenue grew 0.8%, driven by wireless service revenue growth. Total wireless service revenue was $19.1 billion, up 3.8% year-over-year and more than $200 million sequentially. In the second quarter, we continued to benefit from pricing actions including a recent change to our Verizon Mobile Protect offering. Additionally, the larger allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue and growth in fixed wireless access drove revenue improvements. These benefits were partially offset by continued pressure from the amortization of handset promotions. We are on track to deliver our wireless service revenue guidance for the year. We continue to assess opportunities to take targeted pricing actions to better monetize our products and services as we deliver great value for our customers. For example, we recently announced an increase in our FWA bundled pricing for new customers which we expect will provide service revenue benefits in the second half of the year. Additionally, we expect less pressure from the amortization of promotional costs in the second half of the year given the software upgrade environment and our disciplined approach to promotional spending. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $12 billion, up 0.8% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 160 basis points over the prior year, primarily driven by lower consumer postpaid upgrade volumes and improved service revenue. These benefits were partially offset by higher marketing expenses in the quarter related to the myPlan launch as well as a $194 million increase in bad debt year-over-year. Bad debt was relatively flat from the prior quarter and payment trends remain consistent with recent quarters and prepandemic levels. Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and special items were down 5.9% year-over-year, primarily due to lower cost of equipment from reduced upgrade volumes. As Hans mentioned, we continue to execute on our cost savings program, including through initiatives within our Verizon Global Services organization. During the quarter, we took actions to rationalize our workforce as we continue to see benefits from rationalizing certain legacy wireline products. We are on track to deliver $200 million to $300 million of savings this year from our transformation efforts and continue to make progress towards achieving our goal of $2 billion to $3 billion of annual cost savings by 2025.Cash flow from operating activities for the second quarter was $9.7 billion, and for the first half of the year totaled $18 billion compared to $17.7 billion in the prior year period. The increase continues to be related to working capital improvements associated with lower inventory levels and fewer upgrades which were offset in part by higher cash income taxes and interest expense. CapEx for the quarter came in at $4.1 billion, which reflects the completion of our $10 billion accelerated C-band program. Capital spending for the first half of the year totaled $10.1 billion, which was over $400 million less than last year. We continue to expect 2023 capital spending to be within our guidance of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion.Our peak capital spend is behind us, and we are now at a business-as-usual run rate for CapEx which we expect will continue into 2024. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the quarter of $5.6 billion. Free cash flow for the first half of the year is $8 billion and nearly $800 million improvement from the previous year, driven by a combination of our lower CapEx spend compared to the prior year and operating cash flow benefits previously mentioned.While we do not normally guide on free cash flow, our strong results give us a clear line of sight to more than $17 billion of free cash flow for the full year. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $126.6 billion, an improvement of $3.2 billion compared to the end of the previous quarter and $4.1 billion lower year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $4.8 billion of cash on hand. We are well positioned with respect to our unsecured debt maturities with no remaining obligations for the rest of the year. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6x as of the end of the second quarter a 0.1x improvement both sequentially and year-over-year.We continue to monitor the current interest rate environment closely given the recent comments from the Federal Reserve on planned rate increases later in the year. As previously stated, we expect higher interest expense to impact our full year earnings per share by $0.25 to $0.30, and there's no change to that view. Our strong second quarter results support our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged.Before I hand the call back to Hans, I'd like to address the recent media reports on lead-sheathed cables in our network. Here is what we currently know. We still have some lead-sheathed cable in our copper network. As a result of the age of this infrastructure and the history of the industry, records are incomplete as to exactly how much of the cable on our network has lead sheathing.However, to give you a sense of the scale of the infrastructure we are talking about, our copper network is comprised of less than 540,000 miles of cable, roughly half of which is aerial and lead-sheathed cable makes up a small percentage of our copper network. This number excludes the network elements previously owned by MCI and XO Communications because we are still reviewing the historical records of those companies. We're not disturbed the likelihood of exposure to lead from lead-sheathed cables is low. In addition, because the lead-sheathed cable was used as a feeder and distribution cable and does not run into individual homes or apartments it is generally in locations that minimize the potential for public contact.We are working with a third-party expert to conduct our own testing at our sites that were identified by the media. We will not have the results of our testing for several weeks. When we have the results of our testing, we will work closely with our industry and others to address any concerns and issues.Now I think it's important to address the question we've received from a lot of investors, which is about the process for and potential cost of removal of the lead-sheathed cable in our network. Given where we are in this process, it is far too soon to make any projection on what the potential financial impact might be to the company.There are a number of unknowns in this area, including whether there is a health risk presented by undisturbed lead sheet cable and if there is a risk, how that risk should be addressed. As a result, we do not believe there's a meaningful way to estimate any potential cost to the company or that any such estimate would even be useful. We won't be able to provide any additional color during the Q&amp;A session, as we have more information we can share on the topic, we will certainly do that. I will now turn the call back to Hans for his closing thoughts before we open it up to your questions.Hans E. VestbergThank you, Tony. As we pass the midpoint of 2023, I'm pleased by how we are effectively delivered on our priorities, and I'm confident that we will meet the financial goals we set for ourselves for the full year.To summarize, in mobility, our segmented and disciplined approach to the market is working, and our efforts to improve the Consumer Group's performance will continue throughout the second half of the year. In broadband, the combination of fixed wireless access and fiber is winning as we capitalize on the unique strength and capabilities of both technologies. We continue to have the best network in the market, and our leadership position will only get stronger as we continue to roll out C-band. While we're encouraged by the quarter's results. There's more work to be done. My leadership team and I are laser-focused on delivering what we committed to you at top of the year. Strong wider service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow as well as meeting our 203 financial guidance. By that, I hand it over to Brady for questions.Brady ConnorThanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take the first question.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS.John Christopher HodulikLooks like a nice beat on the consumer side, really driven by the postpaid ARPA growth of about 6%. Could you guys sort of pull that apart a little bit and maybe talk about the sustainability of that and the service revenue growth you saw as we head into the second half.I mean I think you've got some lap some price increases, but you've got some other price increases coming through and some of the promotional stuff rolling off. And then maybe just quickly on the lead. Obviously, you guys can't quantify it, but when you guys say low single -- low exposure of the 540,000 miles of copper, is that single digit? Can you guys tighten up that number for us a little bit? That would be great.Hans E. VestbergThank you, John. Let me start with the service revenue. I think we have been extremely focused on the service revenue. As you see in this quarter, we are expanding the growth from the first quarter, but it's many components, I understand you want to know a little bit more about the ARPA expansion, but we definitely see the broadband is adding to our growth. And then, of course, our wireless business side is doing extremely well as well. I mean 8 quarters, more than 125,000. So we're actually doing a lot of things in different areas. But then if you go to the Consumer Group, they have been really good the last couple of quarters right now to be segmenting, targeting the right offering with the right pricing for the customers.And myPlan has been playing in very well to that. And as you heard Tony talking about 70% of taking the premium plan. So -- but that's just the start of it. We're not done. But clearly, I'm confident that the team knows how to manage this, given how much we invested in research on the consumer side to understand our consumers better and that's why we launched myPlan. So all in all, I have to say the guys are doing well, but I'm confident we will continue on this ride. But maybe Tony can give you some more on that, and then we can come back to the lead.Anthony T. SkiadasYes. Thanks, Hans. So on the service revenue, we're very confident in the guide. You mentioned tough comps that we face in the second half. When you think about the second half of the year, let me unpack some of the drivers for you. As you know, we executed a number of targeted pricing actions between the price ups on the legacy unlimited plans that we did earlier in the quarter as well as most recently, changes to our handset insurance program and price changes on FWA bundles. Secondly, we had the introduction of myPlan back in May. That's helped with premium mix, and you heard that we're roughly 70% taking the Unlimited Plus plan. As Hans mentioned, we see an increase in contribution from fixed wireless access. We have 2.3 million subs in the base, and we have great momentum on FWA. And then fourth, we see continued improvements in year-over-year consumer postpaid volumes, and you saw that in the quarter. And then lastly, when you think about the promo amortization, the revenue impact from promotions and the promo amortization has decelerated in recent quarters. And that's -- it's basically a function of our disciplined approach to promotions and retention. So when you put that all together, we're very confident that all the initiatives here will continue to drive meaningful revenue growth in the second half.Hans E. VestbergOn the lead, as I said, we take this matter very seriously. And we're doing exactly what you expect from Verizon. We're doing this scientific and fact-based whereas Tony said, we're going over the different places that we pointed out by media and doing our own measurements with internal and external experts. And that's where we are. And we will do this very thorough. We are always doing things thorough. We do it fact-based, scientific and that's how we're going to do. And that's what you should expect from us.Anthony T. SkiadasYes. And John, we're still reviewing the records, and we mentioned that we're still reviewing the historical records of the former MCI and XO network. So that work is still ongoing as well. So we still have more work to do there. And as we learn more, we'll keep you updated.OperatorThe next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.Brett Joseph FeldmanI think I'll follow up on consumer volumes you alluded to in responding to John. It was great to see the consumer phone losses improve year-over-year, but I know your ambition is to do better than that. How do you think about the path getting back to net growth in consumer postpaid phones, do you think you're going to need to take further actions in terms of the product mix or pricing or even any additional internal adjustments? Or do you think you have the places -- pieces in place, and it's really just a matter of driving better execution against that framework.Hans E. VestbergI think it's about execution on the framework we have built right now. The guys have everything. Sampath and the team together with Tony and me with the full support. We have a new platform in myPlan. We have segmented above the market. We work with financial discipline. The target we have for our team is continue to do sequential growth. And as Sampath and the team said before, we -- ultimately, we want our fair share also on the net adds.But ultimately, we measure ourselves on service revenue growth. And as you can see, we continue to improve that. So it's more about now executing on this being patient and see that both the network is the best in the market, but it's just improving and some of the numbers that Tony talked about, you see the impact we have when the C-band is coming out.And then myPlan. You see also see that is now initially what we have talked about is actually giving us really good confidence that we're in the right place. So all that is in place. And then we do the regionalization as well at the same time. So a lot of things is in place. It's more about execution and doing it with a financial discipline that you should expect from Verizon.Brett Joseph FeldmanAnd how do we think about a time line for getting to sustainably positive net adds in consumer. Is that something that would be a reasonable expectation once you have C-band fully deployed?Anthony T. SkiadasBrett, it's Tony. So volumes are important to the business. And as we said before, we're going to be very disciplined on how we approach the market. Our focus is on volumes that drive profitable revenue growth. It's too soon to call third quarter positive for consumer. But as we said, we expect improvements year-over-year in consumer net adds and the team and Sampath and the team are very focused on that.Brady ConnorThanks Brett. Brad, we are ready for next question.OperatorThe next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.Simon William FlanneryI wanted to come back to the second phase of C-band. It was helpful to get those statistics. Could you just help us a little bit more in terms of what this is going to mean in terms of your footprint, both on the wireless side and on the fixed wireless side, how do we think that's going to help both coverage and also capacity.I know there's concerns in some quarters about fixed wireless facing congestion. It would be great to let us know what your experience has been with usage and how you feel good about handling that 4 million to 5 million and beyond over the next few years? And then maybe a quick 1 for Tony. Obviously, the stock has been under some pressure here, pretty high yield. Perhaps remind us about how you're thinking about potentially going to buybacks. You're seeing some deleveraging now strong free cash flow. Is that going to be an option here in the not-too-distant future.Hans E. VestbergThank you, Simon. When it comes to the C-band, I said we're ahead of the plan. As soon as we get hold of the next tranche of spectrum, the team is ready to continue to deploy that. That's going to give us both more capacity, but of course, more coverage as well. So it gave us both. And as you have seen in the numbers we talk about here, as soon as we deploy C-band, we get better uptake from our wireless customers. And of course, we'll open up fixed wireless access. So that should be positive over time for us. And when it comes to this lingering question about capacity, we don't have any capacity problems. I mean the guys are doing an enormously good job as always when it comes to Verizon and capacity, network planning. Joe and the team are on it all the time and seeing that we're doing the right for our customers.And remember, we are building a multipurpose network. That means that we have one radio that serve multiple opportunities, wireless, fixed wireless access, in some cases, private networks, so all that is in one, and that's the efficiency and the scale we're bringing right now, which we expected when we start with 5G and the C-band to see that we get the leverage model over time. But of course, it's going to roll out on the next year here. So I'm confident that this will create more opportunities for us now when we get hold of the next tranche of the C-band spectrum.Anthony T. SkiadasOkay, Simon. And then on your question on the cash generation, we're very pleased with the cash generation of the business. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $4.8 billion, which was very strong and reflective of our strong free cash flow results that it is higher -- running higher than normal. As a reminder, we do have about $4.5 billion of the C-band clearing obligations remaining and due soon, and that's obviously a priority for us.The cash generation, as I said, is strong, gives us optionality and supports a much improved dividend payout ratio. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. We said, first, we would invest in the business. The second priority is our commitment to the dividend. Our third priority is to delever, and you'll see us be focused on that. And then once we get to the leverage metric of 2.25, we will consider buybacks at that time.Brady ConnorThanks, Simon, Brad, we are ready for next question.OperatorThe next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.Philip A. CusickWith the price increases and the impact of the new pricing structure, it looks like you're trending above the midpoint of service revenue growth. I mean, it could be closer to the high end. Any reason to think it decelerates from here?And then second, Hans, you spoke on private wireless. Can you dig into the market opportunity there? And how long it takes for that to be a $1 billion business?Hans E. VestbergI'll start with the second question, and Tony can come back on the first. On the private wireless, what we have found out during the work we've been doing is that private 5G networks is something really, really valuable for enterprises and SMBs. And the main reason is that the capacity on it, the speed and the security, it basically starts as a Wi-Fi replacement on license spectrum. And then you start adding on to it.Usually it start with 1 factory. And if you see that are working there, they do it in all factories. We have a growing list of new customers coming in, in the first phase. I would say this is a new business for us that again, is building on the same investment, the same Verizon Intelligent Edge Network. I should expect that it's $1 billion business this year. But it definitely over time, this is a very important lever for Kyle and his team for growth in the service revenue and actually doing even better in the -- with enterprises. So it's going to take some time, but I'm really pleased with what I've seen in the last couple of quarters, how this is turning out. And I would say we have now an ecosystem with devices, with radio base stations, with integrators and all of that, which we haven't had before. So I'm more optimistic than a long time that private networks will be something. And as you know, I mean, we were way ahead of anybody else on this field. And that's why I feel really confident we will take more than our fair share.Anthony T. SkiadasPhil. And then on the service revenue, as we mentioned upfront, we have some tough comps as we lap the price up from last year. We do expect sequential improvements in the third quarter. One thing to note, just on the prepaid revenue, we did see a headwind in the quarter of about $125 million. I would expect that to be at a similar level in the third quarter before it eases up in the fourth quarter, that's probably 1 additional data point for you.Brady ConnorThanks, Phil, Brad, we are ready for next question.OperatorThe next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.Frank Garrett LouthanCan you walk us through the correlation between the broadband adds and the business wireless adds, including both the Fios and fixed wireless? And then you mentioned expecting some software upgrades. Are you anticipating having to subsidize any more for handsets to get adds as the year goes on?Hans E. VestbergOn the broadband side, I think I got the question like that the correlation between the fixed wireless access and the Fios. I mean, let me say that on the fixed wireless access right now, we are growing that base, of course, mainly outside the ILEC because that's just how it is because the Fios is so strong. So we're doing great on the Fios business. And as you have seen, even though it's a softer housing movement season than before, we're doing great. I mean, over 50,000 again on Fios. So Fios is doing really well.And then, of course, we have a portion of converged customers that is now growing. It's not growing that to come to European levels or something, but it's growing. The good thing for us is we have owner's economics on everything, fixed wireless access, wireless, Fios, we have 1 network, we are our own fiber. And that, of course, gives us opportunity to meet customer demands if they want converges or not and that nobody else has in the industry. So really pleased with the development of broadband for us. We outlined this as 1 of the most important 5G innovations we've done. We have substantial new customers there. So this is a great opportunity and as you saw right now we continue doing as we have done. I mean we have now 2.3 billion customers on fixed wireless access. We can now start with different tiers, different pricings, so we can meet customer demands that have different requirements. And that's just good for us, but it's also really good for our customers because they can choose between different models, depending on what needs they have.Anthony T. SkiadasYes. And the only other thing I would add is that we have a great rhythm at 400,000 broadband net adds in the quarter. And again, another -- the third consecutive quarter of over 400,000 broadband net adds, and we continue to see good momentum with customers taking -- wireless customers taking FWA and we see great progress there as well.Hans E. VestbergAnd then you had a question on upgrades. And as you have seen, and promos. That is clearly down in the second quarter and the first quarter as well. There are many reasons where some are, of course, that we are much more financially disciplined. That's very important. But it also haven't been in any major new devices coming out. It will probably come on in the second half. It usually comes, so we're going to see that. But I don't foresee that we will come back to the levels we've seen before from a point of view of Verizon. We think that we're going to be disciplined. We're going to offer devices and promos and upgrades where there is the best for the segment and for the customer, but will not come back to the levels that we saw before.Brady ConnorThanks, Frank. Brad, we are ready for next question.OperatorThe next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.David William BardenSo I wanted to come back to the relationship between Verizon and the cable industry. Before the lead, this was the big issue. And if there were 2 pillars to the idea behind the relationship between Verizon and the cable industry, one was that somehow Verizon had negotiated a deal with the cable industry that they would guarantee to make money no matter how much data cable consumers took. And the second was that, that deal would never end. It was going to be forever. And so I feel like the messaging on that has started to change from Verizon a little bit and that maybe that the idea that cable industry is guaranteed to make money in the relationship between Verizon and cable regardless of data consumption, that's not true.And then this deal isn't permanent, it could change at some future time, even though the DOJ, obviously, you need to have a some deal, but it doesn't have to be this deal. And I was wondering if you could kind of just address that for us right now.Hans E. VestbergDavid, thank you for the question. This is a complex area. And remember, many of these things we cannot talk about. We have NDA's when it comes to our contracts. The only thing that I'm securing is that Verizon is making money on this, that's I can tell you, and we think this is an important business. These are important customers to us. And again, I go back to what I talked about before. We build the network once. The more connections and more usage and the more revenue we have on it, the better return on capital it is. And as long as we see that's happening, we will continue the work we're doing, however, I cannot go into specifics on the contracts because, first of all, I'm not allowed to do it. So -- but clearly, you should feel confident that Verizon is doing that with the best interest of our stakeholders and our shareholders. So -- and we want to get the best return on our invested capital in the network.Brady ConnorThanks, Dave. Brad, we are ready for next question.OperatorThe next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.Michael Ian RollinsTwo questions, if I could. First, just following up on the comments around tiering of fixed wireless and potentially on speed, is there also an opportunity to begin tiering mobile 5G wireless in terms of megabits per second rather than a historical way of tiering on gigabytes per month of consumption? And then just secondly, you mentioned that the cash CapEx is tracking to guidance. But just curious, as you're deploying the mid-band spectrum, the depth of it, and seeing what the propagation is, are there opportunities to get further efficiencies in capital and potentially go below the business as usual indication of CapEx for 2024.Hans E. VestbergMike, thank you for the question. On the question about different models over time, how we can charge for 5G., I think we find a good model within myPlan right now with different type of network options, then you can take your perks. All of it is accretive for us. You should see the first sort of launch here as the first time we come out with the platform.We see multiple opportunities, how you can sort of diverse that 1 in different ways to meet different customer demands. So you will probably see more of that going forward, how we'll do that. So clearly, very important to us that we continue to meet our customers with new plans and things like that. But now we have a great base that is myPlan.On the CapEx side, I think we have gone over sort of a fairly long harm here coming from Verizon Intelligent Edge Network, investing in fiber, investing to -- in all the parts of millimeter wave, then coming into the harm of C-band, now we come into the BAU. As far as we can see right now, is BAU is around 17% to 17.5%. And that's going to see that we can deploy the C-band, getting all the benefits we talked about is coming down. Fiber is more success-based. So there's a lot of things happening in there, but we're really confident that we can be on those levels, and our team is really doing a great job.Brady ConnorThanks, Mike. Brad, we are ready for next question.OperatorThe next question comes from Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson.Craig Eder MoffettTwo questions, if I could. First, if I could return to the lead topic for 1 moment. Can you just talk about the extent to which you used overlashing of fiber to what might potentially be lead cables particularly in your aerial plant in the Northeast. And then second, I just wonder if you could just help us think about the trajectory going forward of fixed wireless, which has seemingly sort of steadied out to a relatively stable number. Is that what we should expect because that would take us a bit higher than your guidance by the end of 2025. So I'm just wondering how we think about the pacing of fixed wireless.Hans E. VestbergThank you, Craig. I'll start with the fixed wireless access question because I think that is an important one. And the lead, we will hear from Tony on that one. On the fixed wireless access, you're right. I mean we are now running on a fairly high level, adding broadband subscriber quarter. Remember, -- we have defined -- we are roughly in, I would say, a little bit over 70% of the PAs of C-band so far out of 402, so that, of course, is how many OFS or open for sales, we can do right now. So that is a little bit -- the next step is going to be the next tranche coming in. And I said, we're well ahead for the 4 million to 5 million, the team is doing a great job. We also saw that we now are doing some great work on how we can address MDUs in a very efficient way. We're in the beginning of that. So all in all, I think that fixed wireless access and how we're managing our network is going great. And of course, as an ambitious leader, as I am, I expect that we can do better, of course. But right now, that's the forecast we have, 4 million to 5 million. And we are really doing well. And the customer satisfaction on fixed wireless access is so good. It's so simple. You install it yourself. You get broadband immediately.So we're just meeting a consumer demand that no 1 else is doing basically. So I'm really pleased with the product. We talked about this being 1 of the most important 5G applications, and now you can see what it means to us and how important it's going to be over time.Anthony T. SkiadasAnd then, Craig, on the lead, as we said earlier, it's a small part of our network. It's about 50% aerial. We said we're still reviewing the historical records, both former MCI network and the former XO copper network. So we still have work to do there. We're going to take a very methodical approach, very fact-based, very scientific-based approach. And as we know everyone wants more information. And as we learn more, we'll keep you updated.Brady ConnorThanks, Craig. Brad, we are ready for next question.OperatorThe next question comes from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank.Bryan D. KraftI want to ask 2, if I could. I guess, First, just on the lead issue, I was wondering if you thought this might lead to an acceleration in copper network retirements and therefore, an accelerated reduction in fixed costs for legacy networks. It seems like an opportunity in cases where communities might want to not have lead cable in their communities, even if it isn't actually shedding any lead.And then secondly, I just had a follow-up to Simon's question earlier. Can you talk about how the remaining C-band deployments will affect the fixed wireless opportunity in rural areas? Specifically, how much of an expansion in the rural footprint will that represent versus the available footprint today for fixed wireless, and would that include a lot of areas that aren't served by anything today, except for copper infrastructure, so kind of the true rural areas?Hans E. VestbergSo on the first one, we have always a plan for network transformation that we continue going. That has not changed. When it comes to this lead-sheathed cables discussion, as said, I mean, we're going to go through this scientific, we're going to do test. We're going to do it fact-based and then we'll come back. But we have a normal network transformation that we constantly do because Kyle and team are doing that in order to keep up with the pressure of the secular decline in wireline, so he will continue to do that, and we do that all the time.On the second question on fixed wireless access, yes, of course, when we -- the first 70, i would say ish, I would say is C-band mark PEAs that is called, they are mainly in urban areas. And that's where we have had that good traction on fixed wireless access. In the next step, it's going to be much more suburban and rural. And of course, that's great opportunity because usually, they are even less different options for customers in those areas. So of course, that's going to create opportunity for us. That doesn't mean that we are changing our guidance. We still say 4 million to 5 million by 2025. Of course, the team is always driving hard here, and I am driving hard. We always want to achieve. We want to show our stakeholders that we are a great company and we execute well, which I think we're doing. So definitely, we see opportunities were coming with the next tranche of C-band.Brady ConnorThanks, Bryan. Brad, we are ready for next question.OperatorThe next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. .Timothy Kelly HoranOn the wholesale -- on the cable side, maybe just discuss the wholesale wireless ARPUs broadly speaking. Do you think you can grow wholesale wireless ARPUs. And then the $10 increase in fixed wireless pricing, do you think that would slow kind of sub growth quarterly, obviously good strength there? And then lastly, on the lead side, can you just qualitatively talk how often are your workers exposed to lead? I'm sure you have to log that. And what do you do to kind of protect workers? And have you ever seen any claims from workers on lead poisoning.Hans E. VestbergThere were many questions in all there. So let me start by the change of discounts that we did on fixed wireless access again, we have a premium product. We have different type of optionalities for our customers in order to pick and choose with the best years or what the best service is. So we think that this is just natural when you have passed over 2 million subscribers on fixed wireless access. And I think you just think about when we started with unlimited, you start with 1 plan and then you start to work with different segmentation because ultimately, we are in a very, very big consumer business, where so many differentiated shaded customers that needs different type of services. So just think about it as a very natural step for us in order to serve our customers in a good way. Then I hand it over to Tony for the next question.Anthony T. SkiadasYes. On the cable partnership, I mean, as Hans mentioned, we don't go into the details. I mean, we continue to see volume growth in the relationship, and we're very satisfied with the relationship and we continue to monetize the network, as Hans said earlier.Timothy Kelly HoranAnd then on the worker lead exposure?Anthony T. SkiadasWe continue to work across the company and continue to take a methodical approach. We're not going to get into any specifics around employees or anything. But as we said, we'll keep you posted as we learn more.Brady ConnorThanks, Tim. Brad, we are ready for next question.OperatorNext question comes from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research.Peter Lawler SupinoI wanted to ask 2, 1 on upgrade rates and the other on FWA. On upgrade rates, I wondered if you could discuss why they've fallen so much. And whether it's sustainable what the risks are to a recent trend and on FWA. I just wonder if you could discuss the service price increase that we learned about this week.Hans E. VestbergOn the upgrade rates, as I said before, I mean, first of all, we at Verizon has been very disciplined in how to offer sort of products and services with the right price at the right time. So definitely that has been that we are actually doing less promos and less upgrades, that has not hampered our way of growing our business or taking customers, and we will continue to work with that.Then, of course, hasn't been any major product coming out in the market. We expect there's going to be a product coming out in the second half. We're excited over that. And of course, that's going to drive upgrades and promos, of course. But again, we will continue to be very financially disciplined. But of course, we're excited for these type of things as it attracts store traffic. And when store traffic comes we are really good and having a good conversion rate, adding things to it to our customers, which is really, really important.And then second, on the fixed wireless access, taking away the discount, and again, we come to a level of 2.3 million fixed wireless customer. There are so many different type of customers and consumers we have. So of course, having different tiers and pricing becomes very normal in order to meet customer demands. So it's just how we do, and that will continue to do and see how the market is developing.Brady ConnorBrad, we have time for one more question.OperatorThe final question for today will come from Walter Piecyk of LightShed.Walter Paul PiecykI just want to actually do a follow-up to that upgrade question. The last 2 years, Hans, the upgrade rate has actually declined in the third quarter. So I just want to kind of piece meal together, like you said you're not going to do handset promotions earlier in the call.Obviously, everyone knows Apple comes out with a new product, but in the last answer, it sounded like you thought people would upgrade more, but what, what seasonal trends should we see here? I assume you're still expecting it to be down year-on-year, but what about sequentially because it's been typically down sequentially in the third quarter for the last 2 quarters, maybe COVID had some impact on that, I don't know.And then my second question on CapEx. There's some debate, I think a lot of the tower companies specifically are trying to drive this narrative of like, oh, your C-band is going to get deployed, but they're doing fixed wireless and all these things, you're going to have to come back and do densification very quickly.So any lull in CapEx will be short-lived. I'm just curious, I mean, obviously, we saw the CapEx drop very quickly here in this quarter. How long do you think this kind of CapEx holiday will exist before you need to come back and use densification in the absence of additional spectrum sourced by the FCC?Hans E. VestbergYes. Thank you. On the upgrade, I cannot -- I don't know anything about any launch of the product, how exciting it's going to be. But ultimately, that usually drives more upgrades. So let's see what's going to happen this time and when it comes out. But we're always excited to see Apple coming out with a new phone. Hopefully, they are coming in this half. I cannot reveal what they are doing. But clearly, we're excited for that.On the CapEx, yes, you should talk to us. We know more about this than other companies. I would say we have a really good, sustainable level of this densification, it's part of our strategy already. So -- and many of the things that we're already are deploying on C-band, we deploy sort of for the full spectrum already from the beginning, then we turn on when we get those tranches.So there's a lot of things that my team has done over years in order to be as efficient as possible on CapEx. That's why I feel really good on our sort of BAU around 17% to 17.5%. I feel really good about that because we go through this extremely detailed. So we feel confident.Brady ConnorYes. Thanks, Walt. Brad, that was all the time we had for today.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect. .]"

SWK is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 1, before market open.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, while missing in one. The average beat was 25.3%. Let’s see how things have shaped up for Stanley Black this earnings season.Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseStanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseStanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteStanley Black’s second-quarter performance is likely to have been hurt by a decline in volumes due to a soft demand environment. Given the company’s substantial international operations, adverse foreign currency movements might have dampened its revenues. We expect the company’s total revenues to decline 6.7% from the year-ago reported figure.Reduced retail and consumer demand within the Power and Hand Tools division is expected to have weighed on the Tools &amp; Outdoor segment’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for Tools &amp; Outdoor segment revenues indicates a 7.5% decline from the year-ago reported figure.Softer industrial markets are expected to have hurt the Industrial segment’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. We expect the segment’s revenues to dip 2.6% from the year-ago reported figure.However, pricing actions, productivity gains and strength in aerospace and auto markets are likely to have supported Stanley Black’s second-quarter performance. Cost-control initiatives are expected to have aided its bottom line and supported margins.What Does the Zacks Model SayOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Stanley Black this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here, as elaborated below.Earnings ESP: Stanley Black has an Earnings ESP of -0.18%. You can uncover the best stocks before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Stanley Black presently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Story continuesHighlights of Q1 EarningsStanley Black incurred a loss of 41 cents per share in the first quarter of 2023, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 73 cents. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported earnings of $2.10 per share. Net Sales of $3,931.8 million declined 11.6% year over year, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,002 million.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies within the broader Industrial Products sector, which according to our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.Emerson Electric Co. EMR has an Earnings ESP of +2.35% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is scheduled to release third-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30, 2023) results on Aug 2.

319,0c73ce23-aecc-38d3-bc42-020a484add4d,SWK,2023-07-26,Analysts Estimate Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-stanley-black-decker-140140283.html,1690293700,STORY,"['SWK', 'LECO']","[Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis tool company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.38 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -121.5%.Revenues are expected to be $4.12 billion, down 6.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.17% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Stanley Black &amp; Decker?For Stanley Black &amp; Decker, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.18%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Stanley Black &amp; Decker will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Stanley Black &amp; Decker would post a loss of $0.73 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.41, delivering a surprise of +43.84%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Stanley Black &amp; Decker doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerLincoln Electric Holdings (LECO), another stock in the Zacks Manufacturing - Tools &amp; Related Products industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $2.32 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +6.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.1 billion, up 13.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Lincoln Electric has been revised 0.8% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -2.59%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Lincoln Electric will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF, iShares Semiconductor ETF, First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF and Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF have gained 22.6%, 21.8%, 17.6% and 21.9%, respectively, over the past three months.The strong trend is likely to continue in the weeks ahead as the Q2 earnings season picks up pace (read: Best &amp; Worst ETF Areas of First Half 2023).Semiconductors have been the most important drivers of the overall growth in technology, given the use of chips in day-to-day life, from cars to electronic gadgets to planes and weapons. Demand will continue to trend higher, given increased digitization in various corners like healthcare, transport, financial systems, defense, agriculture and retail, among others.The rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology like cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, AI, cryptocurrencies, 5G and other advanced information technologies should continue to fuel growth. Further, the introduction of expensive and new-generation chips has led to an enhancement in the product mix for semiconductors.Some well-known players in the space, such as Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), will report earnings in the coming days. Let’s delve into the financial picture of the companies that have a higher allocation in the above-mentioned ETFs and the power they have to move the funds up or down as Q2 earnings unfold. SMH is largely concentrated on these four firms with a combined share of 33.5%, followed by 27.5% for SOXQ, 26.1% for SOXX and 22% for FTXL.Story continuesPer our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

At the 2016 awards ceremony, Jennifer Rumsey, Cummins' current Chief Executive Officer, was then Chief Technical Officer. She announced the company goal to certify 40 sites to ISO 50001 by 2020. Cummins has since exceeded this goal by expanding the ISO 50001 certification to 45 sites.The award is part of the CEM Energy Management Leadership Awards program. To enter the awards program, Cummins Facilities and Operations Environmental Center of Excellence developed and submitted a detailed case study describing its experiences and results using ISO 50001 at 45 of its sites across eight countries. The company's award-winning case study is available on the CEM website as a resource for other organizations interested in achieving significant and enduring energy and cost savings.In the case study, Cummins described key aspects of its ISO 50001-certified energy management system and identified resulting benefits from 2018 to 2021, including:Total energy cost savings (cumulative total savings for 45 sites) of $183,775,216.Total CO2 equivalent emission reductions of 2,297,587 metric tons.A 9% absolute energy reduction.An 18% greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction.The ISO 50001 standard is a cost-effective framework that enables organizations to take control of their energy use and continually improve performance, reducing costs and emissions. Regardless of an organization's size or sector, the framework helps maintain and build energy and cost savings year after year.Story continuesPLANET 2050, Cummins' environmental sustainability strategy, sets quantifiable goals for 2030 along with longer-term aspirations timed to 2050. This includes the 2030 goal of an absolute GHG reduction from facilities and operations of 50%.A 50% absolute carbon emissions reduction by 2030 from a base year of 2018 is a target consistent with the level of decarbonization required to keep global temperature rise to below 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial temperatures.Cummins Inc., Tuesday, July 25, 2023, Press release pictureGlobal power technology leader Cummins Inc.'s headquarters in Columbus, Indiana.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cummins-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/770156/Cummins-Honored-for-Energy-Management-Efforts]"

(AP) — ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro said the network could take on a sports league as a minority partner as the network continues its transition from a cable channel to a digital company.“I will emphasize that we believe there are parties out there that can help us on the content side. So you can draw whatever conclusions you want from that,” Pitaro said Tuesday during a seminar sponsored by CNBC and Boardroom, a sports media company founded by Kevin Durant.Pitaro declined to say which leagues have been in talks with him and Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger, but he said there has “been a healthy level of interest” from leagues as well as technology, marketing and distribution companies.Pitaro also said it is not a question of if but when ESPN will roll out a direct-to-consumer product to view its offerings.A league having an equity stake in a network like ESPN would be groundbreaking and would pose some questions about fairness and objectivity in coverage. It would mark another step in sports’ relationship with its broadcast partners.Some teams have equity stakes in regional sports networks, while all four major U.S. professional leagues have their own channels.Some have also wondered about ESPN’s future within the framework of Disney, which Pitaro tried to address by saying, “Bob (Iger) has been clear about the power of live sports and power of the ESPN brand, how important it is to the future of the Walt Disney Company.”With cable audiences continuing to shrink, a direct-to-consumer option would help recoup some financial losses. According to its most recent filing, ESPN has 72.5 million cable subscribers and 25.3 million for its ESPN+ streaming service.There is no timetable for ESPN releasing a direct-to-consumer product, which would give consumers a way to view programming from ESPN's channels without a cable subscription. ESPN+ subscribers currently still need a cable subscription to access that content.Story continuesLionTree Chairman and CEO Aryeh Bourkoff said it would be tough for ESPN to go it alone as it transitions from linear to digital and that partnerships have become as crucial for businesses as much as mergers and acquisitions.Bourkoff compared ESPN’s transition to Netflix's move from a DVD-by-mail service to streaming, and Amazon expanding from online book sales into Prime Video and its own branded products.“You are shifting from a linear model that has existed for a long time to a model where digital and technology companies are all competing against each other,” Bourkoff said. “You have to be properly aligned. I think there’s a way to bring all that together that preserves the upside but also cash flow. I think people have to come together to make this happen.”___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports]"

Atlantic Equities analysts downgrade Disney's stock and lower its price target. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal, Akiko Fujita, and Brad Smith look at several trending stocks after the closing bell.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Shares of Spotify, they're tanking today following second quarter results that disappointed investors as gross margins missed analyst expectations. The music streaming giant also hiked the cost of its premium subscription.Let's take a look at shares right now. They're down by about 14%. That's where they end the day. So not quite its worst trading day on session, but it ain't great here. Ultimately, we were looking through some of these results.We've got Alex now here with us on set to help us really round out this conversation. Wasn't quite a miss on the MAUs. They beat in that category though--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Oh, yeah. Subscribers is--BRAD SMITH: Yeah.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --doing very well, paying users doing very well. It seems like investors are concerned that the price hikes which went up by $1 for the premium plan that that's going to negatively impact subscribers moving forward which has really been the lifeline for this company.Another metric that investors have closely kept their eye on is gross margins. That disappointed in the quarter. It's been declining. We did see an upbeat surprise in the last earnings report which did fuel some gains then. So I think the fact that we're reversing that right now is a concern for investors.But a lot of this has to do with a few different headwinds, one, being foreign exchange. Another being the fact that royalties-- the cost of royalties are higher. And also Spotify is streamlining its podcast business. So there are greater losses around cuts to that unit. I think there's going to be continued cuts to come based on some of the results that we did get here.Story continuesWe saw revenue missed estimates. We saw losses widen. We also saw free cash flow. Although it was positive, it was down sequentially and year over year. So profitability just continues to be a struggle for this company. And investors don't really seem to have the patience anymore, but analysts are really preaching the long-term game for Spotify.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. Although, interestingly, when you look at podcast advertising revenue, we've been talking about how much money they spent on that. They were accelerated to more than 30% year on year. So things at least on that front--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah,AKIKO FUJITA: I mean, I guess it's about the cost and the investment versus the revenue that's coming.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Exactly. And they say they are going to take a very strategic approach to their podcast investments. So that means really leaning in on the podcast that are doing well and getting rid of those that maybe aren't. We saw them part ways with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. That was a very--AKIKO FUJITA: Very costly endeavor,ALEXANDRA CANAL: --costly endeavor. So that's something that they're going to continue to do throughout 2023. But clearly, right now, with the stock down so much, investors weren't too happy. But look at that year-to-date performance. I mean, it's up more than 75%. So this is a stock that has really battled back some serious lows.AKIKO FUJITA: Let's talk about another stock we've been watching closely today. Shares of 3M closing the day higher following the company's latest earnings report. The industrial conglomerate posted $7.99 billion in revenue beating analyst estimates of $7.87 billion.The company also raised its full-year earnings guidance and reaffirmed its revenue guidance. Guys, this is a company that is still very much in transition. They've really leaned in on the high growth businesses like climate tech, like semiconductors.There's still a big overhang though and it is the legal settlements for this company. There is the settlement, the $10 billion settlement from last month on the forever chemicals, that we like to call, contaminating drinking water. There's a slew of liabilities that they're still having to clear. That continues to be an overhang. But when you take that out of the picture, things looking to the upside for the company.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, and, like, we've been talking about-- with a lot of these companies and their earnings, if you're able to boost that outlook and boost that guidance, that is a positive and you're going to be rewarded by investors. I also think a company like 3M which is very diversified, it helps so you can lean on different sectors of the business.For example, automotives was very strong in the quarter. Health care was also up slightly. That helped offset some of those lower growth units like safety and industrials, for example. Those sales fell 5.4% in the quarter. But you're right. Despite that large second quarter loss, the fact that we did get that adjusted profit beat by a pretty significant margin on top of that outlook raise, I think that's a positive for 3M moving forward.BRAD SMITH: Absolutely here. We're also tracking shares of Disney this afternoon. Shares of the ""House of Mouse"" closing the day in negative territory, down by about 1% following a downgrade to underperform from neutral by Atlantic Equities analyst Hamilton Faber who also lowered his price target on the media giant from $70-- or $276 from $113.Faber citing concerns around Disney's linear advertising saying, it's clear that advertising is set to fall far faster, far faster than they have seen previously there. And you're seeing that reflected in the shares of Disney here on the day as well, Allie.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, Disney is just a company that's dealing with a few problems, right? I mean, we have this slowdown in their franchise business. The box office, for example. We've seen some of those Marvel movies struggle. And that's going to have a ripple effect to Disney Plus.Coupled with that, we've had an animation slowdown of sorts. And then in the background is this double Hollywood strike. And we're already starting to see the impact there with the company reportedly pushing some of those film schedules to adjust for the strike. So that's something that we're going to continue to watch.Outside of films, there's the uncertainty surrounding the macro environment. You mentioned the decline in linear networks. I mean, Bob Iger, he's clearly not married to them. He already hinted that he would be open to selling some of those TV assets. But who would be the buyer there? So there's a lot of uncertainty.Sports is continuing to do well. But then there's the question of when Disney will take ESPN fully over the top. There were reports that they're already holding strategic partnership conversations with major leagues like the NFL. We'll see if that comes to fruition. But there are a lot of unanswered questions, when it comes to Disney. And a lot is going to be riding on this earnings report.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, a company that really clearly wants to accelerate into digital but still has the weight coming from linear. A lot of transitions still happening on that front.]"

(NYSE:OKE) Is About To Go Ex-Dividend, And It Pays A 5.7% Yield",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oneok-inc-nyse-oke-ex-100233198.html,1690365753,STORY,['OKE'],"[Readers hoping to buy ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase ONEOK's shares before the 31st of July to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of August.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.95 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$3.82 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that ONEOK has a trailing yield of 5.7% on the current share price of $67.54. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether ONEOK can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for ONEOK Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. ONEOK paid out 71% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the last year it paid out 69% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see ONEOK's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 33% per annum for the past five years. The current payout ratio suggests a good balance between rewarding shareholders with dividends, and reinvesting in growth. With a reasonable payout ratio, profits being reinvested, and some earnings growth, ONEOK could have strong prospects for future increases to the dividend.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. ONEOK has delivered 11% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid ONEOK? Higher earnings per share generally lead to higher dividends from dividend-paying stocks over the long run. However, we'd also note that ONEOK is paying out more than half of its earnings and cash flow as profits, which could limit the dividend growth if earnings growth slows. To summarise, ONEOK looks okay on this analysis, although it doesn't appear a stand-out opportunity.On that note, you'll want to research what risks ONEOK is facing. To that end, you should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with ONEOK (including 1 which is significant).Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Oneok Inc. (OKE), which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production Pipeline - MLB industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This natural gas company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 9.46%.For the last reported quarter, Oneok came out with earnings of $2.34 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07 per share, representing a surprise of 13.04%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.02 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.08 per share, delivering a surprise of 5.88%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Oneok lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Oneok currently has an Earnings ESP of +6.24%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on August 7, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

VZ reported mixed second-quarter 2023 results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The telecom giant is witnessing significant 5G adoption and fixed wireless broadband momentum. Strong demand for Fios and fixed wireless products also led to healthy broadband performance with total broadband net additions of 418,000.Verizon witnessed solid traction in the wireless business with 8,000 total postpaid phone net additions in the quarter along with retail postpaid net additions of 612,000. This buoyed the shares in pre-market trading.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net income in the quarter was $4,766 million or $1.10 per share compared with $5,315 million or $1.24 per share in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year decrease despite lower operating expenses was primarily attributable to top-line contraction.Excluding non-recurring items, quarterly adjusted earnings per share were $1.21 compared with $1.31 in the prior-year quarter.

The top line missed the consensus estimate of $33,390 million.Quarterly Segment ResultsConsumer: Total revenues from this segment declined 4.1% year over year to $24,558 million, as higher service revenues were more than offset by lower equipment revenues in the quarter. However, it exceeded our revenue estimate of $23,891 million for the segment led by solid wireless momentum.Service revenues were up 2.7% to $18,641 million, while wireless equipment revenues slumped 22.4% to $4,430 million. Other revenues totaled $1,487 million, down 14.9% year over year.The segment recorded 136,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net losses and 304,000 wireless retail prepaid net losses in the quarter. Wireless retail postpaid churn was 0.95%, while retail postpaid phone churn was 0.76%. The company recorded 51,000 Fios Internet net additions as high demand for reliable fiber optic broadband was spurred by increasing work-from-home trend. Fixed wireless broadband net additions were 251,000 for the quarter. However, Verizon registered 69,000 Fios Video net losses in the quarter, reflecting the ongoing shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings.The segment’s operating income improved 2.5% to $7,330 million on lower operating expenses with a margin of 29.8%, up from 27.9% in the year-ago quarter. EBITDA increased 2.1% to $10,577 million with a margin of 43.1% compared with 40.5% in the prior-year quarter due to lower costs of wireless equipment.Business: The segment revenues were down 1.9% to $7,483 million due to lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues, partially offset by growth in wireless service revenue. It also was lower than our estimates of $7,657 million largely due to challenging macroeconomic conditions.The segment had 308,000 wireless retail postpaid net additions in the quarter, including 144,000 postpaid phone net additions. Wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.48%, while retail postpaid phone churn was 1.10%. Fixed wireless broadband net additions were 133,000 for the quarter. Operating income declined to $533 million from $675 million in the year-ago quarter with respective margins of 7.1% and 8.9%.

The improvement was primarily due to working capital improvements driven by lower inventory levels, fewer phone upgrades and a modest improvement in customer payment patterns.

With the consensus EPS estimate being $2.86, the EPS surprise was +12.24%.While investors closely watch year-over-year changes in headline numbers -- revenue and earnings -- and how they compare to Wall Street expectations to determine their next course of action, some key metrics always provide a better insight into a company's underlying performance.Since these metrics play a crucial role in driving the top- and bottom-line numbers, comparing them with the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated about them helps investors better project a stock's price performance.Here is how F5 performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:Revenues- Services: $374.47 million versus the seven-analyst average estimate of $365.66 million.

FFIV shares gained 10.6% during Monday’s extended trading session after the application security solution provider reported better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings and provided impressive guidance for the fourth quarter.This Seattle, WA-based company’s non-GAAP earnings of $3.21 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.86. The bottom line increased 24.9% from the year-ago quarter’s $2.57 per share and was way higher than management’s guided range of $2.78-$2.90 per share. The robust bottom-line performance was mainly driven by higher revenues, the benefits of price realization and easing supply-chain constraints and related costs.F5 revenues of $702.6 million for the third quarter fell short of the consensus mark of $703.2 million. However, on a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 4.2% and came well above the midpoint of management’s guidance range of $690-$710 million despite persistent macroeconomic uncertainties and tight budgets of customers.F5 stated that better sales execution mainly boosted the top-line performance. The company also noted that it is witnessing early signs of stabilization in demand as third-quarter demand remained above what it had expected at the beginning of the quarter. Moreover, though third-quarter demand was way lower than the year-ago quarter level, it remained higher than the first and second quarters of the current fiscal.F5, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseF5, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | F5, Inc. QuoteTop Line in DetailProduct revenues (47% of total revenues), which comprise the Software and Systems sub-divisions, increased 1% year over year to $328.2 million. The rise in Product revenues was mainly driven by increased sales of Systems, partially offset by a decline in Software sales. The company’s reported non-GAAP Product revenues were slightly lower than our estimates of $333.8 million.Systems revenues grew 5% year over year to $155 million, accounting for approximately 47% of the total Product revenues. Though the demand for Systems products remained constrained, the segment benefited from supply-chain normalization and better execution in reducing the backlog. Our estimates for Systems revenues were pegged at $190.1 million.Story continuesIndustry-wide supply-chain constraints for components in 2022 had severely hurt F5’s Systems segment’s overall performance. However, a continuously improving supply chain for the past couple of quarters has been helping the company clear its backlog, thereby boosting its Systems top line.However, the benefits of higher Systems sales were partially offset by weak performance in Software. Software revenues declined 3% year over year to $174 million in the third quarter, mainly due to tough comparisons. Nonetheless, Software sales improved 32% sequentially, reflecting strong growth in renewals. Our estimates for Software’s third-quarter revenues were pegged at $143.7 million.Global Service revenues (53% of the total revenues) grew 8% to $374 million. The robust growth was mainly driven by price increases introduced last year and the benefits of high-maintenance renewals. Our estimates for Global Services revenues were pegged at $362.4 million.F5 Networks registered sales growth across the Americas and EMEA regions, witnessing a year-over-year increase of 3% and 16%, respectively. However, revenues from the APAC region plunged 6% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue contributions from the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions were 57%, 26% and 18%, respectively.Customer-wise, Enterprises, Service providers and Government represented 66%, 13% and 21% of product bookings, respectively.MarginsOn a year-over-year basis, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins contracted 80 basis points (bps) and 70 bps to 79.8% and 82.5%, respectively. However, sequentially, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins expanded 190 bps and 210 bps, respectively. The company noted that the sequential improvement was primarily driven by price realization and ease in supply-chain constraints, as well as reductions in ancillary supply-chain costs.While GAAP operating expenses went up 4.8% to $457.4 million, non-GAAP operating expenses declined 5.7% to $346 million. GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 65.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 from 64.7% in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to 49.2% from 54.4% in the year-ago quarter.F5 Networks’ GAAP operating profit declined 2.8% to $104 million, while the margin contracted 120 bps to 14.7% However, the non-GAAP operating profit jumped 20% year over year to $233 million, while the margin improved 440 bps to 33.2%. An increase in the non-GAAP operating margin was primarily driven by higher revenues and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by a contraction in the gross margin.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash FlowF5 Networks exited the June-ended quarter with cash and short-term investments of $690.6 million compared with the previous quarter’s $755.3 million.The company generated operating cash flow of $165 million in the third quarter and $463.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.During the quarter, FFIV repurchased shares worth $250 million. In the first nine months of fiscal 2023, it bought back common stocks worth $290 million. As of Jul 24, 2023, F5 had $982 million remaining under its current authorized share repurchase program. So far in fiscal 2023, the company has utilized about 68% of its free cash flow toward share buybacks compared with its commitment of using at least 50% of free cash flow for share buybacks announced at the beginning of fiscal 2023.GuidanceF5 Networks projects non-GAAP revenues in the $690-$710 million band (midpoint of $700 million) and non-GAAP earnings per share in the $3.15-$3.27 band (midpoint of $3.21) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The non-GAAP gross margin is forecast to be around 83%.Considering the full-quarter benefits of cost-reduction initiatives announced in April 2023, the company expects fourth-quarter non-GAAP operating expenses between $338 million and $350 million. Share-based compensation expenses are anticipated in the range of $55-$57 million.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderF5 currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

But there’s more to the index than just those aggressive names. In fact, there are even many Nasdaq stocks suitable for people following value investing strategies.The Nasdaq isn’t just a technology index either. There are Nasdaq stocks to buy in industries as diverse as telecom, banks, and financial service companies.The Nasdaq 100 Index has been off to a roaring start in the first half of this year. But fear not; there are still plenty of bargains out there. These are the July 2023 undervalued Nasdaq stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsComcast (CMCSA)Image of the Comcast (CMCSA) logo on the back of a white van in a rural areaSource: Todd A. Merport / Shutterstock.comComcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is a large diversified telecom and media company. The core business is in its cable assets. It also has a large television operation, and it runs theme parks.In some ways, Comcast shares many similarities with The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). However, Comcast has generally done a better job of avoiding social controversies and boycotts, which have helped lead to dramatic underperformance in Disney stock in recent years.Comcast’s greatest strength has been in its internet business. According to Morningstar estimates, Comcast has grown its market share from 50% to 67% for broadband in the markets where it serves. A high-quality internet is a key consumer staple good, and Comcast is locking in attractive long-term cash flows with these market share gains.There is more uncertainty around the media business with the difficult economics that the streaming industry has seen to date. Theme parks could also face a slowdown when consumer spending slows. All told, however, this all appears to be baked into the stock price. Morningstar’s Michael Hodel believes CMCSA shares are worth $60, which puts them at a 30% discount to fair value today.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comStory continuesPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a Fintech firm focused on online payments, money transfers, and e-commerce solutions. Once a spin-off from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), PayPal emerged as a fantastic growth stock in 2020.The end of the stay-at-home e-commerce boom hit PYPL stock hard, however. Shares have plunged from a peak of around $300 to less than $75 today. It’s not hard to see why sentiment has waned. Growth has slowed, competition is rising, and there are long-term concerns about how key assets such as Venmo will be monetized.At some point, though, enough is enough. After its share price collapse, PYPL stock is now going for just 15 times forward earnings. And analysts see those earnings continuing to grow at a double-digit annualized rate through at least the year 2025. While PayPal’s growth trajectory has slowed, the stock price has dramatically overreacted, setting up a value investment opportunity.JD.com (JD)JD stock, Jd.com, Tiger Global is a major investor in JDSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is one of China’s large e-commerce sites. It rose to prominence with a focus on authentic, high-quality goods, which has proven to be a key selling point in that market.In more recent years, JD has been an innovator. It leads the way in logistics investments in the Chinese market, including its pioneering drone delivery program. It has also gone into other fields, such as healthcare.The Chinese internet and technology stocks have taken a huge hit in recent years as the economy has been slow to recover from the COVID-19 lockdowns. With JD stock down more than 35% over the past year, however, it has reached deep bargain territory. Shares go for less than 13 times forward earnings today.Ericsson (ERIC)a picture of cell towers during daytimeSource: ShutterstockEricsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) is a leading provider of telecom equipment used to build and operate mobile networks. The firm plays a large role in the roll-out of new and improved infrastructure, such as 5G networks.ERIC stock plunged recently following its weak second-quarter earnings results. The company announced a surprise loss in the face of weak demand and lower profit margins. It offered a similarly downbeat outlook for the third quarter while noting that it expects business to pick up strongly in Q4.It’s no secret that telecom companies have been in a down part of their spending cycle recently, and the recent results shouldn’t come as a big surprise. Despite that, ERIC stock is now down more than 25% over the past year. This creates a bargain opportunity as analysts expect the company to return to strong profitability in 2024, with shares going at just 8 times next year’s projected earnings.Morningstar’s Matthew Dolgin agrees that shares are significantly mispriced. He sees fair value for ERIC stock up at $9, suggesting that the price could nearly double in the coming months once sentiment turns around.Gilead Sciences (GILD)A Gilead Sciences (GILD) sign at the company headquarters in Silicon Valley, California.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comGilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) is a large biotech firm. It soared to prominence around a decade ago as it rolled out a cure for Hepatitis C. Shares surged from $20 to $120.However, revenues quickly plateaued as a cure rather than a treatment for an ongoing illness, and investors lost interest in GILD stock. Shares have fluctuated between $60 and $80 for the better part of the past decade.But that may be about to change. Gilead’s revenues have increased in recent years, rising from $22 billion in 2018 to $27 billion last year. That came in part due to remdesivir, which is used to manage symptoms related to COVID-19 infections. That revenue stream remains strong; in fact, the FDA just approved remdesivir for treating viral COVID-19 in folks with renal disease, including those on dialysis, making it the only option for those patients.GILD stock currently trades for just 11 times forward earnings, and analysts see the company returning to earnings growth in 2024. Meanwhile, shares yield almost 4%.Roper Technologies (ROP)software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecuritySource: ShutterstockRoper Technologies (NASDAQ:ROP) is a conglomerate software company. It is a serial acquirer, having purchased dozens of different smaller companies over the years and assembling them into an empire.Roper began as an industrial conglomerate. Over time, however, it has divested lower-margin physical manufacturing businesses while increasing its investments in software. Its solutions today serve industries as diverse as K-12 school management, power plants, graphic design, and insurance brokering.What makes Roper fascinating today is that the company just moved its listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq earlier in July. This will make ROP stock eligible to be added to the Nasdaq 100 stock index at its next rebalance. This should cause passive ETFs, such as Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ), to buy up Roper shares and push the stock significantly higher.Nasdaq (NDAQ)Source: ShutterstockRounding out this list, what better way to own Nasdaq stocks than investing in the Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ) exchange itself? That’s right, Nasdaq is a publicly-traded company in its own right.And it’s been quite a successful one, too. Shares are up roughly 900% since the company’s 2002 IPO. Over time, Nasdaq’s profits rise as the exchange attracts more listings and capital. There are a bunch of ancillary revenue streams as well, such as data sales, software and services, advisory, and so on.Recently, Nasdaq stock sold off following its announcement of a large deal to buy a software firm that provides solutions to wealth management firms. While the valuation is a bit steep on the deal, Nasdaq is understandably broadening out its business and becoming a full-service provider to the investment and trading industries. With the recent sell-off, NDAQ stock now goes for less than 19 times forward earnings.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in GILD, ROP, and NDAQ stock.

358,2bdf8ab3-5ea2-390b-9207-c8d7f50755c7,DVN,2023-07-26,"Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) delivers shareholders enviable 83% CAGR over 3 years, surging 5.5% in the last week alone",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-nyse-dvn-delivers-120033098.html,1690372833,STORY,['DVN'],"[Generally speaking, investors are inspired to be stock pickers by the potential to find the big winners. But when you hold the right stock for the right time period, the rewards can be truly huge. Take, for example, the Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) share price, which skyrocketed 393% over three years. It's also up 12% in about a month. But the price may well have benefitted from a buoyant market, since stocks have gained 5.9% in the last thirty days.On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Devon Energy became profitable within the last three years. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Devon Energy the TSR over the last 3 years was 508%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Devon Energy had a tough year, with a total loss of 3.2% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 14%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 10%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Devon Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Devon Energy   (of which 2 are potentially serious!) you should know about.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

359,1d24d6da-43d3-3020-bafc-0afdc21ca1ee,DVN,2023-07-26,Earnings Preview: Devon Energy (DVN) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-devon-energy-dvn-140131441.html,1690293691,STORY,['DVN'],"[Devon Energy (DVN) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil and gas exploration company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -49.4%.Revenues are expected to be $3.94 billion, down 30% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.29% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Devon Energy?For Devon Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -10.64%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Devon Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Devon Energy would post earnings of $1.39 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.46, delivering a surprise of +5.04%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Devon Energy doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They Just Have Nowhere to GoAsia’s Richest Families Fuel Race for Lucrative Finance JobsBurning Ship’s Operator Says Almost 500 EVs Are on BoardChina Stops Short of Direct Consumer Support to Spur EconomyArab States Sour on Israel in Blow to US Aim of Saudi Peace PactThe South Korean supplier to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. now expects sales of its high-end DRAM chips to more than double this year to power storage-hungry AI applications. SK Hynix said it’s gearing up to push out more of those chips, even as the company vowed to continue to slash overall output.The chipmaker’s sales came to 7.31 trillion won ($5.7 billion) in the June quarter, roughly half its revenue a year ago but soundly beating an average projection for 6.05 trillion won. Its operating loss came to 2.88 trillion won, in line with expectations.“The worst has passed,” said Baik Gil-hyun, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea.Shares in SK Hynix pared gains and were down around 1.5% Wednesday, amid a broader selloff on the Kospi and with weakness in the overall memory market tempering optimism.Samsung Electronics Co., SK Hynix and Micron Technology Inc. have struggled for the better part of two years with a post-Covid collapse in demand for the memory chips essential to smartphones, servers and computers. This month, larger rival Samsung recorded its worst decline in quarterly sales in more than a decade, while sector bellwether Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. cut its outlook and postponed production at its Arizona project to 2025, underscoring the depth of a global electronics market slump that set in after consumers and corporations trimmed spending to deal with a downturn.SK Hynix shares recouped some of their losses since 2021 this year, gaining about 51% through Tuesday’s close on bets that output cuts and greater economic certainty might lift industry prices. Analysts including JP Morgan’s JJ Park also cited the rollout of new high-bandwidth memory that works in tandem with AI hardware such as Nvidia graphics accelerators, which promise to speed up data processing for intensive tasks such as training AI.Story continues“We are seeing increasing adoption of AI by major customers, and that makes us believe that a turnaround for memory is very near,” Sanjeev Rana, head of Korea Research at CLSA told Bloomberg TV.SK Hynix will continue to invest to expand the production capacity of high-density DDR5 and HBM3 chips, Chief Financial Officer Kim Woohyun said. Sales for graphics DRAM including HBM chips accounted for about 20% of quarterly DRAM sales, and the company will focus on increasing mass production of HBM chips next year.But overall demand for memory remains weak, SK Hynix warned. The company is sticking to its target to reduce capex by at least 50% compared to 2022 and said production for both DRAM and NAND will be lower this year.The world’s No. 2 memory maker indicated recovery in its traditional sales drivers would be muted, although it said the effects of production cuts will materialize in the second half. SK Hynix said it expects overall server market demand to remain soft, with only a “subdued” recovery in mobile demand. NAND shipments will remain flat in the current quarter, it said.Expectations of a recovery in the second half buoyed optimism about an end to an unprecedented slump that’s gripped the $160 billion global memory industry, which has been sitting on months’ worth of inventory. This year, Samsung and its peers cut output to try and stabilize memory prices.Read more: Samsung Sales Fall Most in Over a Decade as Chip Slump PersistsIt remains unclear when the industry — infamous for its boom and bust cycles — will climb out of its sales trough. Much may depend on a fundamental Chinese economic rebound, which remains uneven.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysSK Hynix’s strong sequential sales growth for its high-performance DRAMs for artificial-intelligence (AI) servers in 2Q — demand more than doubled sequentially for high-end DRAMs — could imply it will be a major beneficiary of generative AI. Although DRAMs’ contribution to operating profit is still small, they could generate a larger profit in 2024 due to better production yields.- Masahiro Wakasugi, BI analystClick here for the full researchLonger term, the US-China conflict over technology and semiconductors further weighs on industry outlook.Beijing launched a security review of chips from Micron this year, spurring concerns the government there is taking a more aggressive stance toward foreign companies. The country is among Korea’s largest export destinations, and both a key market as well as a production base for companies from Samsung to SK Hynix.Both South Korean memory makers currently operate in China under a one-year waiver on equipment imports.SK Hynix is looking into various options regarding its China operations, weighing long-term geographic risks, market demand and efficiency and talking with relevant government officials and chip gear makers, CFO Kim said.How US and Allies Are Trying to Rein In China Tech: QuickTake--With assistance from Youkyung Lee, Edwin Chan and Vlad Savov.(Updates with executive comments from earnings call)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekInfluencers Built Up This Wellness Startup—Until They Started Getting SickAI in Hollywood Has Gone From Contract Sticking Point to Existential CrisisThe Stainless-Steel Boom Is Tearing a South African Mining Region ApartThe Sorry State of Search Is an Ominous Sign for the AI EraProperty Owners Ignore Climate Risk Amid Insurance Meltdown©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

370,a30ce5a0-23d5-3c5b-9be4-de4f3d26437c,HAS,2023-07-26,Thanks Barbie! 3 Toy Stocks Worth Playing as Dolls Make a Comeback.,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thanks-barbie-3-toy-stocks-194034002.html,1689795634,STORY,"['MAT', 'HAS', 'BBW', 'FNKO']","[Thanks to the much-anticipated release of the film “Barbie,” top toy stocks – in particular Barbie creator Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) – have enjoyed significant interest. For MAT stock, it bounced up nearly 17% since the start of the year. Most of the green ink arrived within the trailing month, where shares returned over 15% of equity value.Of course, for those seeking stock market comeback plays, Mattel appears quite compelling. In the trailing one-year period, MAT remains down almost 8%. Therefore, it’s possible that shares may continue driving higher. At the same time, it’s also possible that Mattel has already benefitted from the buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news effect. If so, those investing in toy industry opportunities may want to consider other ideas.Indeed, now might be an ideal time to consider consumer discretionary stocks in general. At this juncture, data regarding inflation demonstrates an encouraging (as in declining) trend while consumers are still opening their wallets. Over time, Federal Reserve policy may clamp down hard on inflation. But until that time, these toy stocks may offer lucrative upside.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsToy Stocks: Hasbro (HAS)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7A global play and entertainment company, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) represents an icon among top toy stocks. In addition to the underlying industry, Hasbro offers several consumer products as well as television, movies, digital gaming, music and virtual reality experiences, per its corporate profile. Since the beginning of this year, HAS gained a hair over 2%.Admittedly, it’s not the most exciting idea. However, Hasbro might be more interesting for those specifically investing in toy industry opportunities because of its Star Wars licensing deal. As you know, the science-fiction franchise represents an economy onto itself. Plus, it offers organic gender-neutral offerings. On the other hand, Mattel’s Barbie is for girls. I don’t mean that pejoratively – I’m just pointing out the reality.Story continuesInterestingly, HAS trades at a forward earnings multiple of 14.12, which is undervalued. In contrast, MAT trades at a forward multiple of 18.2, which is near fair value. Thus, Hasbro makes a better candidate for stock market comeback plays. Finally, analysts peg HAS as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $73.22, implying nearly 16% upside potential.Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comWhile Build-A-Bear Workshop (NYSE:BBW) might not immediately have the name-brand recognition of high-profile toy stocks, it’s awfully compelling because of its unique (as far as I’m aware) business model and attractive financial metrics. Per its public profile, Build-A-Bear specializes in interactive retail experiences, particularly in the creation of customizable stuffed animals. Since the start of the year, BBW fell nearly 8%. However, in the trailing year, it’s up over 35%.Those banking on consumer discretionary stocks may find great value with Build-A-Bear. Currently, the company prints a three-year revenue growth rate on a per-share basis of 10.2%. This stat ranks better than 69.23% of its peers. As well, its EBITDA growth rate clocks during the same period at 67.7%.Still, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of only 6.53. As a discount to projected earnings, BBW rates superior to 93.36% of the competition. Lastly, Small Cap Consumer Research’s Eric Beder believes BBW will hit $41 per share. If so, that implies over 81% upside potential.Funko (FNKO)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comEasily the riskiest idea among toy stocks on this list, Funko (NASDAQ:FNKO) is a leading pop culture consumer products company. Per its corporate profile, Funko designs, sources and distributes licensed pop culture products across multiple categories, including vinyl figures, action toys, board games, plush, apparel, housewares and accessories for consumers who seek tangible ways to connect with their favorite pop culture brands and characters.If you want to know the truth, I thought Funko was for little kids and adult nerds. However, the brand features surprising reach. It’s just that Wall Street doesn’t quite care at the moment. Since the Jan. opener, FNKO slipped 28%. In the trailing one-year period, shares gave up 67% of equity value.Unfortunately, the company suffers from a high debt load, fiscal instability and negative trailing-year operating and net margins. However, it does print a respectable three-year revenue growth rate of 7.1%. That’s better than nearly 72% of its peers. Analyst consensus pegs FNKO as a hold. However, the average price target happens to land at $14.67, implying over 88% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

A larger investment asset base, higher reinvestment rate and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds and real estate among others coupled with an improving rate environment are expected to have aided net investment income. Net investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line.Story continuesLife insurers have been redesigning products, focusing on protection products. Increasing awareness and demand for protection products are likely to have driven sales. Life insurers continue to roll out investment products that provide bundled covers of guaranteed retirement income, life and healthcare to cater to customers preferring policies with “living” benefits more than those with death benefits.The second quarter of 2023 bore the brunt of June storms. JP Morgan estimates insured losses in the second quarter to be about $10 billion as per a report published in Reinsurance News. Nonetheless, better pricing, reinsurance arrangements, portfolio repositioning, reinsurance covers, favorable reserve development and prudent underwriting are likely to drive an improvement in underwriting results.The players continue to make investments in digitalization, which, in turn, is likely to have saved costs and driven margin expansion. Riding on the strength of a solid capital position, insurers engaged in strategic buyouts and mergers, built on a niche, expanded globally, diversified their portfolio and deployed capital to make dividend hikes and pay special dividends. Share buybacks are expected to have provided an additional upside to the bottom line.Potential Q2 OutperformersArch Capital Group offers insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance across the world. Premiums in the second quarter are expected to have benefited from growth in most lines of business, primarily related to rate increases, new business opportunities and gains in existing accounts in the Insurance and the Reinsurance segments. ACGL is expected to have gained from better pricing and increased exposure, which are likely to have aided underwriting profitabilityThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ACGL’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.65, suggesting an increase of 23.1% from the year-ago reported figure.

The estimate is indicative of a 7.2% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported earnings of $2.63 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.2 billion, suggesting a rise of 5.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.AON’s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 1.6%. This is depicted in the graph below.Aon plc Price and EPS SurpriseAon plc Price and EPS SurpriseAon plc price-eps-surprise | Aon plc QuoteWhat the Quantitative Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts a likely earnings beat for AON this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is precisely the case here.Earnings ESP: AON has an Earnings ESP of +2.56%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at $2.90 per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.82. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AON currently has a Zacks Rank #3.Before we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at AON’s previous-quarter performance first.Q1 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, the leading global professional services company’s adjusted earnings per share of $5.17 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.3%, primarily due to increased operating expenses. However, the negatives were partially offset by strong retention, business generation, growth in core P&amp;C, and solid performance in Commercial Risk Solutions’ Latin America, EMEA and Pacific region operations.Story continuesNow, let us see how things have shaped up prior to the second-quarter earnings announcement.Factors Driving Q2 PerformanceCommercial Risk Solutions’ performance in the second quarter is likely to have gained from new business generation, robust retention and management of the renewal book portfolio. Increased travel-related spending, global exposure and pricing are likely to have benefited its performance in the quarter under review.Our estimate for the Commercial Risk Solutions line’s revenues indicates 3% growth from $1,692 million a year ago. The unit’s performance is likely to have been boosted by solid growth in Latin America, EMEA and Pacific regions. Also, its core P&amp;C operations are likely to have improved in the quarter under review.Our estimate for the Health Solutions line’s second-quarter revenues suggests 5% growth from the year-ago level. Growth in core health and benefits brokerage is likely to have aided the segment. Also, improvement in human capital is likely to have boosted the unit’s results in the second quarter.Our estimate for Reinsurance Solutions’ revenues indicates a 12% jump from a year ago. It is likely to have witnessed growth in the to-be-reported quarter on the back of consistent new business generation and strong retention. Improvement in Strategy and Technology Group is likely to have benefited the unit in the second quarter.We expect Wealth Solution’s revenues in the second quarter to have increased 1% from the year-ago period. Increased advisory demand, project-related work and retirement growth are likely to have aided the unit in the quarter under review.All the factors stated above are likely to have positioned the company for overall year-over-year growth and an earnings beat. However, escalating expenses due to substantial investments in the priority areas for long-term growth and an increase in certain discretionary and other expenses are likely to have partially offset the upside.Our model suggests that information technology related costs are likely to have increased nearly 10% in the second quarter, while other general costs are expected to have climbed almost 5% year over year.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies worth considering from the broader finance space, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:American Equity Investment Life Holding Company AEL has an Earnings ESP of +1.70% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update information contained in this release, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, and notwithstanding any historical practice of doing so.A copy of this release is available at www.roberthalf.com/investor-center.ATTACHED: Summary of OperationsSupplemental Financial InformationNon-GAAP Financial Measures ROBERT HALF INC.SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS(in thousands, except per share amounts)Three Months EndedJune 30,Six Months EndedJune 30,2023202220232022(Unaudited)(Unaudited)Service revenues$  1,639,478$  1,862,827$  3,355,813$  3,677,661Costs of services979,3091,047,2802,005,9122,090,268Gross margin660,169815,5471,349,9011,587,393Selling, general and administrative expenses541,904509,3941,094,1331,023,588(Income) loss from investments held in employee deferred compensation trusts(28,347)65,622(55,638)95,623Amortization of intangible assets7214161,442833Interest income, net(5,320)(718)(10,145)(884)Income before income taxes151,211240,833320,109468,233Provision for income taxes44,91965,01291,812124,173Net income$    106,292$    175,821$    228,297$    344,060Diluted net income per share$          1.00$          1.60$          2.14$          3.12Shares:Basic106,102108,833106,260109,025Diluted106,422109,696106,775110,143 ROBERT HALF INC.SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION(in thousands)Three Months Ended June 30,Six Months Ended June 30,2023202220232022(Unaudited)(Unaudited)SERVICE REVENUES INFORMATIONContract talent solutionsFinance and accounting$    721,391$    810,910$ 1,499,224$ 1,612,600Administrative and customer support211,023274,141430,373559,047Technology181,776218,190375,858431,517Elimination of intersegment revenues (1)(114,807)(137,548)(240,598)(281,748)Total contract talent solutions999,3831,165,6932,064,8572,321,416Permanent placement talent solutions149,254200,096305,991386,878Protiviti490,841497,038984,965969,367Total service revenues$ 1,639,478$ 1,862,827$ 3,355,813$ 3,677,661(1)Service revenues for finance and accounting, administrative and customer support, and technology include intersegment revenues, which represent revenues from services provided to the Company's Protiviti segment in connection with the Company's blended business solutions.

(the ""Company"") are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP"") and the rules of the SEC. To help readers understand the Company's financial performance, the Company supplements its GAAP financial results with the following non-GAAP measures: adjusted gross margin; adjusted selling, general and administrative expense; combined segment income; and as adjusted revenue growth rates.The following measures: adjusted gross margin and adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses include gains and losses on investments held to fund the Company's obligations under employee deferred compensation plans. The Company provides these measures because they are used by management to review its operational results.Combined segment income is income before income taxes, adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets. The Company provides combined segment income because it is how management evaluates performance.As adjusted revenue growth rates represent year-over-year revenue growth rates after removing the impacts on reported revenues from the changes in the number of billing days and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company provides this data because it focuses on the Company's revenue growth rates attributable to operating activities and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time. The impacts from the changes in billing days and foreign currency exchange rates are calculated as follows:Billing days impact is calculated by dividing each comparative period's reported revenues by the number of billing days for that period to arrive at a per billing day amount. Same billing day growth rates are then calculated based on the per billing day amounts. Management calculates a global, weighted-average number of billing days for each reporting period based upon inputs from all countries and all functional specializations and segments.Foreign currency impact is calculated by retranslating current period international revenues, using foreign currency exchange rates from the prior year's comparable period.The non-GAAP financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company's industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to amounts presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided on the following pages.ROBERT HALF INC.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESADJUSTED GROSS MARGIN (UNAUDITED):(in thousands)Three Months Ended June 30,RelationshipsSix Months Ended June 30,RelationshipsAs ReportedAs AdjustedAs ReportedAs AdjustedAs ReportedAs AdjustedAs ReportedAs Adjusted2023202220232022202320222023202220232022202320222023202220232022Gross MarginContract talent solutions$   398,636$   464,853$   398,636$   464,85339.9 %39.9 %39.9 %39.9 %$     822,261$     926,714$     822,261$     926,71439.8 %39.9 %39.8 %39.9 %Permanent placement talent      solutions148,975199,664148,975199,66499.8 %99.8 %99.8 %99.8 %305,370386,113305,370386,11399.8 %99.8 %99.8 %99.8 %Total talent solutions547,611664,517547,611664,51747.7 %48.7 %47.7 %48.7 %1,127,6311,312,8271,127,6311,312,82747.6 %48.5 %47.6 %48.5 %Protiviti112,558151,030117,882139,61722.9 %30.4 %24.0 %28.1 %222,270274,566232,366259,30722.6 %28.3 %23.6 %26.8 %Total$   660,169$   815,547$   665,493$   804,13440.3 %43.8 %40.6 %43.2 %$  1,349,901$  1,587,393$  1,359,997$  1,572,13440.2 %43.2 %40.5 %42.7 %The following tables provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP adjusted gross margin to reported gross margin for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:Three Months Ended June 30, 2023Three Months Ended June 30, 2022Contract talentsolutionsPermanent placement talent solutionsTotal talent solutionsProtivitiTotalContract talentsolutionsPermanent placement talent solutionsTotal talent solutionsProtivitiTotal$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of RevenueGross MarginAs Reported$  398,63639.9 %$  148,97599.8 %$     547,61147.7 %$   112,55822.9 %$     660,16940.3 %$  464,85339.9 %$  199,66499.8 %$     664,51748.7 %$ 151,03030.4 %$   815,54743.8 %Adjustments (1)——————5,3241.1 %5,3240.3 %——————(11,413)(2.3 %)(11,413)(0.6 %)As Adjusted$  398,63639.9 %$  148,97599.8 %$     547,61147.7 %$   117,88224.0 %$     665,49340.6 %$  464,85339.9 %$  199,66499.8 %$     664,51748.7 %$ 139,61728.1 %$   804,13443.2 %The following tables provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP adjusted gross margin to reported gross margin for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:Six Months Ended June 30, 2023Six Months Ended June 30, 2022Contract talentsolutionsPermanent placement talent solutionsTotal talent solutionsProtivitiTotalContract talentsolutionsPermanent placement talent solutionsTotal talent solutionsProtivitiTotal$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of RevenueGross MarginAs Reported$  822,26139.8 %$  305,37099.8 %$   1,127,63147.6 %$ 222,27022.6 %$   1,349,90140.2 %$  926,71439.9 %$  386,11399.8 %$   1,312,82748.5 %$ 274,56628.3 %$   1,587,39343.2 %Adjustments (1)——————10,0961.0 %10,0960.3 %——————(15,259)(1.5 %)(15,259)(0.5 %)As Adjusted$  822,26139.8 %$  305,37099.8 %$   1,127,63147.6 %$ 232,36623.6 %$   1,359,99740.5 %$  926,71439.9 %$  386,11399.8 %$   1,312,82748.5 %$ 259,30726.8 %$   1,572,13442.7 %(1)Changes in the Company's employee deferred compensation plan obligations related to Protiviti operations are included in costs of services, while the related investment (income) loss is presented separately.

Management calculates the billing day impact by dividing each comparative period's reported revenues by the number of billing days for that period to arrive at a per billing day amount. Same billing day growth rates are then calculated based on the per billing day amounts.

Harrie Schippers, Brice Poplawski, Ken Hastings, and I will update you on our second quarter financial results and business highlights. I'll start by saying thank you to PACCAR's great employees who continue to deliver excellent results and provide our customers with the best trucks and transportation solutions in the world. PACCAR achieved record revenues and net income in the second quarter due to its excellent portfolio of new trucks, robust aftermarket parts business, healthy financial services performance and continued strong market demand. PACCAR's revenues increased 24% to $8.9 billion. Net income increased 70% to $1.22 billion. PACCAR Parts second quarter revenues increased by more than 11% to $1.6 billion. Parts pretax profits were $419 million 19% higher than the second quarter of last year. Truck, Parts and Other gross margins were excellent in the second quarter at 18.8%, up from 14.4% in the same period last year.PACCAR is delivering structurally higher margins as a result of our investments in the industry-leading new range of premium trucks our sophisticated and successful aftermarket parts business and as a result of our overall global growth. PACCAR's innovative research and development programs and partnerships provide our customers with the right products and technology to help them optimize their operations.During the second quarter, we are pleased to announce the expansion of our strategic partnership with Toyota to develop and bring to market zero emissions hydrogen fuel cell-powered Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks. PACCAR powertrain portfolio of hydrogen fuel cell, hydrogen combustion, battery electric and clean diesel technologies position the company and our customers for an excellent future.PACCAR Financial also had an excellent quarter, achieving profits of $145 million due to its high-quality portfolio and positive used truck results.Looking at the truck market. Industry build has been gradually increasing this year. And in the U.S. and Canada, we estimate the Class 8 market to be in the range of 290,000 to 320,000 trucks. The 2023 European truck market is expected to be in a range of 300,000 to 330,000 units. We project the South American above 16-tonne truck market to be in a range of 105,000 to 115,000 vehicles this year. South America is an important region for PACCAR's geographic growth. DAF Brasil has done an excellent job growing market share since we opened the business 10 years ago, achieving a record 9.2% share in the first 6 months of this year. As we look forward to the rest of this year, and 2024, the truck markets are expected to remain healthy and PACCAR will continue to deliver excellent performance.Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR Financial Services and other business highlights.Harrie C. A. M. SchippersThanks, Preston. PACCAR delivered 51,900 trucks during the second quarter. Supply chain is improving, though occasional supplier shortages still limit production. We estimate third quarter deliveries to be in the range of 48,000 to 52,000 trucks. The third quarter delivery estimate reflects the normal summer shutdown in Europe. PACCAR achieved strong truck parts and other gross margins of 18.8% in the second quarter. We estimate third quarter gross margins to be in the 18% to 19% range, reflecting continued high-level performance of PACCAR's Truck and Parts business.PACCAR Parts achieved strong second quarter gross margins of 31.6%. The Parts business continued its track record of high sales and profit growth, with quarterly sales growing by 11% and profits by 19% compared to the same period last year. PACCAR Parts is focused on expanding its customer base, and providing a full range of technology-enabled transportation solutions is driving its excellent results. In the last 5 years, annual part sales have grown by 73%, and Parts profits have increased by 136%. The consistent performance of parts as a high-growth, high-margin business is structurally beneficial to PACCAR. Third quarter Parts sales are expected to increase 6% to 8% compared to the same period last year. PACCAR Parts' growth is supported by a network of 18 distribution centers, more than 2,000 dealer locations and 250 independent ERP stores, as well as technologies like managed dealer inventory and innovative e-commerce systems. PACCAR Parts continues to expand and will open a new distribution center in Massbach, Germany next year. Each new distribution center increases the number of dealers and customers benefiting from receiving parts on the same or next day.PACCAR Financial Services' second quarter pretax income was a solid $145 million. The Financial Services business benefited from excellent portfolio quality and good used truck results. Used truck prices have moderated, but are historically strong. With its larger portfolio and superb credit quality, PACCAR Financial is having another very good year. PACCAR has invested $7.5 billion in new and expanded facilities innovative products and new technologies during the past decade. These investments have created the newest and most impressive lineup of trucks in the industry and will contribute to excellent performance for many years. PACCAR's after tax return on invested capital improved to an industry-leading 35% in the first half of the year, up from 22% in the same period last year. Capital expenditures are projected to be $625 million to $675 million this year, and research and development expenses are estimated to be $400 million to $430 million.PACCAR's industry-leading truck lineup, highly efficient manufacturing operations, best-in-class Parts and Financial Services businesses and the continued development of advanced technologies position the company well for today and for the future. Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies.Stephen Edward VolkmannPreston, since you brought it up, I'm curious if you might be willing to provide any additional thoughts on 2024 being a robust year. Do you guys have orders for '24? And how much visibility and how much confidence do you have that 2024 can be a robust year?R. Preston FeightWell, Steve, it's good to talk to you. Thanks for the question. I'd start by saying being full for 2023 right now is a great place to be operating from. The markets continue to be healthy for us around the world, and what we see is that we have great conversations going on with our customers, and so we're having great conversations around what the trucks are going to be and their order needs are going to be for next year. There are some sectors out there that are exceptionally good. That's LTL, vocational and otherwise, and demand is expected to be strong.Stephen Edward VolkmannOkay. Maybe I'll pivot again on '24. But if '24 were to be a down year in any amount, you talked about sort of structurally higher margins, I'm curious how you guys think the decremental margins would look if there was a decrement.R. Preston FeightWell, Steve, you know we don't provide 2024 guidance on this call. I think you do hit up on a really good point, though, which is the structural improvements of PACCAR compared to a few years ago are significant, right? The product investments we've made; industry-leading trucks we have in Europe that are significantly outperforming; the growth we have in South America, which is significant; the new medium-duty products in North America; and the fact that PACCAR Parts is doing such a great job with being a high-margin, high-growth, technology-driven transportation solutions provider for our customers, all of those things contribute to a great future.OperatorOur next question is from Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan.Tami ZakariaSo my first question is, since your order books are full for this year, like you said, you probably have visibility into fourth quarter deliveries as well. So should the fourth quarter deliveries be sequentially better than the third quarter or possibly the highest delivery quarter of the year? Or how should we think about 4Q versus 3Q?R. Preston FeightYes. What I would think about is the second half, Tami, and the second half being a strong second half with the full backlog. You have some differences in the markets in Q3 and Q4 and Q3 in Europe has summer shutdowns. So that affects things. In North America in Q4, there's more holidays as well. But in general, we will be trying to increase build. We still continue to look at the market as being somewhat constrained in terms of supply base. That periodically affects us and everyone else, and so that may have a pacing item on the deliveries in Q4.Tami ZakariaGot it. And then can you comment on what was the price realization for trucks and parts in the second quarter? And do you expect price realization to sequentially decline in the back half?R. Preston FeightI'll let Harrie kind of talk about that one.Harrie C. A. M. SchippersPricing for trucks in the second quarter was up 15%. We saw significant cost increases still in the order of magnitude of 9% for trucks. And then for parts, cost increases were a little higher, but more than offset by price increases for parts of around 13%.Tami ZakariaAny comments on the back half pricing outlook?Harrie C. A. M. SchippersNo, with all the new products and the structural improvements that Preston just explained, I think we're in a good position to maintain our pricing discipline.R. Preston FeightI think Harrie shared that we expect margins of 18% to 19% in Q3, and I think that's kind of a testament of how we see the price cost analysis's going.OperatorOur next question is from Chad Dillard from Bernstein.Charles Albert Edward DillardAs you look -- as you think about price cost over the next 12 months and also contemplate the pullback we've seen in raw material costs, do you think the market is strong enough for you to actually increase that price cost spread? Or do you think you'll need to give some back to understand how you're thinking about managing that balance?R. Preston FeightI guess we don't spend as much time thinking about it in those terms. We continue to think about it in terms of the relationships we have with our customers, the strength of the product performance and the value that provides to the customer. Like as we've shared before, the new trucks are providing at least 7% improvement in fuel economy, which is bringing thousands and thousands of dollars of benefit to our customers, the trucks that these drivers want. And so I think our customers make a good decision around trying to buy the best product for their operations, which are PACCAR's products, and that gives us a good pricing position as a premium brand in the market.Cost. Well, cost is something that you get to follow as much as us, and we look at the world around us and see some movement in costs in positive ways and still labor pressures on the other side of it. So it's a little bit ambiguous.Charles Albert Edward DillardGot it. Okay. And just second question. So there are some industry forecasts are calling for something on the order of like a 15% cut of production in the coming year, and I'm certainly not holding it to that. But how should we think about your ability to grow your Parts business in such an environment?R. Preston FeightI think the Parts business is growing for several reasons. One is it's because our ability to get parts to our customers in the same day or next day has changed a lot. So we are the desired place to go for parts for people. I think the application of technology by our team has been an enabler as well, like we make sure that our dealers have the right parts that they need and support. And I think that understanding our customers' needs is how we think about it. So parts is really a transportation solutions provider, which makes them the go-to source for customers. And we think we're the leader in that space, and that helps us grow the business through all parts of the coming years.OperatorOur next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research.Robert Cameron WertheimerJust a mechanical question on how you typically open orders for the year forward. Are you still holding back at all just on containing other uncertainty? And then a real market-based question on vocational trucks, whether you expect or have already seen some of the strength that may come with the infrastructure bill or general construction appearing there and whether there are any constraints on that market growth from body building or other capacity issues?R. Preston FeightYes. So the first question on how we think about the order book, we have close relationships with our customers, and those relationships carry on all the time. So some customers want to place orders already and want multiyear orders, and we deal with those customers on a case-by-case basis. We try not to get ahead of ourselves in general pricing release before we understand what the world is going to look like a little bit in 2024. So the next quarter or so, that will start to free up. In terms of the vocational market, think about that, it is exceptionally strong right now. There is a limitation on -- from the bodybuilder standpoint. They're trying to build as many bodies as they can. We're building as many vocational trucks as we can, and we think we're at the beginning of that. So we think that, that will continue for quite some time as investments into America are continuing.OperatorOur next question today comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI.David Michael RasoThe Parts business, the third quarter, the up 7% midpoint, I'm just trying to get a sense of the volume baked in. The first quarter, right, pricing was up 15% in Parts. You had a little bit of currency drag, so volumes were up a little. The second quarter, given that price comment, I'm not sure volume was up at all in Parts. The third quarter, I'm just giving you a sense of the volume. Are the volumes assumed down in the third quarter year-over-year and then you have the price to get back to 7% total?Harrie C. A. M. SchippersSo the 6% to 8% growth in the third quarter, what you have to take into account, David, is that last year, we saw very strong growth in Parts, especially in the third quarter. And with this 6% to 8% growth, we expect the year to be 10% to 13% higher than last year, which is excellent and above our long-term average.David Michael RasoOkay. So that implies the fourth quarter is up only similar to the third. But again, I know it's tough comp, just so I kind of understand the volume/price issue. Is the slowdown mostly volume going a bit negative? Or is there something about the pricing? I'm just trying to understand that cadence between volume and price so I can better understand how to model the margins.Harrie C. A. M. SchippersI wouldn't call it a slowdown that, David. I think the parts business is growing 6% to 8% in the quarter, 10% to 13% for the year. That's an excellent performance by the entire PACCAR Parts team.David Michael RasoYes, I'm not refuting. I'm just trying to get a sense of the volume versus price that you're thinking about the rest of the year. That's all. In the up 7%, is that all price? Or is it volume down and price up to more than negate the volume decline? I'm just trying to get that split.Harrie C. A. M. SchippersSure. Of course, it's a combination of volume and price.R. Preston FeightYes. If you're trying to get it in the macro, David, maybe you could look at it and say like there was a lot of pent-up pressure for parts and getting inventories right into people's businesses, dealerships, customers. I think some of that has been met on the parts side of the business, not on the truck side really. And now that's kind of the flow that we're looking at going forward.David Michael RasoThat's fair. Okay. So you're just sort of normalizing the parts after heavy last year kind of stocking. And then by the end of the year, you're hopefully balance here on the parts? Is that sort of the idea?R. Preston FeightI guess we say it differently. And as Harrie said, I think aptly that you see the growth being steady growth over the full year. with just a 6% to 8% third quarter in it. And then growth again next year. So the business is doing tremendously well.David Michael RasoOkay. And one follow-up. On the order books for '24, are we looking to do that a quarter or 6 months at a time like we've done recently? Or more return to a more traditional open up for the full year?R. Preston FeightI think what we'll do is we'll look at the first part of the year and decide what the first part of the year looks like and release like that as we get into the general pricing.OperatorOur next question is from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse.Jamie Lyn CookI guess just 2 questions. One, I know you're full on production for 2023, and that's limited to some degree by supply chain constraints still. Can you talk to sort of where delivery for the year or in the back half, if supply chain was back to more normalized levels? I'm wondering potentially, is that a tailwind to 2024? I mean if markets -- if supply chain gets back to normal share because we've underserved the market?And then my second question, can you just give -- I know you had some nice market share gains in South America. Could you just give a broad view on what your market share is relative to the order book if it's improved and sort of what markets potentially next year? And down -- assuming the downturn happened, where would be the biggest opportunity for PACCAR to gain market share?R. Preston FeightSo the first part of your question, Jamie, good talking with you, is really around -- I do think that the supply constraints continue at some modest level, and that modest level does provide a tailwind to the market in 2024. I agree with you. I think on the second side of your question, I don't know. Maybe Harrie has thoughts on it or something like that. But...Harrie C. A. M. SchippersWell, I think market share, we've been building as many trucks in the first half of this year as we can around the world, and so market share is a result of that. And yes, we've seen strong market share growth in South America. We expect further growth opportunities there. Market shares in North America and Europe have had a slow start of the year. But as we progress during the year, we expect growth opportunities across the world.R. Preston FeightYes. To add into it, I would say like our build percentage is increasing. And as our build percentage increases, which has been supply-constrained, then our market share grows. And we see nothing but strong demand for the products. So it's really just about being to associate that demand, and that's just going to take us some time to get the build out.OperatorOur next question today is from Steven Fisher from UBS.Steven FisherSo within your 18% to 19% Q3 gross margin forecast, can you just help us with some of the underlying factors there? I assume the European shutdown will be a headwind. So does that mean kind of mix of parts versus trucks is a tailwind that offsets that? Or the mix from new models is still a tailwind? What -- or are there other factors to consider? Maybe you could just help us with a little bit of buildup of how that kind of stays in that range.R. Preston FeightI think it's pretty steady performance between parts and trucks in Q3 from Q2, which I think kind of lays into what we're seeing in the market, which is a strong market with strong performance. And that's happening on the truck and parts side, and we see that continuing.Harrie C. A. M. SchippersI would echo that. If I look at the third quarter, it's probably just a continuation of what we've seen in the second quarter.Steven FisherOkay. That's helpful. And then you had in the release about the expansion of Chillicothe. I guess in terms of capacity needs, how are you planning for 2025 and 2026. There's some talk about this being sort of a record North American up cycle. How are you thinking about that? And how do you think the rest of the supply chain is preparing for this? Are there going to be kind of capacity strength if this demand cycle plays out with that prebuy as people are thinking?R. Preston FeightYes. I would say that what we're doing in Chillicothe is what we do all the time, which is making investments into our facilities to increase capacity and efficiencies. It's just a good example of it in Chillicothe, and that 105,000 square foot building expansion we did there just helps us get more product out and even increases the level of high quality to a next level-up. From a build-out standpoint, that's just what we do. Like I said, we're doing it there. We're making investments in Columbus. We're making investments in Mexico. Really all around the world in South America. So we see the growth of PACCAR in the long term, and so we want to make sure that we're prepared for that with the factories.From a supply base standpoint, we have great suppliers. We work closely with them to make sure that they have the capacity Obviously, they've had unusual circumstances in the past couple of years. I'd expect some normalization there, and we'll continue to work closely with them to make sure that they can provide the product we need.OperatorOur next question today comes from Tim Thein from Citigroup.Timothy W. TheinPreston, it's just, I guess, yet another one on the parts business, and I think this will be a North American focus. But I'm just curious if you listen to some of the public truckload companies that have reported. I mean they've seen some pretty -- a lot of pressure just in terms of utilization and pressure on profitability. I'm just curious, a lot of the discussion was just on positive messaging that you're kind of conveying. But any warning signs that you're seeing or hearing from either your large fleet customers or your dealers in terms of sometimes when you get pressure on profitability, you may get some maintenance intervals that get pushed out or rebuild? Did that get extended or what have you? I'm just curious if there's been any sign of that. Or is it just they're chugging right through that and it's -- the business is not feeling that? I'm just curious what's kind of real time what you're hearing from the team specific to your truckload customers.R. Preston FeightGreat question. Good to think about it in that broad term. I think from a truckload carrier standpoint, you heard their comments in their earnings calls, as have we, and in our relationships with them, and they've come through. I think a tough few months for them in terms of utilization and rates, but they also kind of will say that there may be a seed the bottom of it, and things are starting to show signs of improvement in that truckload carrier. But that's not the whole market. We also see the LTL market continuing to be strong, and we see the vocational market continuing to be strong, as well as medium duty. So from a total business standpoint, we see this steady, strong position that we're in, and we expect that to continue. And then that may even be aided as the truckload carriers see improvement in their businesses in the coming quarters.Timothy W. TheinGot it. Okay. And that makes sense. And then just within your truck order board within the backlog, is there -- historically, PACCAR, again, more North American-oriented question. But pretty well balanced, certainly at least against some of your OEM peers across small-, mid-, large-sized fleets. Is the order board and kind of the how the deliveries have played out, are you seeing more -- has that shifted more towards your big large fleets or, I guess, your large fleet this year? And what do you think about the investment appetite for your small to midsized carriers as you think about '24?R. Preston FeightI think of it -- I think it's more representative of the first way you kind of came at the market through the vocational and truckload and over-the-road carriers versus vocational rather than the small, mid, large. I think that there's variance within that small, mid, large sector.OperatorOur next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank.Nicole Sheree DeBlaseMaybe just starting with your 3Q delivery outlook, down at the midpoint a little bit Q-on-Q. Is that 100% driven by European holidays, so you're effectively projecting U.S. production flat to up in the third quarter?Harrie C. A. M. SchippersThat is correct, Nicole. And Europe has a 3-week summer shutdown every year. It takes 3 weeks of production out. And some of that is offset by higher production in all the parts of the world.Nicole Sheree DeBlaseOkay. Okay. Understood. And then in the spirit of the expanded relationship with Toyota on the hydrogen fuel cell side, can you just talk a little bit about the level of customer demand that you're actually hearing for hydrogen fuel cell trucks at this point?R. Preston FeightYes. That's -- it's a great question. It's one that the customers are trying to understand the choices out in front of them, right? With the regulations coming, they'd like to know whether they're going to be using clean diesel, whether hydrogen infrastructure is going to develop, whether they can use hydrogen combustion, hydrogen fuel cells or battery electric. It seems like it will be some combination of both for a while or some -- all of the above for a while. And so I think there is quite a bit of an interest on behalf of Peterbilt and Kenworth and the Toyota fuel cell project, and we've got strong inquiries and orders for that already. And I would expect people will explore that. Obviously, they're trying to balance this total cost of ownership for all the different technologies, and it's early days, and I think that they're trying to learn right now more than they're trying to convert.OperatorOur next question is from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.Jerry David RevichPreston, I wonder if I could ask, your profit per truck now stands at $18,000 in prior cycles. It hasn't gotten above $10,000. Can you just talk about what's driven that acceleration? Because you've always had the premium brand in the market, it feels like you're getting a higher return on the incremental fuel efficiency improvements in automation. I'm wondering if you could just maybe help us understand how much of that improvement is those areas versus improved competitive discipline and how are you thinking about opportunities from here on the next set of product development platforms that you folks have set up on the road map.R. Preston FeightSure. Thanks for the question. I do think that what the investments we've made over the past several years are paying off. and they're paying off in a bunch of different markets. So they're paying off in the fact that within DAF in Europe, we have the only truck that complies with mass and dimensions is fully compliant with that. It provides great aerodynamic benefit, great driver benefit we're able to sell it at a higher price and provide better profitability for ourselves because the customers get a benefit in that fuel economy. Similarly, at Kenworth and Peterbilt, the new T680 and 579 are doing a great job of providing the industry's leading fuel economy for our customers. And then the new medium-duty products that we launched give us a different level of profitability in the medium-duty space and customer benefits as well. So all of those things kind of are taking our profitability to a structurally-improved level. And South America, I should add, is also a business growth area for us where that's contributing. So we see that these are sustainable, long-term advantages.And then to the second part of your question about future. Well, we couldn't be more excited than we are about the investments we have going forward. There's a whole suite of things that we're working on right now that I think will just continue to set the standard in terms of premium trucks and transportation solutions.Jerry David RevichSuper. And then from an SG&amp;A standpoint, any one-off pieces in the quarter? Really interesting to see SG&amp;A down as much as it was sequentially and flat year-over-year given the top line growth, how should we be thinking about the SG&amp;A leverage off of this 2Q base?Harrie C. A. M. SchippersWe continue to control our SG&amp;A expenses very tightly. That's how we run the business. So we've seen some increases here and there, but it's offset by being more efficient elsewhere and, a very controlled SG&amp;A spending level going forward is what you're going to expect from us.Jerry David RevichAnd then just last one. In the prepared remarks, you spoke about the new facilities improving, dealer on-time deliveries and ability to stock. Where do dealer inventories of your A runners stand today versus a year ago? Is it fair to assume service levels are up versus a year ago and inventories are up at your dealers' level for the high-volume runners.R. Preston FeightYes, I think that that's -- it's a fair observation that a year ago, things were pretty tight and constrained in terms of parts inventory, and that's been maybe ameliorated to some percentage. So that's helping people get their service done in a more quick way. which is good for our customers, which is what we're always out for.Harrie C. A. M. SchippersAnd parts inventories have gone up, of course, as we sell more. Net-net, inventory turns were at record levels in the second quarter. So continue to have the inventory that we need to satisfy our customers.R. Preston FeightAnd it's helped us as we grow our overall share of the Parts business.OperatorOur next question is from Matt Elkott from Cowen &amp; Co.Matthew Youssef ElkottJust a quick follow-up on Europe. You guys obviously have a technology advantage over the last few quarters there. But is the outlook in Europe primarily driven by technology? Because the European economy does face some challenges broadly, and that's being reflected in freight at times, at least on the intermodal side -- on the revenue intermodal side.R. Preston FeightI think what you're saying is that you can imagine the European economy has maybe -- has felt like the mouth kilometers are down a little bit year-over-year, and we recognize that. But we do think that the new truck is performing so well that that's to our advantage in Europe.Matthew Youssef ElkottOkay. And then follow -- another follow-up on the hydrogen side with Toyota fuel cell. You guys have been somewhat of the opinion that hydrogen, ICE engines could be one of the most viable bridges to whatever technology we coalesce around long term. Do you still think that? Or is the Toyota fuel cell partnership, does it market that change?R. Preston FeightNo, I think that we do still think it can be a solution. I think that it depends upon regulatory allowance. Like in Europe, hydrogen ICE is allowed as a zero emissions product. That's not determined yet in the North American space. It has to be still discussed with the agencies. Again, we think that there is efficiencies of fuel cells and different efficiencies with hydrogen ICE and different ones for battery electric. So I think it's important that we explore and work through all of those and see what are up with the best total cost of ownership is for our customers because that's really what we're driving for. And that's the level of the conversation right now. And we think it's a bit early to make a call on which one is going to be right. We do think that diesel engines will be a significant part of that for the years to come.Matthew Youssef ElkottGot it. And then just one final clarification. I know supply chain disruptions have eased generally in recent quarters. But is there a way to gauge how far we still are from pre-COVID levels? And if you guys see a line of sight into getting back to those levels next year.R. Preston FeightI don't know if there's a way to gauge it. I would say the suppliers are doing a pretty good job of trying to work through it as quickly as they can and trying to increase their capacity and meet the -- satisfy the market. Nobody wants to do it more than them or us. And so together, we're working through that. And I keep seeing this improvement. It's far better than it was a couple of quarters ago, and we expect it will be better in the quarters to come.OperatorOur next question is from Jeff Kauffman from Vertical Research Partners.Jeffrey Asher KauffmanJust wanted to get -- already on one item, and then I want to go back to the Zero emission vehicles and a follow-up there. For PACCAR Financial, it looks like the fleet was up about 2%, but assets were up about 6% versus first quarter. Could you help me understand that differential?Harrie C. A. M. SchippersThe average sales prices of trucks have gone up quite a bit over the last couple of years. We said earlier during the call, in the second quarter, pricing was at 15%. So even with 2% growth in the total fleet for PACCAR Financial, the total assets grow with the higher prices per truck as well, of course.Jeffrey Asher KauffmanAll right. And secondly, talking about the new emission vehicles, I had a chance to see the new truck at ACT Expo. And I was asking, ""Well, are people putting in orders? And when would you deliver the market?"" And I was told, ""Oh, yes, you can put it in order today, but we're probably looking at a 2025-ish timeframe."" And I just want to kind of follow up on that. The electric vehicle push was aggressive. It feels like some folks are pulling back over challenge the charging infrastructure and what have you. You answered the earlier question what are you seeing on fuel cell. But can you give us an idea of when that truck is likely to be available? And maybe kind of update what's going on with customers on the battery electric side?R. Preston FeightWell, sure, happy to do that. So 2024 is when we think we'll be putting fuel cell trucks out there with the Toyota project. So that's -- we've already done 11 of them in the market. That was our first fleets that we did last year, and now we're kind of just finishing up what will be a higher volume run. We expect that to be in the hundreds still. It's kind of what I would expect on the fuel cell level.Your comments on people pulling back or not, we see still strong interest on EV, battery electric EV, but there is an infrastructure thing that needs to be worked through as a society. What our position is, is PACCAR will have the best products, whether they're battery electric, diesel, hydrogen fuel cell, hygiene combustion. We'll have that entire suite available, and then we'll be ready for the market. So we work closely with the regulatory agencies to support them and work with our customers to support them and puts us in a great position for the future. We could not be more excited about the kinds of technologies and what that does for PACCAR's future and how we'll perform.OperatorOur next question is from Michael Feniger from Bank of America..Michael J. FenigerPreston, are you seeing anything in the truck market in terms of the way freight moves or your customers' purchasing patterns that maybe suggest a normal traditional replacement cycle? It's higher than what we've observed historically. Are fleet operators trying to keep a younger fleet? Or any other trends that maybe what we normally think is replacement demand if the market returns there it's actually higher given some changes in the freight and the transportation market?R. Preston FeightYou're right. I do think it will be higher than maybe people used to think of it. But more importantly to me is the fact that the trucks that are being produced, specifically by PACCAR are providing operating cost advantages, which helps people want to renew their fleet at a sooner level. If you get a 7% benefit in fuel economy from a new Peterbilt or Kenworth or a DAF in Europe, the value is so high that you just want to replace the truck, plus the driver satisfaction is higher, and it's just a good business decision. So I think we see those turns happening more frequently.Michael J. FenigerHelpful. And you mentioned earlier in the call how used truck values have moderated, yet still high on a historical basis. Do you find the spread between new truck pricing and your used truck pricing wider than normal? Or is the moderation in used truck values more of just a normalization of production? Curious how you're kind of seeing that used values playing out in the second half of this year.Harrie C. A. M. SchippersTalk about normalization of used truck prices. If we compare back to a year ago, used truck prices were extremely high and probably not even healthy for the market. I think in the meantime, used truck prices have come down to very normal levels. And our company, it's the finance company that sells the used trucks. And we've built out a network of 13 used truck centers that help us to sell more used trucks to retail customers at a premium price. So even at a slightly moderated used truck pricing levels, the finance company continues to do well and is able to sell the used trucks that we get back at profit levels.Operator(Operator Instructions) We have no further questions. I would like to hand back for any closing remarks.Ken HastingsWe'd like to thank everyone for joining the call, and thank you, operator.OperatorThank you, everyone, for joining today's call.

(Photo: Peterbilt)Paccar charged 15% more for a new truck than a year ago, a driving force behind a surge in second-quarter profits.But inflation-driven pricing is only part of the story of a record 70% increase in Q2 profitability.The Bellevue, Washington-based parent of Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF Trucks charged customers substantially more for new equipment than the roughly 9% increase it paid to build a truck.“We expect [gross profit] margins of 18-19% in Q3. That’s a testament of how we see the price/cost analysis going,” CEO Preston Feight told analysts on the company’s earnings call Tuesday.Paccar sold out of build slots for 2023Paccar is seeing strong demand for its trucks, almost all of which have been revamped in recent years to boost fuel economy. Plants are essentially out of build slots for the rest of this year. Unlike some industry predictions, Paccar sees a robust 2024.“Being full for 2023 right now is a great place to be operating from,” Feight said. “The markets continue to be healthy for us around the world. We’re having great conversations around what the needs are going to be and the order needs are going to be for next year.”Paccar estimates Class 8 industry retail sales in the U.S. and Canada to be in a range of 290,000-320,000 trucks this year.Growth markets: LTL and vocational trucksGrowth markets include less-than-truckload and vocational models, which are benefiting from federal infrastructure money being distributed to states.“There is a limitation from the body builders’ standpoint,” Feight said. “They’re trying to build as many bodies as they can. We’re trying to build as many trucks as we can. We think that will continue for quite some time.”Controlling sales, general and administrative expenses was another factor in the strong performance.“All of these things are taking our profitability to a structurally improved level,” Feight said.Paccar invested in its business, including $47 million for a new 105,000-square-foot testing facility at its Kenworth assembly plant in Chillicothe, Ohio. The company has invested $7.5 billion in products and facilities in the past decade, CFO and President Harrie Schippers said.Story continuesA technology-enabled Paccar Parts footprint expandsParts sold for 13% more than a year ago. That’s the same margin Paccar expects for the full year, a combination of volume and higher prices. Paccar operates 18 parts distribution centers  globally covering 3.3 million square feet. A 19th center opens in Germany in 2024.“Our ability to get parts to our customers in the same day or next has changed a lot,” Feight said. “So we are the desired place to go for parts.”Pent-up demand for parts has been mostly met as supply chain disruptions have eased in recent quarters. The same cannot be said on the truck side. Modest supply constraints should push some orders into 2024.Paccar build percentage growing but market share off to tough start in 1st halfThe company pointed to a 9.2% market share in South America, a market Paccar entered a decade ago. It did not reveal North American or European market share figures.“Our build percentage is increasing. And as our build percentage increases, then our market share grows,” Feight said. “We’ve seen nothing but strong demand for the products, so it’s really about being able to satiate that demand.”There is evidence that fleets are replacing their fleets faster than previously, especially after being forced to hold on to vehicles beyond traditional trade cycles during the pandemic.“The trucks being produced, specifically by Paccar, are providing operating cost improvements that make people want to renew their fleet sooner,” Feight said. “The value is so high that you just want to replace the truck. So we see those turns happening more frequently.”Paccar shares closed down 2.69% at $86.31 Tuesday, paring a deeper intraday decline.   Shares have retreated since closing at a record $89.42 last Tuesday.

Rowe Price Group, Inc. TROW is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results before the opening bell on Jul 28. TROW’s quarterly revenues are expected to have witnessed a year-over-year improvement while its earnings are likely to have declined.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, net revenues declined because of a fall in assets under management (AUM) and investment advisory fees.T. Rowe Price’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and lagged once, the average negative surprise being 3.24%.T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseT. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseT. Rowe Price Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. QuoteT. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseTROW’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter won analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings of $1.71 per share has moved 1% upward over the past seven days. However, the figure indicates a decline of 4.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the metric is $1.67.The consensus estimate for revenues of $1.58 billion indicates 4.3% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate is $1.55 billion.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q2The performance of asset managers in the second quarter is expected to have been supported by favorable equity markets. In fact, S&amp;P 500 Index increased 8.3% sequentially in the quarter, indicating impressive market performance.However, challenges in investment management industry accompanied by an economic slowdown are likely to affect results in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, fixed-income markets saw negative performances during the quarter.Amid the challenging operating environment, T. Rowe Price is likely to have continued to record net outflows in the second quarter. Per the company’s monthly metrics data, it recorded net outflows of $20 billion in the quarter under review.Story continuesDespite this, as of Jun 30, 2023, TROW’s preliminary AUM balance of $1.4 trillion indicates a rise of 4.2% from the March-end figure.Given growth in AUM, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for investment advisory fees of $1.43 billion suggests an increase of 2.4% from the previous quarter’s reported figure. Our projection for the same is $1.44 billion.Also, the consensus estimate for administrative, distribution and servicing fees of $136 million implies a climb of 5.4% sequentially. Our estimate for the metric is $138 million.Coming to expenses, T. Rowe Price is expected to have incurred higher employee compensation costs due to rising salaries on account of inflation. The company’s initiatives to attract investment advisory clients and additional investments from its existing clients are expected to have led to significant expenditure. Thus, overall expenses are expected to have risen in the quarter under review, impeding bottom-line growth. Our estimate for operating expenses (GAAP basis) is $1.07 billion.Key Development During the QuarterIn April, T. Rowe Price completed the acquisition of Retiree, Inc., a fintech firm providing innovative retirement income planning software.TROW offers leading capabilities in multi-asset investing, portfolio construction and glide path strategies across different life stages. Hence, Retiree's retirement income planning software is expected to complement and expand T. Rowe Price’s existing retirement capabilities, enabling a comprehensive suite of retirement income solutions for investors and practitioner tools for financial professionals.What the Zacks Model UnveilsAccording to our proven model, chances of T. Rowe Price beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are high.

The company's workers have until Aug. 22 to vote on the tentative deal.While the delivery firm has managed to avert a strike, analysts expect the contract would raise overall labor inflation, pressuring the outlook for the year and also weighing on margins at a time when the industry is reeling from waning demand.""Considering a backdrop of meaningful inflation, we believe UPS will need to deliver on pricing gains and productivity to provide visibility to margin performance looking forward,"" UBS analyst Thomas Wadewitz said.Rival FedEx has been slashing costs to protect profits amid waning demand.BMO analyst Fadi Chamoun added that the real question is whether the industry's competitive backdrop supports sufficient pricing power to enable UPS to sustain or improve upon its current operating margins.Meanwhile, other unions cheered the outcome. Commenting on the deal, the president of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union said, ""The Teamsters also put an end to tiers. Equal pay for equal work has to apply everywhere, whether you work at Big Brown or the Big Three.""UAW, which kicked off contract talks with the Detroit Three automakers earlier this month, is also pushing them to eliminate the two-tier wage system under which new hires earn as much as 25% less than veterans.(Reporting by Aishwarya Nair and Priyamvada C in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Shailesh Kuber)]"

It marked a slowdown from a 4% increase in May.After hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, inflation has slowed for 12 straight months.Consumer inflation has fallen to its lowest annual rate in over two years.

But the extraordinary pandemic push on prices from shortages and shift to stay-at-home purchases is clearly over, and the Fed for the first time has the upper hand in its inflation fight,"" pointed out MUFG's chief economist, Chris Rupkey.So is corporate America seeing the same narrative around inflation as Mr. Market is rallying behind?Here's what four top execs who control companies with more than $400 billion in market value just told Yahoo Finance Live about the state of inflation.Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo CFOMarket Cap: $263 billion""The fact that commodities have moderated, they're still inflationary. And I suspect even as we go into next year, commodities will still be inflationary. And with that, prices will still increase.

We'll see how the balance of the year plays its way out.""James Peters, Whirlpool CFOMarket Cap: $8 billion""From a material cost perspective, we saw the peak late last year. If we look at our costs, our logistics costs have come down. Labor is one cost where I would say inflation has steadied. It's at a more typical rate. Obviously, I don't think labor costs will come back down. We saw a $300 million to $400 million deflation in materials costs. I do believe at least for our business, inflation has peaked.""Story continuesLeon Topalian, Nucor CEOMarket Cap: $43 billion""I would tell you that we're a margin business. And so, at the end of the day, we're not immune to some of the influxes of the supplies and services [inflation].

So we did not have the exposure to other nations and other countries like some manufacturing sectors did.""So I think by and large, that's [inflation] tamed and certainly, again, part of our mix as we predict and estimate for the rest of the year.

The agency has been warning banks of the dangers of relying too heavily on fintech partnerships. Credit: Bloomberg NewsWASHINGTON — The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has hit American Express National Bank with a $15 million civil money penalty for violations related to its oversight of one of its third-party affiliates.The OCC said Tuesday that the bank did not ensure that its affiliate — which, according to American Express, refers to its Travel Related Services Company — implemented adequate call-monitoring controls and mechanisms for tracking customer complaints. The OCC also said American Express insufficiently collected and housed essential consumer data and records required to be in its customer identification program, a component of banks' anti-money-laundering compliance mandates.""In the period 2015 to 2017, as part of large-scale efforts to retain small-business customers … the bank violated CIP regulations and recklessly engaged in unsafe or unsound practices,"" according to the OCC release.As noted in its consent order to Amex, the OCC has supervisory authority over the national bank, and while it's been nearly a decade since the bank received an OCC consent order, Amex has faced fines for failing to manage third-party risks and for AML noncompliance in the past. The OCC noted in the consent order accompanying the release that the latest violations were part of a ""pattern of misconduct"" at the firm.American Express told American Banker that as of the OCC's announcement, it had fully addressed and remediated the agency's concerns, including by providing customers redress.""American Express will pay a $15 million civil money penalty to the OCC. We had fully reserved for the penalty in a prior period,"" they wrote in an email. ""The matters covered by the settlement have been fully addressed, including updating card sales policies, enhancing training for sales employees, and providing customer remediation as appropriate.""In 2012, the OCC announced a $500,000 civil money penalty and $6 million in restitution to customers for Amex's failure to properly manage vendors that violated section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by using deceptive collection practices. The OCC also fined Amex $3 million a year later in 2013 for unfair billing and deceptive marketing practices.Story continuesTuesday's announcement comes just over a month after regulators issued updated guidance instructing banks to carefully monitor the risks they face from relationships with third party entities. In the guidance, regulators instructed banks to implement risk management commensurate with their size and complexity, as well as risk profile.The lead author of the revamped third-party guidance, acting Comptroller Michael J. Hsu, has repeatedly warned banks that the increasing prevalence of third-party partnerships, like those between banks and fintechs, could pose new compliance risks. The guidance makes clear that while offloading a banks' internal functions to third parties may increase efficiency, it does not absolve them of accountability and can expose firms to penalties if they fail to monitor their affiliates.""It is important for a banking organization to understand how the arrangement with a third party, including a fintech company, is structured so that the banking organization may assess the types and levels of risks posed,"" the guidance states.]"

In order to accommodate customer’s preferred payment methods, retailers must pay merchant credit card processing fees of anywhere from 1.5% to 3.5% on every transaction in store. According to Nerdwallet, American Express charges the highest percentage and Visa charges the lowest.I Work at Costco: Here Are 12 Insider Secrets You Should KnowLearn: How To Get Cash Back on Your Everyday PurchasesThat might not sound like a lot of money, but when you do the math and see that it’s taking between $1.50 to $3.50 on every $100, you see how it adds up. Additionally, most businesses pass part or all of that fee on to their customers, so in the long run you pay more money just by using your credit card.Costco Strikes a DealWarehouse retailer Costco, which aims to offer the lowest prices to its members in all ways possible, has come up with a workaround on the payment processing fee that is designed to save customers money. According to the company website, Costco only accepts Visa credit cards at its warehouse locations and gas stations.But wait, you might be wondering — that’s still a credit card, so surely it still comes with a processing fee? It does, but at a huge discount.Costco’s Best Deals? Employee Reveals 10 Standout Buys for Your MoneyVisa Made Costco an Offer It Couldn’t RefuseVisa charges the lowest processing fee of most well known credit cards, such as MasterCard, Discover and American Express. The credit card company knows a good deal when it sees one, too. For the exclusivity of Costco only taking its credit cards, Visa is giving Costco a significant discount on its processing fees to less than 0.4% — an unbelievably low rate.It’s a win-win, though. Costco gets to keep offering its customers the lowest prices because it doesn’t have to increase them to accommodate these fees. Visa wins by not losing Costco business to competitor credit cards. And you, the customer, benefits the most.Story continuesIt’s Not the First ExclusiveIf an exclusive partnership with a credit card seems unheard of, Costco has actually been doing this from the beginning. Early on, it teamed up with Discover credit cards exclusively, a card that not as many people were likely to have, then switched over to American Express from 1999 to 2017. However, like any business, Costco looks for the best deal. When American Express stopped offering the best possible rate, Visa won out — along with the Visa and Costco customers.Costco Has Its Own VisaIf you don’t have a Visa card, but still want to shop at Costco, never fear — Costco has its own Visa card (by Citibank) that you can sign up for with no added fees beyond Costco’s annual membership. You don’t have to purchase the Costco Visa, but if you don’t already have one, this makes it easy. The Costco Visa also offers additional perks, such as:4% cash back on gas and EV charging stations up to $7,000 per year and 1% thereafter3% cash back on restaurants and eligible travel2% cash back on purchases from Costco and Costco.com1% cash back on all other purchasesNo foreign transaction feesWhat using a Visa means for the customer is that not only do you get the great deals that Costco is known for, you also get the special perks that come with a unique Visa card. And feel free to shop around.Shop for the Best Visa Card With RewardsIf Costco is your go-to, and you have to use a Visa, then you might want to start shopping for a Visa card that has the best perks and rewards.Two that are considered the best are the Wells Fargo Active Cash Visa — which allows users to earn a $200 cash rewards bonus if they spend $500 in the first three months and unlimited 2% cash back on purchases — and the Chase Freedom Unlimited Card, where you can earn 1.5% cash back on everything you buy and 6.5% cash back on travel.Costco Has the Brand Loyalty To Accept Only One CardA lot of retailers don’t have the customer loyalty and massive customer base that Costco does. Costco has 858 warehouses, 590 of those in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, and in 13 other countries as well. This translates to more than 124 million customers who shop at Costco and who are likely to pick up whatever card Costco requires.So, if credit is your preferred way to pay, rest assured that Costco and Visa have you covered — and at a rate that will save you money, too.More From GOBankingRatesI'm a Real Estate Agent: Buy Real Estate in These 5 Countries To Be Rich in 10 YearsI'm a Financial Advisor: Here's How Often You Should Check Your Retirement Account Balance3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement12 Steps To Finding a Business Idea That Will Make You RichThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Costco Only Takes Visa, and This Means Big Savings for Customers]"

This company, which is in the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This seller of granite, limestone, sand and gravel has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 59.26%.For the last reported quarter, Martin Marietta came out with earnings of $2.16 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.99 per share, representing a surprise of 118.18%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $3.03 per share and it actually produced earnings of $3.04 per share, delivering a surprise of 0.33%.For Martin Marietta, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesMartin Marietta currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.41%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on July 27, 2023.With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

ACHC is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 27, after the closing bell. The main focus of the behavioral healthcare facility operator’s earnings release will be on the performance of its sole operating U.S. segment. Growing patient volumes at its healthcare facilities, partly offset by an elevated expense level, are expected to have shaped the unit’s quarterly performance.Also read: (Here's What to Expect From Acadia Healthcare's Q2 Earnings) to find out how the company’s overall second-quarter performance is expected to have been.U.S. OperationsAcadia Healthcare operates acute inpatient psychiatric facilities, specialty treatment facilities, comprehensive treatment centers (CTCs) and residential treatment centers under the U.S. business. Revenues of ACHC are primarily derived from offering high quality behavioral healthcare services at the above-mentioned facilities in return for which they are entitled to payments from state governments for treating Medicaid patients, commercial insurers, the federal government for catering to Medicare customers and, individual patients and clients. It operated 250 behavioral healthcare facilities equipped with around 11,100 beds, scattered across 39 states and Puerto Rico as of Mar 31, 2023.Highlights of U.S. Business in Q1U.S. same-facility admissions grew 8.6% year over year in the first quarter. Revenue per patient day improved 6.4% year over year, while patient days witnessed 6.5% year-over-year growth. However, the average length of stay declined 1.9% year over year.In the overall U.S. facility, both revenue per patient day and patient days advanced 6.9% year over year. Admissions climbed 10.4% year over year. Yet, the average length of stay tumbled 3.2% year over year.Projection Metrics for Q2Revenues of the U.S. business are likely to have benefited on the back of an expanding base at its acute inpatient psychiatric facilities, specialty treatment facilities, CTCs and residential treatment centers in the second quarter. Patient volumes remain the most significant contributor to a healthcare facility operator’s top line. We estimate U.S. same-facility admissions to improve 4.9% year over year in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesAn aging U.S. population and continued incidence of mental health issues among Americans are likely to have sustained the solid demand for services provided by ACHC’s healthcare facilities.Our estimate for revenues from acute inpatient psychiatric facilities is $359.5 million, which indicates 8.1% year-over-year improvement in the second quarter. We anticipate residential treatment centers to bring in revenues of $76.8 million, up 1.8% year over year.Acadia Healthcare remains quite active with expansion endeavors either in the form of adding beds to its existing facilities or teaming up with leading U.S. healthcare organizations to inaugurate facilities. This, in turn, is expected to have fetched higher patient volumes and subsequently, driven top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Improved patient days and higher revenue per patient day are likely to have imparted strength to ACHC’s U.S. operations. We expect U.S. same facility patient days to witness 1.6% year-over-year growth in the second quarter, while our estimate for revenue per patient day on a same-facility basis indicates a 4.7% improvement on a year-over-year basis. Despite promising growth prospects, the company’s U.S. business is likely to have taken a hit in the to-be-reported quarter from the reduced average length of stay. We estimate average length of stay on a same-facility basis to decline 3.2% year over year in the second quarter.The unit is also expected to have grappled with escalating salaries, wages and benefits stemming from an acute staff shortage. The supply costs and, salaries, wages and benefits are likely to have increased 12% and 10.5% year over year, respectively. This is likely to have reduced profit levels in the quarter under discussion, making an earnings beat uncertain.Overall Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Acadia Healthcare’s second-quarter earnings per share is pegged at 83 cents, which implies a decline of 1.2% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $707 million, suggesting 8.4% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Acadia Healthcare’s bottom line beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, matched the mark once and missed the same on the remaining one occasion, the average surprise being 2.33%.Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc.

411,2d130399-d1ab-3846-9c8e-69be4484659d,ZBH,2023-07-26,Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q2 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zimmer-biomet-zbh-expected-beat-140129668.html,1690293689,STORY,"['ZBH', 'BSX']","[Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis orthopedic device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.82 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.Revenues are expected to be $1.83 billion, up 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Zimmer?For Zimmer, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.34%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Zimmer will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Zimmer would post earnings of $1.66 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.89, delivering a surprise of +13.86%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

BIO is set to release second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 3 after the closing bell.The company posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.34 in the last reported quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.09%. Bio-Rad beat earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, the average surprise being 9.21%.Let’s look at how things have shaped up before this announcement.Factors at PlayLife ScienceBio-Rad’s Life Science segment is likely to have witnessed year-over-year currency-neutral core revenue growth in the second quarter, driven by qPCR products, Western loading and digital PCR. During the first quarter months, the demand for the new QX600 Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) system and customer acceptance has been remarkable, which we expect to have significantly benefited BIO’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.On the last earnings call, the company highlighted the expected launch of the ddPCR microsatellite instability kit toward the end of the second quarter. This assay kit includes an automated analysis package and enables clinical researchers to assess microsatellite instability status across multiple cancers. The addition is likely to have expanded Bio-Rad’s oncology assay menu for Droplet Digital PCR, which buoys optimism.Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. QuoteDespite the sales slowdown in the last quarter, the process chromatography franchise is expected to have witnessed growth, backed by the solid and consistent underlying demand for the business. In the first quarter, Bio-Rad experienced softness in smaller biopharma companies and a tough comparison for the process chromatography franchise related to a very large customer order in the first quarter of 2022, which resulted in a year-over-year decline in revenues.Geographically, we anticipate the Life Science segment to have posted core organic revenue growth in the Americas and Europe similar to the first quarter. The overall performance in Russia is likely to have dented the company’s quarterly sales due to the further tightening of sanctions. On the supply-chain front, Bio-Rad is expected to have made progress in reducing the elevated Life Science backlog position throughout the second quarter.Story continuesPer our model, revenues from this segment indicate an improvement of 22.9% year over year to $396.3 million in the second quarter of 2023.Clinical DiagnosticsExcluding COVID-19-related sales, core Clinical Diagnostics sales are expected to have increased in the second quarter compared to the prior-year period.  The year-over-year growth is likely to have been driven by robust demand for diagnostic instruments, primarily within blood typing and diabetes. However, manufacturing constraints are expected to have affected the product supply.Last quarter, Bio-Rad witnessed a strong rebound in the placement of instruments in China, providing a solid foundation for increased reagent pull-through volumes in the coming quarters. We expect this trend to have continued in the second quarter of 2023, benefiting the company’s top line.On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics Group is likely to have delivered increased currency-neutral core revenues in Asia, the Americas and Europe. As the global effects of COVID-19 continue to recede, the fairly robust demand for the company’s clinical systems is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.Our model projects the segment’s revenues for the second quarter to improve 5.7% year over year to $388.8 million.Meanwhile, we expect market and operational challenges to have persisted in the second quarter, resulting Bio-Rad to deliver a lower-than-expected performance. Increased sanctions on sales of certain products to Russia and a growing revenue headwind from biopharma companies relating to funding constraints are likely to have resulted in a slower pace of growth for the Life Science segment.As witnessed in the last quarter, the company’s gross margin is expected to have declined year over year due to the unfavorable product mix, the higher cost of raw materials and the higher-than-anticipated placement of clinical systems at low margins.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bio-Rad’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $687.9 million, suggesting a drop of 0.5% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its second-quarter 2023 EPS of $2.56 indicates a year-over-year decline of 24.3%.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP, has a higher chance of beating estimates, which is not the case here.Earnings ESP: Bio-Rad has an Earnings ESP of +1.17%.

This compares to loss of $0.11 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -8.94%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this oilfield service company would post earnings of $0.91 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.97, delivering a surprise of 6.59%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Weatherford , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, posted revenues of $1.27 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.20%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.06 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Weatherford shares have added about 51.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 18.6%.What's Next for Weatherford?While Weatherford has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Weatherford: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.28 on $1.26 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.78 on $4.99 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Oil and Gas - Field Services is currently in the bottom 14% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, FMC Technologies (FTI), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on July 27.This provider of equipment and services to energy companies is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +700%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.FMC Technologies' revenues are expected to be $1.93 billion, up 12.5% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These stocks, chosen by the legendary investor, have the potential to generate above-average returns.Let’s examine three notable undervalued Warren Buffett stocks, including both high-profile and lesser-known options.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCoca-Cola (KO)ko stock coca cola lifeSource: Coca-ColaDespite being considered a less exciting choice than tech stocks, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has delivered consistent returns with an average of 7.83% over the past decade. This steady growth has the potential to double investments in 10 years, unlike many trendy stocks that have experienced boom and bust cycles. Additionally, Coca-Cola offers a reliable dividend that further enhances overall returns.While Coca-Cola has produced steady profits, perhaps it’s not as fascinating as stocks in technology. Still, the company maintains consistent growth and exceeds historical profit averages — despite inflation concerns. With ventures into the alcoholic beverages sector and strategic acquisitions like Finlandia vodka and ready-to-drink collaborations, Coca-Cola is making a noteworthy presence in the premium spirits market.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comWith its largest shareholder being Berkshire Hathaway, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) possesses a valuable advantage. The investment firm led by Warren Buffet has been consistently increasing its stake in the company since 2019, fueling speculation of a potential takeover following a recent expansion of Berkshire’s position. Buffett denies the speculation.Still, the investment guru controls a quarter of Occidental, and the stock now trades at about $60 per share — a bit more than Buffett paid for it. Investing in Occidental is enticing due to persistent fossil fuel demand, sustained crude oil prices and Europe’s energy crisis. Factors like the war in Ukraine and short-sighted energy policies contribute to the current energy shortage, while drilling restrictions in the U.S. have also driven up prices.Story continuesBeyond the potential ownership changes, OXY has shown impressive growth and profitability. It has consistently delivered double-digit gains across key metrics and successfully diversified its operations, exemplified by the success of OxyChem — its chemicals division. OxyChem achieved a record EBIT of $2.5 billion in 2022, highlighting the strength of OXY’s diverse operations and its potential for further growth.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comThere’s no better way to invest like Warren Buffett than to invest in the company where he holds the vast majority of his wealth.Indeed, Berkshire Hathaway is not typically considered a Warren Buffett stock selection. However, this is an amalgam of all the stocks he owns. Thus, those looking to buy Buffett’s portfolio can do so (with the lower-priced B-class shares) and ride the coattails of this investing genius.Notably, Berkshire has been aggressively buying back its own shares. Buffett authorized the repurchase of Class A and Class B shares totaling $4.4 billion solely in the first quarter. That is significant because the ability to repurchase Berkshire stock was limited until recently.Previously, the stock could only be bought back if it fell to 120% of its book value, making it a challenging threshold. However, starting in 2017, the board allowed repurchases if Buffett and Munger believed the stock was trading below its intrinsic value. With Berkshire holding substantial cash reserves exceeding $25 billion, they have the means to repurchase shares.Berkshire Hathaway, led by Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett, has established itself as a robust conglomerate. With a diverse portfolio that includes railways, insurance companies, aerospace, candies, and desserts, Berkshire Hathaway stands out with its unique combination of holdings. Additionally, its exclusive banking deals and substantial positions in successful companies make the company an attractive option for investors. That’s especially true considering the significant declines seen in other stocks.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald held a long position in KO, BRK-B.

417,2d130399-d1ab-3846-9c8e-69be4484659d,BSX,2023-07-26,Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q2 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zimmer-biomet-zbh-expected-beat-140129668.html,1690293689,STORY,"['ZBH', 'BSX']","[Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis orthopedic device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.82 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.Revenues are expected to be $1.83 billion, up 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Zimmer?For Zimmer, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.34%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Zimmer will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Zimmer would post earnings of $1.66 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.89, delivering a surprise of +13.86%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Zimmer appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerBoston Scientific (BSX), another stock in the Zacks Medical - Products industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.49 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +11.4%.

The business continues to open stores across the US, both standalone and more ‘shop-in-shop’ outlets through its partnership with Target. The ‘Ultamate’ program is one of the best retail loyalty schemes we’ve seen in terms of demand generation. We think the beauty category is relatively recession resilient with increased spend on skincare and longevity, young people spending ever more time photographing and filming themselves. Challenges from e-com disruptors have been largely seen off (consumers prefer to buy in-store with advice and testers) while brand owners (L’Oreal, Estee) have a symbiotic relationship with the retailers and have zero interest in pursuing a ‘Direct to Consumer’ model like, say a luxury or sneaker brand might.”Story continuesCountries With Highest Medical Research SpendingCopyright: bbtreesubmission / 123RF Stock PhotoUlta Beauty, Inc.

The difficult part is being able to hold them for 30 years to allow the miracle of compounding to take effect. Most people don’t have the diamond hands necessary to ride out the inevitable rough patches that every excellent company faces.Financial experts suggest that time in the market rather than market timing creates lasting wealth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe U.S. News and World Report discussed the 10 best-performing stocks of the past 30 years in May. Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) was the number one stock on the list, with a 30-year total return of 213,088%. A $10,000 investment over that time period turned into $21.3 million.Could you retire on $21 million? Probably, with a bit of self-control.But seriously, the 10 names in the U.S. News list are all reasonably familiar to investors. We all had an opportunity to ride along, but most of us weren’t patient enough.For those who think they could be, here are three names to ride from $9,000 to $9 million. Over 30 years, that’s a compound annual growth rate of 25.9%. By comparison, turning $10,000 into $21.3 million is a compound annual growth rate of 29.1% over 30 years.It won’t be easy, but we can all dream. Here are my three picks.Ulta Beauty (ULTA)ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.Source: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.comThe easiest way to find stocks that stand the test of time is to look for quality companies that continue to grow and reinvest their profits into more growth and profits — rinse and repeat. The power of compounding takes care of the rest.I’ve always been a fan of Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA). I saw its beauty business as more accessible to the average person than Sephora and others. I especially liked combining traditional cosmetics retailing with hair salons and other experiential ideas.It also didn’t hurt that Ulta had a talented chief executive officer (CEO) for many years — Mary Dillon, the current CEO of Foot Locker (NYSE:FL), was the big cheese at Ulta between July 2013 and June 2021 — a period when its stock appreciated by more than 250% — and pushed the company to open stores across the country.Story continuesNow run by Dave Kimbell, Dillon’s second in command between December 2019 and his appointment to replace her in June 2021. Before becoming president, Kimbell was the company’s chief marketer for about five years.In the 24 months Kimbell’s been in charge, ULTA stock has gained nearly 37%, almost 4x greater than the S&amp;P 500.I know what you’re thinking: That’s good, but it’s not 26% annually. True; however, I believe the company should revisit international expansion into Canada and elsewhere.It has more than 1,350 stores across the U.S., almost all of them located off-mall, where it can generate an omnichannel experience its customers appreciate and support.Here in Canada, I see Sephora and Lush in the malls. After that, it’s mostly drug stores like Shoppers Drug Mart controlling the market — a case of having the right idea at the wrong time.Fair Isaac (FICO)Hypothetical demo of data analyticsSource: Chart by Josh EnomotoRegarding stock symbols, Fair Isaac (NYSE:FICO) has one of the most recognizable among U.S.-listed stocks. After all, who doesn’t know what a FICO score is?In mid-June, I suggested that investors get out of FICO stock because it was trading at a premium. In the month since, it’s gained about 6%, nearly 200 basis points higher than the index. Over the past five years, it’s up 309% — 5x higher than the index.Overall, I think this is an excellent company with a major emphasis on data analytics. To determine someone’s FICO score, it runs through copious amounts of data to come up with a number. However, it is what businesses can do with the FICO score data that makes Fair Isaac so valuable.FICO was trading within $35 of an all-time high at the time. It’s now around $4 from it and likely to blow through over the summer.In the big picture, artificial intelligence (AI) and financial data were made for each other. Fair Isaac will likely create more products, services and platforms to leverage its experience in credit scoring, etc.While it is expensive relative to your average S&amp;P 500 stock, I’ve concluded that you have to pay more for quality. FICO appears to be one of those stocks you add to your position whenever it has a bit of a correction.A classic example would be during the pandemic years. Its shares corrected by more than 30% on at least two occasions before going on a massive run over the past 10 months.Builders FirstSource (BLDR)Builders FirstSource (BLDR) exterior and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comInvestors need stronger hands regarding housing-related stocks such as Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR). The slightest whiff of recession talk and investors hit the exits.It’s perfectly understandable, which makes it more attractive as a long-term hold because there will be times when no one wants to own its stock; patient investors will pounce on those opportunities, and you can too.In the meantime, BLDR is up 124% in 2023 and 704% over the past five years. If you bought its IPO shares in June 2005 at $16, you’d have a compound annual growth rate of 10.10%.That percentage doesn’t sound great, but it only started scaling in the past few years. In 2004, it had revenue of $2.06 billion and an operating profit of $107.42 million. In 2022, its revenue was $22.73 billion, with $3.77 billion in operating profits. So, its operating margin has gone from 5.2% in 2004 to 16.6% in 2022, a three-fold increase in its margins.The best part about its business is that it focuses on companies like Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and other large builders who need building supplies. Builders FirstSource will have a great business to run as long as there’s a housing shortage.Its best days are ahead.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.85 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.9%.Revenues are expected to be $2.41 billion, up 9.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.09% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Vertex?For Vertex, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.12%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Vertex will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Vertex would post earnings of $2.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.05, delivering a surprise of +3.39%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Vertex doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Leidos would post earnings of $1.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.47, delivering a surprise of -7.55%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Leidos doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, Textron (TXT) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.20 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +20%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.39 billion, up 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Textron has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -4.01%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Textron will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company value investors might notice is Textron (TXT). TXT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 12.77. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 23.10. TXT's Forward P/E has been as high as 17.68 and as low as 11.81, with a median of 14.55, all within the past year.Investors should also note that TXT holds a PEG ratio of 1.14. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. TXT's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.45. Over the past 52 weeks, TXT's PEG has been as high as 1.40 and as low as 0.98, with a median of 1.15.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. TXT has a P/S ratio of 1.06. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.2.Story continuesFinally, our model also underscores that TXT has a P/CF ratio of 11.16. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. TXT's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 39.42. Over the past year, TXT's P/CF has been as high as 12.70 and as low as 10.05, with a median of 11.55.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Textron's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that TXT is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230726744975/en/HighlightsQuarterly PerformanceRevenues: Net revenues grew 6% to $12.0 billion, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 11%. Revenue performance included 10% growth in price/mix and 1% growth in concentrate sales. Concentrate sales were 1 point ahead of unit case volume, largely due to the timing of concentrate shipments.Operating margin: Operating margin was 20.1% versus 20.7% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 31.6% versus 30.7% in the prior year. Operating margin decline was primarily driven by items impacting comparability and currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) expansion was primarily driven by strong topline growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments and higher operating costs versus the prior year, as well as currency headwinds.Story continuesEarnings per share: EPS grew 34% to $0.59, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 11% to $0.78. Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 6-point currency headwind.Market share: The company gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages.Cash flow: Cash flow from operations was $4.6 billion year-to-date, an increase of $83 million versus the prior year, driven by strong business performance and working capital initiatives, partially offset by the transition tax payment made during the second quarter. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $4.0 billion year-to-date, a decline of $45 million versus the prior year.Company UpdatesReinvigorating iconic brands through innovative products, refreshed designs and consumer-centric marketing: Within a vibrant industry, the company continued to grow its consumer base and gain value share for the quarter. At the Cannes Lions festival in June, Trademark Coca-Cola® garnered multiple awards as a result of the company’s recent marketing and innovation transformation. This same approach is being applied throughout the total beverage portfolio. The Minute Maid® brand, which was acquired over 60 years ago as a traditional orange juice, has grown to be the world’s largest juice brand, including regional trademarks such as Cappy® in Europe and Africa and Del Valle® in Latin America. Leveraging the brand’s recognition, the company is delivering new and innovative products that tap into the tastes of younger drinkers such as Minute Maid® Sparkling in China and Minute Maid® Aguas Frescas in North America. Recently, the company launched its first Minute Maid global rebrand with a brighter, refreshed visual identity. The ""Filled with Life"" campaign began rolling out across markets through digitally led experiences that seek to intercept life’s routine moments with a reminder to engage and live life fully. For instance, in Türkiye during long daily commutes, the brand enlivened consumers with unexpected surprises, such as music-based activations. The revitalization further strengthens the brand’s relevance and contributed to Minute Maid generating high single-digit volume growth and overall volume and value share gains for the juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages category for the quarter.Leveraging revenue growth management capabilities, digital platforms and integrated execution to create value for customers and consumers: In an environment where consumer preferences are rapidly evolving, customers are increasingly looking to add value for their shoppers. In North America, the company has delivered on these needs using various strategies such as tailored affordability and premiumization propositions resulting in both volume and value share gains for the quarter. In Vietnam, affordable entry packs led to double-digit basket incidence growth year-to-date, and in Japan, ""Mini Pack, Mini Price"" messaging across categories resulted in double-digit household penetration growth and increased revenue year-to-date. Additionally, the global system continues to invest in digitizing its customer base with B2B platforms which allows for better tailoring of product, price and packaging architecture and ultimately leads to improved revenue growth management. Year-to-date, the system has connected 6.5 million fragmented trade customers to B2B platforms, an increase of 210% versus the prior year.Investing and working as a networked system to pursue sustainability goals: To support the company’s goal to reduce carbon emissions by 25% by 2030, against a 2015 baseline, The Coca-Cola Company and eight leading global bottling partners created a first-of-its-kind sustainability-focused $137.7 million venture capital fund in partnership with Greycroft, a seed-to-growth venture capital firm. The fund aligns with the company’s networked approach to sustainability and has the potential to help advance solutions across its global value chain by investing in sustainability-focused companies at the point of commercialization. Reducing the Coca-Cola system’s carbon footprint is a top priority for the fund, so it will initially prioritize five key areas with the most potential impact: packaging, heating and cooling, facility decarbonization, distribution and supply chain.Operating Review – Three Months Ended June 30, 2023Revenues and VolumePercent ChangeConcentrate Sales1Price/MixCurrency ImpactAcquisitions, Divestitures and Structural Changes, NetReported Net RevenuesOrganic Revenues2Unit Case Volume3Consolidated110(4)(1)6110Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa(5)14(9)009(5)Latin America817(4)021254North America090089(1)Asia Pacific(1)5(5)1042Global Ventures4830010104Bottling Investments510(10)(7)(2)15(1)Operating Income and EPSPercent ChangeReported Operating IncomeItems Impacting ComparabilityCurrency ImpactComparable Currency Neutral Operating Income2Consolidated3(7)(6)15Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa(12)0(11)(2)Latin America18(5)(3)26North America4521025Asia Pacific(11)(3)(6)(2)Global Ventures75(40)(2)118Bottling Investments910(1)1Percent ChangeReported EPSItems Impacting ComparabilityCurrency ImpactComparable Currency Neutral EPS2Consolidated3423(6)17Note: Certain rows may not add due to rounding.1For Bottling Investments, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any.2Organic revenues, comparable currency neutral operating income and comparable currency neutral EPS are non-GAAP financial measures.

The company is not able to reconcile full-year 2023 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2023 projected comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2023 projected comparable cost of goods sold (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported cost of goods sold, full-year 2023 projected underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported effective tax rate, full-year 2023 projected comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported EPS, or full-year 2023 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact timing and exact impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes throughout 2023; the exact impact of changes in commodity costs throughout 2023; the exact timing and exact amount of items impacting comparability throughout 2023; and the exact impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates throughout 2023. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company’s full-year 2023 reported financial results.Full Year 2023The company expects to deliver organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth of 8% to 9%. – UpdatedFor comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 3% to 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 1% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes. – UpdatedThe company expects commodity price inflation to be a mid single-digit percentage headwind on comparable cost of goods sold (non-GAAP) based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions. – No ChangeThe company’s underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) is estimated to be 19.3%. This does not include the impact of ongoing tax litigation with the IRS, if the company were not to prevail. – UpdatedGiven the above considerations, the company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 9% to 11% and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 5% to 6%, versus $2.48 in 2022. – UpdatedComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 4% to 5% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a slight headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes. – UpdatedThe company expects to generate free cash flow (non-GAAP) of approximately $9.5 billion through cash flow from operations of approximately $11.4 billion, less capital expenditures of approximately $1.9 billion. This does not include any potential payments related to ongoing tax litigation with the IRS. – No ChangeThird Quarter 2023 Considerations – NewComparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include an approximate 2% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 1% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include an approximate 3% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.NotesAll references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise noted.All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales, unless otherwise noted. ""Unit case"" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products which are primarily measured in number of transactions. ""Unit case volume"" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers.""Concentrate sales"" represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, ""concentrate sales"" represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by the company to customers or consumers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, ""concentrate sales"" represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments and the Global Ventures operating segment after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.""Price/mix"" represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred.First quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one less day as compared to first quarter 2022, and fourth quarter 2023 financial results will be impacted by one additional day as compared to fourth quarter 2022. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.Conference CallThe company is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss second quarter 2023 operating results today, July 26, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

QuoteThe consensus estimate for net sales is pegged at $2.94 billion, suggesting a 6.8% decrease from the year-ago reported figure of $3.15 billion.Factors to NoteMohawk’s earnings and net sales are expected to have declined in the second quarter, thanks to postponed new home sales and residential remodeling projects. Higher mortgage rates and inflationary pressure have been moderating demand for homes, impacting consumer discretionary spending.Mohawk has been witnessing material, labor and transportation challenges, thereby inflating costs. It expects industry volume and pricing to remain under pressure across the markets served, which are likely to weigh on the to-be-reported quarter’s results.The commercial sector remains stronger than residential, but higher interest rates and tighter lending conditions are expected to impact the business to some extent.MHK expects second-quarter adjusted earnings (excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges) in the range of $2.56-$2.66 per share. Our model suggests the same to decline by 41.2% year over year to $2.59 per share.We expect Global Ceramic’s net sales to fall by 7.7%. Flooring NA net sales are likely to decline by 7.6% and Flooring ROW is expected to be down 13% year over year.Our expectation for adjusted operating income for the Global Ceramic, Flooring NA and Flooring ROW businesses suggests a decline of 22.6%, 37.6% and 23.9%, respectively, from the year-ago period.Nonetheless, the company expects a seasonal improvement in demand and reduced energy and material costs.

Quarterly adjusted earnings and net sales for the quarter, however, decreased 84% and 39.6%, respectively.Weyerhaeuser’s earnings beat the consensus mark in all the last four quarters, with the average surprise being 28.7%.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings has remained unchanged at 21 cents per share over the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates a decrease of 80.2% from the year-ago level. The consensus mark for revenues is $2.03 billion, suggesting a 31.8% year-over-year decline.Factors to NoteSlow construction activities are expected to have weighed on Weyerhaeuser’s second-quarter 2023 results on a year-over-year basis. Precisely, a slow housing market and weakness in the Wood Products segment are likely to have depressed the company’s quarterly results on a year-over-year basis.Overall, lower lumber and OSB prices are expected to have weighed on Weyerhaeuser’s second-quarter 2023 performance despite operational excellence improvements and disciplined capital allocation moves of the company. Meanwhile, the company is expected to have registered sequentially higher sales given the improving housing market conditions.Meanwhile, transportation and resin shortages have been a headwind for the Wood business. Higher raw material costs for OSB web stock, resin and veneer may have also been a pressing concern.During first-quarter 2023 earnings call, WY highlighted that it expects the Wood Products segment’s earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be moderately higher sequentially for the second quarter of 2023 (excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board or OSB). WY anticipates sales volumes to be comparable, with slightly lower fiber costs and moderately higher unit manufacturing costs for OSB. Sales volumes are likely to be significantly higher, and raw material costs are projected to be moderately low for most engineered wood products, partially offset by slightly lower sales.Our model predicts Wood Products segment revenues (which accounted for approximately 70% of first-quarter 2023 revenues) to decrease 37.6% year over year but increase 10.9% sequentially to $1,461.2 million in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to decline 80.6% but increase 19.4% sequentially to $176.8 million from a year ago.Weyerhaeuser expects earnings (before special items) and adjusted EBITDA in the Timberland segment to be $20 million low sequentially. In the West, it anticipates moderately lower sales realizations, partially offset by significantly low per-unit log and haul costs as well as slightly high fee harvest volumes. In the South, sales realizations and per-unit log and haul costs are likely to be slightly low, while fee harvest volumes are projected to be comparable. Forestry and road costs in the South and North are expected to be seasonally higher.We expect the Timberland segment net sales (which accounted for 32.1% of first-quarter net sales) to drop 9.6% year over year but grow 0.4% sequentially to $606.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to decline 23.3% from a year ago and 10.7% sequentially to $167.9 million. Meanwhile, in the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment, Weyerhaeuser expects earnings to be sequentially comparable. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be $20 million, which is lower than the first quarter, thanks to the timing and mix of sales.Our model predicts the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment (which accounted for 5.4% of first-quarter net sales) net sales to be $105.6 million, down 9.7% year over year but up 4.6% sequentially.

The Company’s automated facilities continue to see strong improvements in product quality, throughput, and labor costs, which is mitigating some of the recent commodity price pressures on earnings.Operating EBITDA in the Company’s renewable energy business declined by $22 million compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by decreases in the value of renewable fuel standard credits and lower energy prices.Free Cash Flow &amp; Capital AllocationThree Months EndedJune 30,(in millions)20232022Net cash provided by operating activities$1,030$1,047Capital expenditures to support the business(459)(485)Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets,net of cash divested356Free cash flow without sustainability growth investments606568Capital expenditures - sustainability growth investments(61)(65)Free cash flow$545$503During the second quarter of 2023, $553 million was returned to shareholders, including $283 million of cash dividends and $270 million of share repurchases.SUSTAINABILITY GROWTH PROGRAM UPDATEAs the Company advances its sustainability growth investments, management continues to expect that the projects will deliver approximately $740 million in incremental annual adjusted operating EBITDA contributions beginning in 2026, with approximately $500 million coming from renewable energy investments and approximately $240 million coming from recycling investments, with adjustments expected in the timing of adjusted operating EBITDA contributions from sustainability growth investments in the interim years leading up to 2026.(a)Due to customary construction and permitting delays for certain projects, sustainability growth capital spending in 2023 is expected to be about $200 million lower than previously anticipated, with an increase in later years due to this timing shift, inflation, and other factors.In June, the U.S. EPA finalized renewable fuel volume obligations for 2023 through 2025, providing visibility and stability to the market for renewable fuel standard credits. Higher demand for renewable natural gas as a transportation fuel strongly supports the blended average pricing assumption of $26/MMBtu used to develop our investment strategy and strengthens the case for potential upside.In the second quarter, WM opened its Eco Vista renewable natural gas (RNG) facility in Springdale, Ark., the sixth WM-owned RNG facility and the second of the Company’s planned 20 projects in its sustainability growth program.In the second quarter, the Company completed two recycling growth projects, including technology and automation upgrades at its recycling facility in Surprise, Ariz. and the opening of a recycling facility in the Greater Toronto area. The Company’s recycling investments lower labor and processing costs, improve efficiency, and enhance material quality, driving benefits in any commodity market.The Company is focused on executing its sustainability growth strategy as these investments are an important part of WM’s growth trajectory, and management is excited about the long-term value these projects will create for the Company’s customers and shareholders.REVISED 2023 OUTLOOKWith half of the year complete, the Company is updating its full-year outlook to modestly adjust its expectations for 2023. The revised financial outlook considers first half results relative to plan as well as a change in outlook for the second half of the year primarily due to expectations for slower recycled commodity price recovery and lower event-driven volumes.Total Company revenue growth is expected to be between 3.25% and 4.25%, which is lower than prior expectations by 100 basis points at the midpoint. This revision is largely related to the sustainability businesses where electricity and natural gas prices are lower than expected and recycled commodity prices are now expected to be lower during the second half of the year than initially planned. Further, revenue contributions from recycling acquisitions are evolving at a slower pace than expected.WM’s core price outlook remains strong at between 6.5% and 7.0%. Conversion of core price to yield is exceeding expectations and the Company now expects collection and disposal yield to exceed 5.5%.(d)The Company’s overall collection and disposal volume outlook is unchanged and expected to be flat to 2022, though stronger volume contributions are expected from the Company’s strategic accounts business while event-driven landfill volumes are developing slower than planned.(d)Adjusted operating EBITDA is expected to be between $5.775 and $5.875 billion in 2023, which is below prior expectations by $75 million, or about 1%, at the midpoint, with about half of the decline attributed to the sustainability businesses and the remainder due to lower event-driven volumes.(a)Pricing and cost optimization efforts remain on track to deliver targeted improvement in adjusted operating EBITDA margin of at least 40 basis points for the year. At the midpoint of the guidance range, adjusted operating EBITDA margin is expected to be 28.5%, an increase of 50 basis points compared to 2022.(a)The operating EBITDA contributions from the recycling and renewable energy businesses are expected to be between $115 and $135 million lower than 2022, which compares to the Company’s original outlook of a year-over-year decline of $70 to $100 million.(f)Free cash flow is projected to be between $1.675 and $1.775 billion, which is above prior expectations by $175 million at the midpoint. The increase in free cash flow is primarily driven by lower-than-expected capital spending on sustainability growth investments due to a delay in the timing of certain construction projects. Free cash flow excluding targeted sustainability growth investments is expected to be between $2.575 and $2.675 billion, essentially in line with prior guidance.(a)""As we move into the back half of 2023, we remain focused on cost optimization, efficiency improvements, and solid execution on pricing to overcome top-line pressures from lower recycling commodity prices and slower than expected event-driven volumes. We expect this focus to continue to translate into strong margin expansion,"" Fish concluded.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a)The information labeled as adjusted in this press release, as well as free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures. Please see ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below and the reconciliations in the accompanying schedules for more information.(b)Management defines operating EBITDA as GAAP income from operations before depreciation and amortization; this measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.(c)For purposes of this press release, all references to ""Net income"" refer to the financial statement line item ""Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc.""(d)Core price is a performance metric used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of our pricing strategies; it is not derived from our financial statements and may not be comparable to measures presented by other companies. Core price is based on certain historical assumptions, which may differ from actual results, to allow for comparability between reporting periods and to reveal trends in results over time.(e)In the first quarter of 2023, the Company updated its collection and disposal operating EBITDA calculation with a more accurate allocation of costs to this line of business. The Company has restated the prior periods to be consistent with the current year presentation.(f)The Company’s updated 2023 outlook includes an average recycled commodity price of about $60 per ton in 2023, which is a year-over-year decline of about 40% and compares to previous expectations of $70 per ton. The updated 2023 outlook includes the following renewable energy prices: an average value of renewable fuel standard credits of approximately $2.40, which is a year-over-year decline of more than 20% and compares to previous expectations of $2.30; an average natural gas price of about $2.35 per MMBtu, which is a year-over-year decline of nearly 60% and compares to previous expectations of $3.60 per MMBtu; and an average electricity price of about $65 per megawatt hour, which is a year-over-year decline of about 10% and compares to previous expectations of about $70 per megawatt hour.The Company will host a conference call at 10 a.m. ET on July 26, 2023 to discuss the second quarter results.

The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, including financial estimates and forecasts, whether as a result of future events, circumstances or developments or otherwise.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTo supplement its financial information, the Company has presented, and/or may discuss on the conference call, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted net income, adjusted income from operations, adjusted operating EBITDA, adjusted operating EBITDA margin, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted SG&amp;A expenses, and free cash flow, as well as projections of adjusted operating EBITDA and free cash flow. All of these items are non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company reports its financial results in compliance with GAAP but believes that also discussing non-GAAP measures provides investors with (i) financial measures the Company uses in the management of its business and (ii) additional, meaningful comparisons of current results to prior periods’ results by excluding items that the Company does not believe reflect its fundamental business performance and are not representative or indicative of its results of operations.In addition, the Company’s projected future operating EBITDA is anticipated to exclude the effects of other events or circumstances that are not representative or indicative of the Company’s results of operations. Such excluded items are not currently determinable, but may be significant, such as asset impairments and one-time items, charges, gains or losses from divestitures or litigation, and other items. Due to the uncertainty of the likelihood, amount and timing of any such items, the Company does not have information available to provide a quantitative reconciliation of such projection to the comparable GAAP measure.The Company discusses free cash flow and provides a projection of free cash flow because the Company believes that it is indicative of its ability to pay its quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay its debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace ""Net cash provided by operating activities,"" which is the most comparable GAAP measure. The Company believes free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how the Company views its liquidity, but the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that the Company has committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested); this definition may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.The quantitative reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the accompanying schedules, with the exception of projected adjusted operating EBITDA. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(In Millions,

In accordance with revenue recognition guidance, our Company records gross recycling revenue and records rebates paid to customers as cost of goods sold. Other contract structures allow for netting of rebates against revenue.Additionally, there are differences in whether companies adjust for accretion expense in their calculation of EBITDA. Our Company does not adjust for landfill accretion expenses when calculating operating EBITDA, while other companies do adjust it for the calculation of their EBITDA measure.The table below illustrates the impact that differing contract structures and treatment of accretion expense has on the Company’s adjusted operating EBITDA margin results.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 7.00%.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.38 per share, indicating an increase of 5.8% year over year.The consensus mark for revenues is pinned at $4.83 billion, implying growth of 7.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Factors to NoteStryker's MedSurg and Neurotechnology segment witnessed substantial sales growth on the back of robust performance of subsegments in the first quarter. Strong performances in Europe, Australia, Canada and Japan also boosted revenues. This trend is likely to have continued in the second quarter.Growth across Orthopaedics &amp; Spine’s Hip, Knee, and Trauma and Extremities subsegments might have favored the segment's performance on the back of continued procedural growth, strong uptake of the Insignia Hip Stem and the recent launch of the Q Guidance Navigation System.Stryker witnessed both domestic and international growth (in Japan, Korea and emerging markets) in the first quarter of 2023. It is committed to the sustained expansion of Mako, reflecting robust demand for this differentiated robotic technology. This heightened demand is likely to have contributed to the Orthopaedics &amp; Spine segment's performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. However, variability in the hospital environment might have offset some of the gains.The company’s prospects in 2023 seem promising on the back of strong customer demand for its existing as well as new products. However, ongoing hospital staffing pressures and foreign currency movements are likely to have hurt its sales growth.Procedural volumes in China might have suffered a negative impact owing to strict lockdown restrictions across major cities in the country. However, the impact of the economy’s recent reopening is yet to be seen.  The current inflationary pressure is likely to have hurt SYK’s net margin, thereby limiting its growth.Story continuesStryker is working toward alleviating the rising inflationary pressure. It is also taking several cost-cutting initiatives, including restructuring plans.

The program is an expansion of Habitat's existing BuildBetter program that will build more than 250 climate-resilient and energy-efficient homes that will help hundreds of families in need of affordable housing over three years. Jessica's road to home ownership was not easy, but she feels it will change her and her son's lives for the better.Jessica lived with her grandmother for the past few years in her hometown of Berthoud, Colorado. This allowed her to help her grandmother, pay cheaper rent and save money, but she also had to share a room with her nine-year-old son, Eliot, and didn't have enough space for them and their belongings.""I have been craving my independence for a long time, but the state of the housing market has left me feeling like that was out of my reach,"" says Jessica. ""I felt lost and stuck and didn't even know where to start, or even where to turn.""A friend who was approved for a Habitat home urged Jessica to apply to Habitat for Humanity Berthoud's home ownership program. ""I was very skeptical because I doubted that I would be accepted. I was so unsure of myself, but she insisted that I apply and encouraged me to go for it,"" said Jessica. ""I am so glad that she did. I felt like so many people are deserving of this opportunity, but I doubted that I was worthy of it myself.""Jessica applied and was approved in the fall of 2021. She completed financial and homeowner education classes and completed many of her sweat equity hours at the Habitat ReStore. ""I really enjoyed helping the team at the store, as well as helping the customers. I was also able to put in plenty of hours at the building site."" Jessica not only helped construct her own home, but she also worked on her new neighbor's home as well, and helped her get ready to move in.Story continuesJessica's new two-bedroom, two-bathroom home has an on-demand gas hot water heater and a high efficiency gas furnace. In addition, there is above code insulation in the walls and ceiling, and the home is Energy Star rated. The family also received an energy-efficient refrigerator and range, which Whirlpool Corporation donates to every Habitat built home in North America.It was so rewarding to see the house come together from the bones up. Not many people get to help build their house, and it is one of the best feelings I have ever experienced,"" she said. ""I put my blood, sweat and tears into this house and would do it again in a heartbeat.""Jessica feels that the experience of gaining her own home was worth the hard work.

If we look at our costs, our logistics costs have come down. Labor is one cost where I would say inflation has steadied. It's at a more typical rate.

Today's call is being recorded.

Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with a presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com. Before we begin, I want to remind you that as we conduct this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements to assist you in better understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K, 10-Q and other periodic reports. We also want to remind you that today's presentation includes the non-GAAP measures outlined in further detail on Slide 3 of the presentation. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. (Operator Instructions) With that, I'll turn the call over to Marc.Story continuesMarc Robert BitzerThanks, Korey, and good morning, everyone. As you will have noted in our earnings release, we did post another quarter of solid sequential improvement, and it was a quarter which puts us firmly on track towards our full year guidance. If you look at the drivers of this improved performance, we did not get a lot of help from the macro environment. The global industry demand was down, but frankly, that is exactly what we expected. It was instead our consistent and disciplined execution of our operational priorities that drove this improvement. We were able to achieve meaningful cost reductions, we improved our supply chain, our product innovations drove strong consumer demand and we gained market share. In short, we did what we told you we would do. As we're looking towards the second half of 2023, we are leaving our industry demand outlook unchanged. Even though we are starting to see early but clear signs of a strengthening U.S. housing market, which will benefit us disproportionately, the broader consumer sentiment is still cautious and not yet pointing towards more discretionary purchases. We are also seeing the operating environment essentially return to pre-pandemic conditions with stabilized supply chains, improved inventories and a promotional environment which is similar to pre-pandemic levels. Frankly, this is an environment we have demonstrated that we can successfully operate and create value in. Turning to Slide 6, I will provide an overview of our second quarter results. The world we are operating in today is very different from the first half of 2022, where supply chains were fragile, inventories were historically low, promotions were largely absent and inflation was at historically unprecedented levels. In the second half of 2022, we saw global demand shift with industry declines in key countries. We continued to experience this trend into the first half of 2023 with global demand declines in the mid-single digits. Second quarter year-over-year revenue declined 6% versus the prior year, in line with expectations. The promotional landscape is normalizing at pre-pandemic levels, negatively impacting price and mix. Yet, we continue to gain momentum with year-over-year share gains in the Americas through improved supply chains and our strong product lineup. In Q2, we delivered a strong operating margin of 7.3%. This represents a 200 basis point expansion from the first quarter, driven by our strong cost takeout actions. These actions delivered $150 million of year-over-year benefit and are on track to our full year target of $800 million to $900 million of cost takeout and delivered strong second quarter ongoing earnings per share of $4.21, in line with expectations. Now turning to Slide 7, I will share more details on our second quarter EBIT margin. The second quarter was unfavorably impacted by the normalization of promotions, which reemerged in the second half 2022, and are now following historical seasonal trends. Sequentially, price/mix negatively impacted margins by 50 basis points with a year-over-year impact of 350 basis points. Our strong cost takeout actions delivered 275 basis points both sequentially and year-over-year. And as expected, marketing &amp; technology and foreign currency negatively impacted margins. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter performance, delivering ongoing EBIT margin of 7.3%. Turning to Slide 8, you can see we are on track to deliver $800 million to $900 million of year-over-year cost takeout benefits, including $300 million to $400 million of reduced raw material costs and $500 million of additional cost takeout actions driven by enhanced supply chain resiliency, reduced parts complexity with approximately 50% fewer parts since 2021 and improved transportation rates and reduced premium freight costs. Additionally, in aggregate, we have reduced our salaried workforce by 7% and remain disciplined with discretionary spending and other indirect costs. The cost actions we took over the past quarters were fully on track towards delivering our cost takeout targets. While the chart shows high year-over-year cost reduction in Q3 and Q4, it is important to note that this is entirely driven by the baseline effects in the second half of 2022 and will not require additional new cost takeout actions. Now I will turn it over to Jim to review our regional results.James W. PetersThanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10, I'll review results for our North America region. Year-over-year share gains and the addition of InSinkErator was more than offset by industry decline of 1% and increased promotions, resulting in 5% revenue decline. The region delivered sequential margin expansion with solid double-digit EBIT margins of 10.3% as our strong cost takeout actions continue to gain traction alongside the integration of InSinkErator. We expect the region to deliver 100-plus basis point margin expansion each quarter driven by strong cost takeout actions. We are confident in the structural strength of our North America business and continue to expect our actions to deliver strong results, exiting the year with 12% to 13% EBIT margins. Turning to Slide 11, I'll provide additional color around the U.S. housing market. During our earnings call in October of 2022, we presented our upbeat long-term view on the U.S. housing market. Nothing has changed, and we are very optimistic about mid- and long-term housing-driven demand trends, currently representing 15% of the total industry demand. New housing construction has significantly lagged historical averages for more than a decade. For perspective, there was only 1 year in the 40 years prior to the Great Recession in which fewer than 1.2 million new homes were built. Much of the period between 2007 and 2017 was below this level, leading to the oldest U.S. housing stock in the country's history. In total, we estimate 3 million to 4 million unit undersupply of housing. While we do not expect housing starts to reach a steady state of supply to fill this gap in the near term, we do believe housing starts will begin to increase to 1.7 million units annually or higher due to the housing shortage. Turning to Slide 12, you can see we are well positioned to capture this trend as the #1 choice for homebuilders. The combination of: one, the best brand portfolio with multiple $1 billion brands, including Whirlpool, Maytag and KitchenAid; two, an innovative product portfolio that targets 90% of the consumers; and three, our strong final-mile delivery capabilities across the region, strongly positions Whirlpool to drive value creation as the housing market rebounds. With every new home having a full suite of typically 5 new appliances, it is not surprising that we have become the #1 choice for U.S. homebuilders, serving 8 of the top 10 national builders. Turning to Slide 13, I'll review our results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Organic second quarter revenue was down approximately 12%, driven by continued industry demand weakness across key countries. EMEA margin expansion was driven by strong cost takeout actions alongside held-for-sale accounting benefits due to reduced depreciation that will continue each quarter until the transaction closes, which is expected in Q4 of this year. Turning to Slide 14, I'll review the results for our Latin America region. The region saw demand improvement in Mexico and year-over-year share gains resulting in a 4% revenue increase. Inflationary pressures were partially offset by higher volumes, resulting in solid EBIT margins of 6.5%. Turning to Slide 15, I'll review results for our Asia region. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue declined approximately 8%, driven by consumer demand weakness. Sequential share gains drove a 15% revenue increase compared to the first quarter. The region delivered EBIT margins of 3.7% with our strong cost takeout actions offset by negative price/mix. Turning to Slide 16, I will discuss our full year guidance. We are reaffirming our ongoing EPS range of $16 to $18 and free cash flow guidance of approximately $800 million. We continue to expect to deliver approximately 60% of our full year earnings in the second half of the year, driven by our cost structure reset. We now expect to deliver EBIT margins of 7.25% as promotional spend has slightly increased and demand weakness in EMEA has been greater than anticipated. Our guidance also includes updated expectations for our adjusted effective tax rate, now 10% to 15% for the year. As the Europe transaction progresses, we will continue to assess the adjusted tax rate, which has the potential to be at the low end of our range. We continue to expect to deliver $800 million of free cash flow. Turning to Slide 17, we show the drivers of our updated full year ongoing EBIT margin guidance. We have updated our expectation of price/mix by 25 basis points to a negative 250 basis point impact reflecting a global promotional environment at pre-pandemic levels. All other margin drivers remain unchanged. We now expect to deliver solid margins of 7.25% for the year. Turning to Slide 18, we show our regional guidance. We see no change to our full year regional industry expectations. While second quarter North America industry shipments were slightly favorable versus our prior expectation, this was largely driven by retailer restocking and slightly higher retailer inventory levels. The consumer sellout was relatively stable with a low single-digit decline. And while there might be some uptick in consumer demand driven by the housing rebound, consumer sentiment in the region continues to be impacted by macro uncertainty. Therefore, our market assumptions are unchanged. Overall, we expect continued EBIT margin expansion driven by our strong cost takeout actions as well as raw material inflation tailwinds. In North America, we expect to deliver full year margins of approximately 11.5% with the region's strong cost takeout actions partially offsetting a promotional environment that is at normal pre-pandemic levels. We expect to partially offset the impact of the promotional environment with positive mix driven by a strong lineup of new product introductions delivering year-over-year share gains. We now expect EMEA to deliver approximately 1.5% margins as the region continues to be impacted by soft consumer sentiment. Lastly, EBIT margin expectations for Latin America and Asia remain unchanged. Now I will turn the call over to Marc.Marc Robert BitzerThanks, Jim. Turning to Slide 20, let me provide an update on our portfolio transformation. Whirlpool today is very different from Whirlpool of the past. In the last 5 years, we have taken several significant steps to transform the company into a higher-growth, higher-margin business based on 3 structural pillars: small appliances, major appliances and commercial appliances. These steps in changing our company portfolio laid the foundation for a company with a double-digit EBIT margin profile, which is very different from our historic mid- to high-single-digit profile. As we look forward, we are reassessing our operating segment structure in anticipation of a potential change after the completion of the Europe transaction. During one of our future earnings calls, we expect to share more information about our assessment and potential re-segmentation, specifically about our strong value-creating small domestic appliance business. Turning to Slide 21, I will provide an update on InSinkErator and how it is strengthening our portfolio. Our integration efforts are well underway and nearing completion after acquiring InSinkErator in Q4 2022. InSinkErator's rich history and strong product legacy had us very excited about the brand's largest launch, NextGen, which we presented during our last earnings call. We continue to be pleased with the sustained EBIT margins of approximately 20%, contributing approximately 50 basis points to our consolidated EBIT margins. Turning to Slide 22, I will provide an update on our EMEA transaction. In January, we agreed to contribute our European major domestic appliance business into a newly formed entity with Arçelik. The Europe transaction and the regulatory processes are ongoing and progressing as expected, including executing an agreement to sell our Middle East and Africa business. We continue to expect to close the Europe transaction in the fourth quarter of 2023. Until then, we will continue to focus on EMEA delivering the best products and consumer-preferred brands. Let me also remind you of the benefits of this transaction. We will own approximately 25% of a new company, which will be well positioned to deliver value to consumers through attractive brands, sustainable manufacturing, product innovation and best-in-class consumer services. And it's expected to have over EUR 6 billion of annual sales with of over EUR 200 million of cost synergies. We have a potential to unlock long-term value creation through our ability to monetize our minority interest. Coupled with a 40-year Whirlpool brand licensing agreement, we expect $750 million net present value of future cash flows. Additionally, post closing, we expect the transaction to improve our value creation metrics by $250 million of incremental free cash flows and 150 basis points improvement in ongoing EBIT margin. Turning to Slide 23, I will discuss our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged. We remain committed to funding innovation and growth and expect to invest over $1 billion in capital expenditures and research and development this year. Additionally, we are confident in our ability to generate strong free cash flows. This, coupled with our balance sheet strength, provides us the flexibility to support our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. In the first half of 2023, we returned $193 million in cash to shareholders, representing nearly 70 consecutive years of dividends. Turning to Slide 24, let me further discuss our commitment to maintaining our strong investment-grade credit rating. We are confident that we are well on our way to delivering debt leverage to below historical norms and towards our target of 2x or below with $1.3 billion cash on hand and strong free cash flow which, as mentioned earlier, we expect to be $250 million higher after the close of the Europe transaction. We continue to prioritize debt repayment with approximately $500 million of acquisition-related term loan paydown expected by the end of the year. Turning to Slide 25, I will review our healthy debt ladder and how it gives us flexibility and derisks our balance sheet. We have an attractive weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.25% with 70% of our debt held at a fixed rate of just over 3%. Additionally, over $2 billion of our debt is due after 2030. This gives us a balance sheet flexibility to deliver strong shareholder returns and maintain our solid investment-grade rating. Turning to Slide 26, let me close with a few remarks. Despite a dynamic external environment, we delivered another solid quarter with sustained margin expansion. Through strong execution of our operational priorities, we delivered results in line with our expectations and remain on track to deliver $16 to $18 of ongoing earnings per share and approximately $800 million of free cash flow. More importantly, the strength of our brands and products is resonating with consumers with 1 point of year-over-year share gains. With our strong position as the U.S. builders' #1 choice and serving 8 of the top 10 national builders, Whirlpool is well positioned to benefit from a housing-driven demand recovery, and we continue to unlock value with our ongoing portfolio transformation. Now we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan.Michael Jason RehautFirst question, I wanted to hit on the promotional environment, if I could. You kind of mentioned it's now reverted back to pre-pandemic levels, which I guess is maybe a little higher than perhaps you were expecting at the beginning of the year, and it appears the driver of the reduced North American margin outlook. I was hoping to get a sense from you in terms of how this affects -- how this might affect price cost in the back half and into '24? And also, from a margin perspective in North America, I believe last quarter, you were expecting to end the year at roughly 14%. Just want to get a sense of how that changes and how we should think about the new baseline for the business outside of additional price/mix gains in '24.Marc Robert BitzerFirst of all, Mike, it's Marc. So let me try to answer that fairly wide question. On the promotional environment first, you asked a question about where we expect -- is it higher than we expected. I would rather call it the promotion normality came earlier than expected. And what I mean with that, we always assumed that at one point, the normal promotional environment will return back to pre-pandemic levels. Honestly, we probably would have expected more close to Q3, Q4, and it now basically came in Q2. So that's, as such, not a surprise. It just happened 1 or 2 quarters earlier. That's the only change. The level of promotional depth is, frankly, not surprising relative to what we've seen pre-pandemic. So I wouldn't see that as an overly concern. Well, in that context, what I really want to remind everybody on the call is -- and refer back to Page 7 of our presentation because I think that tells the full story, and I think it's very helpful in that context because you see both a year-over-year comparison on our margin walk and the sequential. If you first start on the year-over-year comparison, you see, and Jim alluded to this one earlier, yes, there is a big price/mix decline year-over-year. But I really want to remind everybody, Q1 and Q2 last year were pretty much the last quarter basically absent of any promotion. It was basically kind of a dark period from a promotion perspective. These promotions started to kind of resume in the marketplace in Q3 and Q4. So you saw the slow ramp-up. So as such, yes, the year-over-year comparisons look big, but that's not surprising given that we all knew promotions are coming back into the market. The more relevant perspective and we pointed towards with already in the last earnings call is right now the sequential look. Sequentially, over Q1, we lost 0.5 point of market share. Keep in mind, Q2 in the marketplace has Memorial Day and July 4th in there. So by definition, it's a little bit more promotional-heavy than the Q1 is. So the 0.5 price decline, I wouldn't call that out of a norm. Even more relevant is when you look at relative the cost takeout. Sequentially, we took 2.75 points of cost out. Put it differently, basically, we basically reinvested in the marketplace 20% of our cost takeout. I would call that as a very measured and reasonable approach to approaching promotions. And frankly, it worked for us because we picked up market share and we expanded our overall margin by 2 points. So put that all in context, I would consider the promotional environment, yes, we're back to pre-pandemic levels. We know how to operate in that environment very successfully as we have evidenced over many years and I think as we have evidenced in Q2. Now more specifically also to the North American margin, we expect North American margin by year-end to be around 12% to 13%. And also coming back to this pre-pandemic margin run rate, that was pretty much a margin run rate we had coming into the pandemic. It was around 12% or 12 plus in North America. And yes, we fully expect that to be back on that level and then we can see where we can expand it from there on.Michael Jason RehautGreat. No, I appreciate that, Marc. Secondly, I wanted to hit on InSinkErator for a little bit. I wanted to get a little color or more granularity on how the product launch is unfolding and what that's contributing to the business. And also just in context of that or maybe in addition to that, I think more broadly, I think you did notch down the full year revenue contribution outlook. So I wanted to understand the drivers of that as well.Marc Robert BitzerYes. And Michael, again, let me give a context on InSinkErator. First of all, we are very pleased with that business. The margins hold up very strongly. It's up 20% plus. So it's a very EBIT-accretive business. We like the team. We like the product lineup. We like the production efficiency. It is a very, very strong business. There's obviously 2 factors. One is a broader revenue. I would say, InSinkErator is even more exposed to the U.S. housing market than our normal appliance business. And as such, we always expected the first half or the first 3 quarters of this year will be somewhat soft from housing before the housing fully rebounds. So that is one element, but hasn't changed in terms of where we are from a market share perspective on InSinkErator. The second part, in particular, on the new product introduction of NextGen, first of all, you need to know that NextGen carries margins which are stronger than the rest of the line. So inherently, it's a margin-accretive product. And right now, you're going through what we call the phase-in and phase-out. So we started the first shipments actually in July. So that is now underway. But in the short term, given that we have product placement cost and the phase-in/phase-out costs, which we do not capitalize, we take it into our ongoing cost, it's actually even a slight burden in both Q2 and Q3. But the inherent margin of NextGen is very attractive, and we're now fully in the process of ramping up the production. And we would expect the full sales element of a new product to be fully visible in Q4.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research.David Sutherland MacGregorI wonder if you could just talk a little bit about volume demand or market demand right now. I mean we had the core 6 number out that you indicated in your prepared remarks included some restock. I wonder if there's any way of just giving us a sense of what you're seeing right now in terms of replacement demand versus the builder channel, which you've highlighted is a growing importance to you, versus maybe discretionary demand is obviously down. But just try and unbundle that for us to give us a better understanding of just the composition of the volume growth.Marc Robert BitzerDavid, it's a very good question. So first of all, it's a little bit similar to what we already qualitatively alluded from Q1, the discretionary side of the demand continues to remain soft, and we see that in the major appliances. And I think as one of your colleagues pointed out, we see it almost in small domestic appliances. That's the nature of discretionary demand, which is right now still impacted by uncertainty in consumer sentiment, which is still not in the positive territory. What is holding up strong is replacement side, as we always expected, because we said post-pandemic becomes increased usage of appliance, which drive replacement demand, and that is holding up very strong. To put it on in the numbers, as you've seen the kind of industry, and I'm more referring to U.S. industry, shipments were minus 1%. In all transparency, the consumer sellout, we expected to be slightly weaker, and we think it was around minus 3%, minus 4%, pretty much in line with what we initially guided the industry shipments to. The difference is retailers were restocking what were pretty low inventory levels. So there's a restocking element in there, and that explains the difference. Now going forward, as you know, we left the industry assumption unchanged, frankly, because there's still uncertainty out there. Now -- but there are clear, and that's probably to your point, clear signs and data points about the housing recovery. And what I'm referring to, I mean, in this morning, a number of nationally recognized big builders came up with numbers, the order intake of the builders is very strong across the board. You do the math, to pick an order, translates into an appliance shipment anywhere 6 to 10 months after the order comes. That's just the time it takes to build the house. And as you know, appliance always come in last when the house has been completed. So we do know there's a significant momentum building on the builder side. The only question is, how much of that will fall into the calendar year of '23 versus '24? But it will come because these orders are real and that I think we've seen now 6 or 7 builders have really impressive order intake. So that potentially could translate into some upside on the industry shipment. But right now, we've been reluctant to already update that because, again, there's still uncertainty on the discretionary side. But we know, and we see it, the housing momentum is starting to build, and that's very, very positive news for us.David Sutherland MacGregorAnd then just as a follow-up, you talked about the cost takeout program, and you've got some very well-defined goals for 2023. And you mentioned most of that is just coming from the year-ago comp. What does that imply in terms of the 2024 carryover benefit at this point?James W. PetersYes. David, this is Jim. And what I'd start with is, first off, we are extremely happy with, as you said, that we're on track to deliver the $800 million to $900 million. And we're seeing what we expected in raw materials. I think as we look forward, and we haven't and we won't give guidance yet, at least on next year, but as we look forward, there are some of these actions, obviously, as we've had headcount reduction via attrition throughout the year, but also different projects we've implemented that have reduced costs within our products that will carry over into next year. I mean, if you look on a typical basis, and as we've always said that we typically, in any year, target to do at least 0.5 to 1 point of cost reduction. Typically, give or take, 25% to 35%, 40% of that is carryover. So right now, at this point in time, we don't have a specific number, but we do expect to come into next year with some strong tailwinds from a cost perspective.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs.Susan Marie MaklariMy first question is around the mix. Are you saying that, that has been changing either positively or negatively for you? And what role is that having within that price/mix shift that we're seeing?Marc Robert BitzerSusan, it's Marc. I think overall, we don't see the big mix down effect, which some people have referred to, and in particular North America. Actually, if you would look in the detail, our JennAir business, our KitchenAid business are performing very well. So we feel pretty good about it. Coupled with that, we have a couple of product introduction like the Maytag Pet, the dishwasher, which really are just [re-lifting] the mix. So -- and of course, mix also going forward will be a major lever to offset any promotion pressure. So I would say in general terms, for North America, but it's also pretty true for most available regions, there's a slight positive mix, and that is right now offset by the promotion pressure out there. But again, mix, in particular for product innovation, so far has been a good guy for us.Susan Marie MaklariOkay. That's helpful. And then you're targeting the $300 million to $400 million in terms of raw materials for the year. Can you talk about any changes to where you expect to fall within that range, especially as perhaps some of the raws have moved over the last few months and what that could imply for the back half of the year?James W. PetersYes, Susan, this is Jim. And what I would say is, if you remember in Q1, as we kind of, at the end of Q1, we talked about, we thought we're at the lower end of that range as we were looking at where the commodity prices were. Now as we look at where we are today and what happened within the second quarter, commodity prices have improved some, but we're still within the range. And whether we're at the midpoint or slightly better than the midpoint, we're probably at that point. So it won't have a significant impact for us in the back half of the year against what we guided before, what we're guiding now, because it's still within that range that we thought. So I don't think it's going to be a big impact for us. And then as I mentioned earlier, we won't be guiding for next year until later, until in January of 2024.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.Samuel John DarkatshA couple of questions. First off, getting back to North America margins, specific second half versus first half, it looks like you're guiding, I don't know, somewhere around 13% or so in the back half versus the 10% in the first half. I think we can back into the sequential benefits of RMI and cost takeout, and we can guess at pricing. But the one thing we really can't see externally is your volume production plans sequentially. There's a lot of moving pieces, obviously, with market share and moving expectations around volumes. But can you be specific as to what you're expecting for volume production, specifically in the second half versus the first half?Marc Robert BitzerSam, it's Marc. First of all, again, first half in our margins, we're now 10.15% over 10.2% in the back half. And we said earlier, we expect to exit with 12% to 13%, which again essentially is spot on to pre-pandemic level in North America margin. First of all, structurally, as you know, there is a little bit of a seasonal element in the back half over first half. One is volume-related because you tend to ship more in the second half than the first half. And the second part is our more seasonal business, in particular KitchenAid, the mix of which, as you know, is margin-accretive, tends to be a little bit higher in the back half. So these are the structural elements. Now specifically to the question about production level of inventory, I think you're rightfully pointing out to last year, we had to take down production significantly in Q3 and Q4. But frankly, it's a fairly costly manner to do it. I would say right now coming into Q3, I think we're much better balanced. And we feel very good about right now our inventory levels. Our supply chain is basically, except for some very small residual items, is running very smoothly. So I don't see this kind of the need for this draconian action, which we had to undertake in Q3 and Q4. So as such, we expect a pretty leveled production volume similar to Q1, Q2.Samuel John DarkatshAnd then my second question, the corporate overhead line bounces around a lot, and it's hard for us to model. And it looks like it was considerably below at least where we were thinking. I was imagining it was going to be maybe a $70 million quarterly run rate, excluding items, and it came in around, call it, around $20 million or so. What was that due to? I'm guessing it was a confluence of items, but what were the primary drivers of that? How should we model that corporate overhead number going forward, Jim?James W. PetersYes, Sam, and here's what I think you should do is if you kind of look back historically over the last, let's just say, 3 years or even longer than that, typically, on an average, we run between $50 million and $60 million per quarter in that line. And if you actually take where we are year-to-date, I think we're at like $47 million, $48 million. So I think you should continue to model at that type of number, especially maybe a little bit closer to the lower end of that range because some of our cost takeout actions we're doing are obviously falling into there, so you'd be slightly lower than historical averages. Now specific items that drive changes within there, I'm not going to get into a lot of them, but obviously, you have certain accruals that can be related to employee-related expenses or certain accruals that can be related to some of the legal cases that we're resolving in EMEA as we close that out. And so those just caused some fluctuations between quarters, but we -- for a full year, we do not expect to be outside of our normal range of $50 million to $60 million average per quarter.Marc Robert BitzerSo Sam, maybe just adding to what Jim was alluding to, again, and the corporate expense base has 2 structural items. One is the ongoing corporate, call it, infrastructure cost, [year 1] are kind of all these one-timers, Hybrid deal costs or other actions. So of course, the latter one is always a little bit difficult to model because that's the nature of the ins and outs. But it's important to look also the underlying of corporate infrastructure. As we alluded to in our remarks, our prepared remarks, our overall salaried workforce is down 7% year-over-year. That is a very, very significant number. And that is also visible in our corporate expenses. Keep in mind, we are starting to reposition our corporate headquarters basically to a potential post-Europe environment. So we took proactive measures. And as such, our ongoing corporate expenses were lower than they were several years ago. So there is also this element which is just structurally and structurally lower than it was a couple of years before.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.Eric BosshardTwo questions, if I could. I guess, first, for Jim, just a housekeeping question. The comment was made that mix was stable. I'm curious, can you just help us understand the North American organic revenue, as InSinkErator looks like it's down then 7%, 8%, 9%, and it sounds like your units are up better than the industry, what -- is that all price? Can you just help us understand the mechanics between the gap between your dollar decline and your apparent unit volume growth?James W. PetersYes. So as you said that year-over-year, we did pick up share, and so that would obviously be a positive. Still within the quarter, as we said, the industry was down slightly, so that would be a negative. And then as Marc talked about earlier with the promotional environment, that's your incremental piece that you just have to take off of the top there to say -- and again, when you're looking year-over-year, as he highlighted earlier, last year in the first half of the year, it was -- there were not many promotions at that point in time. So that's having a significant impact year-over-year. But then as we get to the back half of the year, it will have much less of an impact, and that's why you see the full year average for price/mix being below where this quarter is when you walk it year-over-year.Marc Robert BitzerEric, it's Marc. The additional comment I want to make is that you keep in mind, when we show the North America business, there is the U.S. core business or when you have other elements like InSinkErator, KitchenAid, small domestic appliance and you have Canada in there. The pure U.S. core business was better than the number which we showed for North America. What hurt us in Q2 was Canada was fairly weak. And Canada had, the last couple of years, very strong years, and this year is kind of way softer than the prior year from an industry perspective. And the small domestic appliance business was also softer than prior year. So these were 2 offsetting items, but the U.S. core business was slightly better than the number you see here.Eric BosshardOkay. And then secondly, a strategic question, I guess, for you, Marc, which is from a promotional standpoint, I'm curious how -- what your thoughts are. I guess, first of all, is the promotional environment now stable or more intense in the back half than the first half? And then within this, are you here planning to focus on participating and maintaining or improving market share? Or is your focus more on margin and less on promotion and share? I'm just curious how we should think about that relative to your guidance.Marc Robert BitzerYes, Eric. So first of all, I would describe the promotional environment, it's back to normal. Okay? I know that sounds boring, but that's pretty much it. And we know how to operate in that environment fairly effectively and efficiently, which also means we've always said we will participate in promotions as long as they're value creating. Also from an overall margin and margin expansion, of course, we are kind of -- there will always be an element where some of the cost savings, you have to reinvest in the marketplace. We've done that in Q2, and the math overall worked for us very well where we expanded market share and expanded margin. And that is also going to be our -- the balancing act going forward. We want to continue to win market share, but we certainly will expand also our margins. So that's the balancing act. So again, overall, the promotional environment, it just came a little bit earlier, but it's right now not to levels which kind of -- which we wouldn't know how to operate in. We know and feel very confident about the cost takeout, and some of that will be reinvested in the marketplace, but not all of it.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets.Michael Glaser DahlMarc, just a follow-up on that. Presumably, some of your competitors have some cost tailwinds as well, maybe not to the same extent as you do, given some of your company-specific items and not just the RMI tailwinds. But in an environment where gross prices have still risen substantially over the past few years, sellout is a little soft and costs are down across the industry, what -- how do you handicap the risk of just the other competitors leaning more into promotion and reinvesting more some of the overall cost tailwinds into promotion here in the back half?Marc Robert BitzerYes. Michael, I can only repeat what I said before. First of all, the raw materials, yes, it's probably fair to assume that it's more or less most people kind of benefit from the same tailwinds. Now with different color, keep in mind that North American raw materials were particularly bad the last couple of years, worse than some of the Asian raw materials. So I would say, right now, you come to a period where the North America production slightly gets more raw material benefit than an Asian production. So that is already one differentiating element. I would say, on the company-specific cost takeout actions, and you've seen that before, I mean, our own numbers, more than half of our cost takeout is discrete to us. That's what we are doing, okay? I would pride ourselves, we took actions early and fairly decisive. So I would see -- we see some of these cost elements or reductions probably earlier and more than most other competitors. Now I mean, obviously, we've got to see. So as such, we feel confident about our cost takeout. We know how to operate in a promotional environment, as was evidenced and demonstrated in Q2. From that perspective, I don't expect a change in the back half relative to what we've seen right now around July 4th.Michael Glaser DahlGot it. Okay. And then just a follow-up. With respect to inventory in the channel, I mean, inventory was running fairly lean. You called out some restock. How would you characterize inventory at retail now? Is it back to normal? Is it still climbing back toward normal off of levels that are still, you characterized, too lean? Or are there any pockets where you think there's now, relative to the sellout environment, potentially a little too much?Marc Robert BitzerYes, Michael. First of all, we got to recognize and remind ourselves, the last 3 years, we've seen extreme swings on manufacturer and retail inventory levels. I mean this was a bullwhip effect, up and down, and that's what we've seen in the last couple of years. I think we're now back to a normal environment on many fronts, including trade inventories, which I would consider back-to-normal trade inventory levels. And basically, the retailers over the last half year took -- basically took an advantage of restocking to required levels, and that's how we would look at this one. But right now, from what we've seen, we don't see excessive inventories out there. You also know there's one trade customer who doesn't carry inventory. So it's not -- they're not excessive inventories out there. Again, I would just describe them as normal retail inventory levels, which we see out there and which are basically all pointing to this post-pandemic environment normalcy.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Liz Suzuki from Bank of America.Elizabeth Lane SuzukiSo just as we think about the ongoing tax rate in 2024 and beyond, I mean, what do you think is kind of a normalized level? It's obviously quite suppressed this year. But just as we think going forward and, I mean, I know you're not giving 2024 guidance, but in just any normal year, what do you think a tax rate should be that we incorporate into our models?James W. PetersYes. So Liz, this is Jim. And historically, we have said that we thought the tax rate on an ongoing basis and on a cash basis would be closer to the 2025 rate over an extended period of time. Now what I would say is as we go through our divestiture of EMEA, we have a significant amount of tax assets there that have resulted from losses that we've incurred over the years and funded and paid for already. And as we go through this process, we're really looking at our ability to utilize many of those because like I said, these are losses that we did incur. And what we're finding is that we're finding more and more opportunity to continue to utilize those. And so that's why this year, we think, similar to last year, we're going to be in the 10% to 15% range. I think over a midterm, we could see a rate that's below that historical thing that I was quoting of 20% to 25% and maybe even closer to the 15% to 20% at least for a period of time or closer to the 15%. But until we get to the end of this year, we get through all of this transaction, we look at the global footprint that we have and the remainder and then we look at the assets that we have, it's hard for us to give a longer-term guidance, but I do believe it will be better than we've set historically. And in addition to that, I do believe we'll be able to realize significant amount of just cash benefits over the period of years as we utilize some of those losses that we've already incurred.Elizabeth Lane SuzukiGot it. That makes sense. And just a follow-up on the price/mix guidance, which for the year is estimated to be below what the first half is tracking at. I mean, is most of that improvement in the back half of the year easier comparisons? Or do you think it's -- is it more going to be concentrated in the homebuilder side of the business versus retail? I'm just curious how you think about pricing by channel as we get into the back half.Marc Robert BitzerThis is Marc. I can take it. I'll basically fully come back to the earlier comments. By definition, you have baseline effects of last year. Keep in mind, first half last year basically had no promotions, and they were building in the second half. So that's the element of where the comparison is getting a lot easier in the back half because, again, every quarter, the promotions have been building. So as such, I mean, this 2.5 on a full year base of just a quarter difference versus what we had in mind, but just a reflection is, yes, we saw the normal promotional environment kind of one quarter earlier when we originally expected, but not fundamentally different from baseline and where we expected the year-end to be. So I think with that, we -- that was pretty much the last question which we had. And I want to take the opportunity to thank you all for joining us today. Hopefully, as you heard before, we feel very good about the Q2. I mean this was a quarter with 200 basis points of margin expansion, which is a significant step-up. It's a step-up fully back to pre-pandemic margin run rates. You also see or heard that we kind of -- we start seeing positive signals on the market demand environment more towards the end of the year, but they're undeniable. And they will, at one point, provide tailwinds for us for our industry, and we feel good about it. So with that, we feel good about where we are in Q2, puts us on track towards reaffirming our full year guidance. And I'm looking forward to talk to you again at the Q3 earnings call. Thanks a lot for joining us.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.]"

Whirlpool Vice President and CFO Jim Peters joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the appliance company's macro conditions tied to the future completion of new homes and how it is cutting-costs with device redesigns and a logistics overhaul.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Consumers pulling back on purchases of home appliances. Whirlpool saw weaker demand for its products this quarter despite signs of inflationary pressures easing. The company posted mixed results for the second quarter, beating adjusted earnings per share expectations. Sales, though, falling 6% from the prior year to $4.7 billion, just shy of analysts' estimates.Joining us now is Jim Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Whirlpool. Jim, it's great to see you. We love checking in with you to talk about what's going on in the world of appliances. I just want to start big picture with what you guys are seeing in terms of demand. Talk me through it.JIM PETERS: Yeah. And good morning. Good to be with you guys again today.You know, what we're seeing in terms of demand, you could probably break down into three different buckets here. And if you think about our business, there's a big part of it that's replacement, and that's 50% to 55% of the appliances we sell. And that actually, that segment, is relatively stable and strong, and pretty predictable.The next part is what we'll call discretionary spend, and that's about 30% of our business or 30% of the industry. That's the segment right now that I would say the consumer is still relatively tentative in. And part of that is driven by existing home sales are still relatively low. And if you think about it, when people buy an existing home, one of the few things they do change out when they move in might be the appliances. So that segment right now, we would say, is below where we expected but is relatively stable.Story continuesNow, the last part of the industry in our business, which is about 15% for us, is new home construction. And we're beginning to see that pick up. And I think you've seen in the last couple of weeks, a couple of the large builders come out and be rather positive, and we're seeing the same thing.We're beginning to see their business pick up, which means in about six months. Our business picks up as those homes are completed. So, as I said, it's probably a mixed bag on demand within the US. And then, if you go outside the US, part of what impacted us within the quarter is that demand in EMEA was down by about 10%. And that's just the macroeconomic environment there and lower consumer sentiment.But, as I said, in the US, we are positive on the demand in the future, and we do believe we'll begin to see some of that pick up. And with people who can't find existing homes, many of them will turn to remodels at some point, which then falls in that discretionary bucket for us.- Jim, it's Brian. Good to see you, as always. How fast will that rebound in the US housing market take place?This week, we're supposed to get what could be the last interest rate hike for this cycle from the Federal Reserve. What does that mean to the next six to 12 months in the housing sector?JIM PETERS: Yeah. That's a good question. Like I said, we're already seeing the signs of new home construction pick up. As people who are in the market for a home and couldn't find an existing home due to low inventory.And the reason there's low inventory is many of us know, it's with mortgage rates where they are. Nobody wants to give up on their two and 1/2, 3% mortgage to take on a 7% mortgage right now. So we expect to see that pick up in new home construction over the next six to 12 months.I think, then, as you look to next year, we would expect to begin to see, as interest rates stabilize, and it's kind of been absorbed and normalized within the marketplace. You'll begin to see some of those existing home sales pick up. But, you know, right now, I'd say new home construction will be the first thing to show signs of growth.JULIE HYMAN: And Jim, for the people who are buying new appliances, what kind of choices are they making? Because I know you guys have-- you've been doing more, sales more promotions. But, at the same time, you've been leaning into some of your higher end stuff.I know you guys bought InSinkErator. I am an InSinkErator owner myself, with a kitchen reno that I did. So, how many people are making those higher end decisions right now of your customers?JIM PETERS: Yeah. I would say, the mix-- and first off, thank you for buying InSinkErator. But the mix of our customers we see right now is relatively stable and pretty much in line with what we saw historically and especially pre-COVID. Now, as I mentioned, as new home construction picks up, what you do start to get is a disproportionate amount of kitchen appliances because every new home takes on average, around five appliances. The majority of those being kitchen appliances. So that's the categories that we expect to see pick up.I'd say, right now, though, our balance of sale or our mix of product is relatively similar to what had been in the past, as well as our mix of brands. We still are seeing the consumers buying in the premium space, and also in the mass space. So, despite the fact that the promotional environment has returned to levels that we would have seen before COVID, I'd say, consumers are still buying at that premium, and especially, that mass premium segment right now.- And Jim, I put this question to General Motors CFO this morning, and I'll put it to you. Do you think inflation has peaked for this cycle? Are you confident that you can say that?JIM PETERS: I would say, listen, we from a material cost perspective, we saw the peak probably late last year. You know, and if we look at other costs, our logistics costs have come down. I'd say, labor is the one cost that-- what I would say is that it's inflation is probably steadied there, and it's at a more typical rate.Obviously, I don't think labor costs will come back down. But we have seen-- we talked about our material costs for the year, we saw about a 300 to 400 million deflation in our total material costs, and in our logistics costs, and other things like that, we saw similar levels of deflation. So, I do believe, at least for our business, when you take it in aggregate, inflation has peaked. But if you break it down among the components, there's still a few areas where we are seeing some inflation.- One of the things that always has amazed me, Jim, and I used to cover Whirlpool as an analyst more than a decade ago is the management team's ability to always find cost savings somewhere in large quantities. So this year, how much will you find in terms of cost savings? And then, what's left for next year?JIM PETERS: Well, right now, we're targeting and we expect to deliver about $800 to $900 million of cost savings. Now, as I said, the first three to 400% of that is just raw material deflation. Then, when you look at our products, within our products, as we launch new products all the time, we have the opportunity to just look at how do we take material cost out of the product, use different components, develop it in a different way, different engineering specs, whatever they are.Then, additionally, this year, we've talked about is that we've been able to reduce our headcount or overall headcount by about 7%. We didn't do any big layoffs or reduction of force, we just managed our attrition very well, which allowed us to bring those costs down. So-- and then, I talked about logistics costs coming down, and we continue to optimize our logistics network to try and bring those costs down even further.As we look forward to next year, I think we see next year as an environment that we can continue to reduce our costs within. And typically, we've talked about on our earnings calls that in just any given year, taking costs and inflation to be relatively stable, we still would target about half a point to a point of cost reduction within our margin walk. And that's at least what we see as we head into a new year.Right now, it's a little bit early to predict what the market might be from a materials and logistics costs and other things, but I do expect next year to be another year of cost reduction for us.JULIE HYMAN: Jim, I want to turn to the innovation front before we let you go because just a small thing we were showing some video washing machine where you can take the agitator out to fit different stuff in there, which is a small thing, but exciting from a laundry perspective.JIM PETERS: Well, that's cool. No, that's cool.JULIE HYMAN: Sure. I'm just curious what you're most excited about on the innovation front? What you're seeing? What new products you're coming out with that you think consumers are going to be excited about as well?JIM PETERS: Yeah. Well-- and I'd say, this year, we did launch our Maytag pet line, laundry line, which, really, what it does is it adds a filter in that you can just rinse out when you're done, but it collects pet hair. And I think that's one of the things we've seen consumers most excited about. Because if you think about during the pandemic, a lot of people went out and added a new fuzzy family member or two to their household, and now, they're going through the issues of having dog hair or pet hair everywhere. So that's one of the things that we've been very excited about this year.We continue to be excited with the dishwasher that we launched in the last couple of years that has the usable third-- or the third rack that has fully functioning wash system on it. So, those are just some of the examples of some of the products that we are excited about right now. But within any given year, we typically launch over 100 new products between both our major domestic appliance line as well as our KitchenAid countertop line.So, I would say, that just on a regular basis, if you think about that, that's about 25 products every quarter. There's a lot to be excited about.- Jim, are you trying to say here that one should not take their furry puppy coats and putting them in the washing machine? What do you do with Sparky's clothing? What do you do with it?JULIE HYMAN: Sparky doesn't wear a lot of clothing, but he's a shedder. So, like, if I could throw his doggie bed in the washer and have the pet hair filter, that would be helpful.- Every day-- every day is eye opening. Let's leave it there. Jim Peters, Vice-- Executive Vice President and CFO of Whirlpool Corporation. Always great to get some time with you. Appreciate it.JIM PETERS: Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Have a good day.- You as well.]"

However, the company’s top and bottom lines declined year over year. Results were impacted by the global demand softness and unfavorable price/mix, offset by cost take-out actions.However, we note that the company’s sales and earnings improved on a sequential basis, owing to seasonality gains.We note that shares of Whirlpool declined 1% in the afterhours trading session on Jul 24. This is likely to have resulted from the soft sales performance in the second quarter, driven by soft industry demand trends. Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have gained 16.9% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 15.8% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Q2 DetailsThe appliance maker reported second-quarter adjusted earnings of $4.21 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.80. However, the bottom line declined 29.5% from the $5.97 reported in the year-ago quarter. Nonetheless, earnings per share reflected sequential growth of 58.3%, thanks to sequential improvement in the ongoing EBIT margin.Net sales of $4,792 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,896 million. The top line dropped 6% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange, net sales amounted to $4,813 million, down 5.6% year over year.The decline was mainly the result of the normalization of the promotional environment close to the pandemic levels, which was absent in the first half of 2022. However, sales partly benefited from market share growth and the inclusion of InSinkErator. On a sequential basis, sales improved 3.1% due to seasonality gains.Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseWhirlpool Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteThe gross profit for second-quarter 2023 was $816 million, down 9% from the $897 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Ongoing EBIT of $352 million declined 23.6% from $461 million in the year-ago quarter.

On a sequential basis, ongoing EBIT rose 40.2%, with the ongoing EBIT margin expanding 200 bps to 7.3%.In the quarter, the company’s cost take-out actions delivered a $150-million benefit on a year-over-year basis, driven by negating significant cost inflation from 2021 and 2022. Moreover, the company’s portfolio transformation initiatives, targeting a higher-growth, higher-margin business, remain on track. It is poised to reap gains from the housing-driven demand recovery, as it now has eight of the top 10 national builders as its trade customers.Story continuesRegional PerformancesNet sales for the North America segment decreased 4.7% year over year but improved 2.8% sequentially to $2,824 million. Excluding currency, net sales declined 4.4% year over year, driven by adverse price/mix, offset by market share gains and the integration of InSinkErator. The segment’s EBIT plunged 30.5% year over year to $290 million, while the EBIT margin contracted 380 bps to 10.3% due to unfavorable price/mix, partially offset by InSinkErator integration and cost take out actions.

Organic sales in the region dipped 11.8% on soft demand trends in Europe, partly negated by favorable price/mix. The segment’s EBIT of $17 million improved significantly from the $2 million reported in the prior-year quarter and $5 million in first-quarter 2023. The EBIT margin of 2% reflected significant growth from the 0.2% reported in the prior-year quarter, mainly benefiting from cost take out actions and assets held for sale.Net sales from Latin America rose 4.1% year over year and 8.2% sequentially to $819 million. Excluding currency, the segment’s sales rose 4.6% year over year due to market share gains and favorable demand trends in Mexico.

Excluding the currency impacts, sales for the region were down 8% mainly as market share gains were offset by soft demand trends. The segment’s EBIT of $11 million reflected a 52.2% plunge from the $23 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The segment’s EBIT margin of 3.7% contracted 310 bps from the prior-year quarter due to the adverse price/mix, partly negated by cost take out actions.

The appliance company reported sales fell 6 percent from the year prior to $4.7 billion due to a pullback in demand for its products. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the numbers.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: On a related note, painting your house, maybe you're buying some new appliances. Whirlpool, though, seeing a pullback in demand for its products in the quarter. The company posted mixed results for the second quarter. Sales were down 6% from the year prior to $4.7 billion. And those shares are down about 4.3%.So it just, sort of, emphasizes that it is not a homogeneous view here when you look at what the-- consumer demand is lumpy, is what I'm trying to say, depending on what you're talking about.- $800 for a Whirlpool front-loading washer. I think that sounds about right.JULIE HYMAN: $800 sounds like a good deal.- Pretty good. Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: Well, but that's part of the problem, that they're now promotions again. For a long time, you could not get any kind of discount on any kind of appliance.- Nope.JULIE HYMAN: As Whirlpool has pointed out, the discounts are back, and that's not great for the company. So this is a company that is experiencing margin pressure, unlike some of the others we've been talking about because it doesn't necessarily have that pricing power. It's leaning into more expensive washers and other appliances to get that margin back.- Red flag real quickly. In this report, it's Europe. I asked Gabriela Santos from JP Morgan about this. Should investors care about what looks to be a new leg down in European growth. We had those PMIs weak. Whirlpool Europe very, very weak quarter here. So lots of digging, too, with that report.JULIE HYMAN: Fun fact. The stuff they sell in Europe, or just appliances in general in Europe, much more efficient--- Really?JULIE HYMAN: --than what you can get in the US. Yeah. And yet, the little combo washer-dryer that you put in your apartment, it's not on top of each other, it's the same machine.Story continues- That's kind of cool.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. That's cool.

However, earnings and Homebuilding revenues declined 39% and 0.6% on a year-over-year basis.Meritage Homes’ earnings topped the consensus mark in 19 of the trailing 20 quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2023 earnings per share has increased to $3.49 from $3.47 over the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates a 48.5% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported value.Meritage Homes Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMeritage Homes Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMeritage Homes Corporation price-eps-surprise | Meritage Homes Corporation QuoteFor Homebuilding revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $1.31 billion, suggesting a decline of 7.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Key Factors to NoteRevenuesMeritage Homes’ Homebuilding revenues (accounted for 99.6% of total revenues in 2022) are expected to have declined in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis due to slow housing demand driven by high mortgage rates.Also, Financial Services’ revenues (accounted for 0.4% of total revenues in 2022) are anticipated to have declined from the last year quarter’s level. However, the company’s strategic shift to a pure-play entry-level and first-move-up builder are likely to have aided it to partially overcome the ongoing economic uncertainties.Segment-wise, for second-quarter 2023, our model predicts Homebuilding and Financial services revenues to decline 8.6% to $1.29 billion and 11.7% to $4.5 million, respectively, year over year.Although Homebuilding revenues are expected to have been lower on a year-over-year basis, MTH is expected to generate sequentially higher revenues, given the lack of existing homes for sale.Owing to the soft housing demand scenario, driven by persisting economic challenges, the company expects home closing to range within 2,800-3,100 units in the to-be-reported-quarter, down from the previous year’s reported value of 3,221 units. Also, home closing revenues are anticipated to be within $1.22 -$1.36 billion, down from prior year’s reported value of $1.41 billion.We expect home closing units and revenues to decrease 8.8% to 2,937 units and 8.8% to $1.29 billion, respectively, year over year. However, we expect land closing revenues to increase 64% to $5.6 million.Geographically, we expect home closing average selling price (ASP) in West and Central regions to increase year over year by 1.4% to $533,100 and 1.4% to $408,510, respectively. On the other hand, home closing ASP in the East region is anticipated to decline 2.2% to $392,150, year over year.MarginsFor the second quarter, earnings of MTH are likely to have been affected by the ongoing inflationary pressure, lower revenues, increased fuel and equipment costs, high labor expenses and insurance costs. These costs are expected to have had a negative impact on the company’s operations as well as hurt margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Owing to the aforementioned headwinds, the company expects diluted earnings per share to be within $3.15-$3.65, down from last year quarter’s reported value of $6.77 per share. Furthermore, the company expects home closing gross margin to be around 22%, reflecting a decline from prior year’s value of 31.6%.We expect home closing gross margin to decline 940 basis points to 22.2%, year over year.Backlogs and Home OrdersOwing to the aforementioned economic uncertainties, for second-quarter 2023, we expect total backlog to decline 38.7% to 4,442 units as well as total backlog value to decline by 43.1% to $1.96 billion, year over year.Geographically, we expect home orders in West, Central and East regions to decline 7.8% to 991 units, 4.4% to 1,048 units and 11.2% to 1,417 units, respectively, year over year.Story continuesWhat Our Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Meritage Homes for the quarter to be reported.

QuoteFor total revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $513.3 million, suggesting a decline of 2.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $526.7 million.Let's check out the factors that are likely to have influenced the quarter.Key Factors at PlayBeazer Homes’ total revenues, which include Homebuilding revenues (accounted for 99.4% of total revenues in fiscal 2022), and Land sales and other revenues, are likely to have declined on a year-over-year basis in third-quarter fiscal 2023. Lower consumer spending due to high mortgage rates and uncertain economic environment are likely to have weighed on the results. Consumers have become more selective and price conscious, reflecting the comparatively lower spending on a year-over-year basis.For third quarter fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues is pegged at $512 million, down 2.1% while Land sales and other revenues is pegged at $3.5 million, up 1.7%, year over year.Owing to the aforementioned risks, the company expects total home closings to be approximately 1,000 units in the fiscal third quarter, down from the prior year quarter’s value of 1,043 units.BZH anticipates the average selling price (ASP) from closings to be approximately $510,000, up from $501,700 reported in the prior year period.The consensus mark for total home closings and ASP are pegged at 1,003 units and $510,000, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, the bottom line is likely to have been affected by the persisting inflation, increased incentive expenses and high costs.For the fiscal third quarter, the consensus mark for Homebuilding as well as Land sales and other gross profits are pegged at $95 million and $0.7 million, down 27.8% and 22.2%, respectively from the prior year quarter’s reported value.Furthermore, for the quarter, the consensus mark for backlog units is pegged at 1,953 units, down 35% year over year.Nonetheless, the company’s strategic operating initiatives, wage growth, moderating home prices and decreasing cycle times are likely to have offset the risks to some extent.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Beazer Homes for the quarter to be reported.

457,116d69fa-6867-38e0-8ca8-b54924978a63,CINF,2023-07-26,Analysts Estimate Mercury General (MCY) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-mercury-general-mcy-140128212.html,1690293688,STORY,"['MCY', 'CINF']","[The market expects Mercury General (MCY) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis auto insurance company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -37.1%.Revenues are expected to be $1.05 billion, up 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mercury General?For Mercury General, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mercury General will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Mercury General would post a loss of $1.15 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.52, delivering a surprise of -32.17%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Mercury General doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry, Cincinnati Financial (CINF) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.72 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +10.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.19 billion, up 10.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Cincinnati Financial has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -29.56%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cincinnati Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Operator Instructions) My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.Steven Eric WinokerThanks, Liz. Welcome to GE's Second Quarter '23 Earnings Call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO, Larry Culp; and CFO, Carolina Dybeck Happe. GE Aerospace CFO, Rahul Ghai, who will also assume the role of GE CFO in September, will join us for Q&amp;A.Some of the statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes.Over to Larry.Story continuesH. Lawrence CulpSteve, thank you, and good morning, everyone. The GE team turned in another strong quarter with double-digit growth in orders, revenue, operating profit and cash supported by services strength, robust market demand and the lean transformation within our more focused businesses. In the first half alone, earnings have now surpassed our full year 2022 results.GE Aerospace is growing rapidly as we execute on the ramp for our customers, and GE Vernova is strengthening increased spin with record orders and improving profitability at Renewable Energy and continued margin expansion at Power.Based largely on year-to-date performance and expectations for continued strength in the second half, we're raising full year guidance today. Big picture, there's a clear sense of progress, passion and purpose within our businesses. This was particularly evident to me when I was in France last month. At the Paris Air Show, GE Aerospace shared our bold vision to define flight for today, tomorrow and the future during meetings with customers, suppliers and investors. CFM's RISE demonstrator program drew a lot of excitement as it aims to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by at least 20% compared to today's most efficient engines.I also saw our GE Vernova team for our Onshore Wind and Grid operating reviews, where we discussed opportunities and challenges with equal candor and transparency. We focus on how we grow these businesses profitably by applying real lean at the point of impact to drive results. We're also seeing leans impact in our Offshore Wind facility in Saint-Nazaire, where the team has reduced cycle times to assemble the cell roofs by nearly 50% through multiple kaizens. So while it's still early, I'm encouraged by examples like this across GE Vernova.Day in, day out, we're increasingly operating as GE Aerospace and GE Vernova. Two industry leaders with large installed bases, where services represent about 70% of GE Aerospace revenue and about half of GE Vernova revenue. In addition to attractive economics, services keep us close to our customers. We understand the issues they're wrestling with and how our technology is performing, which shapes our future road maps. And with our businesses executing, we're advancing towards their launches as independent investment-grade companies next year.When I reflect on how far we've come, it always starts with the team. So a big thank you to the entire global GE team. There's a lot to be excited about as we look forward to the rest of this year.Before I turn it over to Carolina to take you through our results in detail, let me take a moment to welcome Rahul to his additional role as GE's CFO this fall. Since joining GE Aerospace last year, he has quickly become an impactful and influential member of our GE Aerospace leadership team. And so with our final spin approaching some time in early '24 and Rahul assuming the CFO job September 1, this is Carolina's last earnings call. She has been a trusted strategic partner through significant deleveraging, improving our operating results and building the financial foundation for our 3 independent companies. We're deeply grateful for her many contributions. So on behalf of the entire GE team and for me personally, Carolina, thank you.Carolina Dybeck HappeThanks, Larry. It's truly an honor to be part of GE's ambitious transformation, and I'm incredibly proud of the work this team has done to build lasting value. And a special thank you to our finest ambitious teams for their extraordinary efforts.Now turning to Slide 3, which I'll speak to on an organic basis. In the second quarter, we delivered double-digit growth across all headline metrics. Orders increased 58%, up in all segments. Equipment was up significantly led by renewables. This includes 2 large HVDC projects with Tenet and Grid and higher-margin orders at U.S. Onshore Wind.Aerospace also up with solid defense engine orders. Services was up 21% with growth in all segments, largely driven by commercial aerospace strength. Revenue increased 19%, with both equipment and services up. Also here, Aerospace led the way as leap engine deliveries nearly doubled and services growth. Renewables also grew, led by Onshore Wind and Grid with improved pricing.Adjusted margin expanded 160 basis points, driven by volume, price and productivity. This was partially offset by mix, inflation and investments. Taken together, adjusted EPS was $0.68, nearly double what we delivered last year, driven by profit growth in all segments and meaningful deleveraging. Free cash flow was $415 million, more than double what we delivered last year, driven by earnings growth. Looking at the flows. We reduced working capital from the first quarter. Given the sequential revenue growth and preparation for large second half deliveries, receivables and inventory reduce of cash. This was more than offset by progress payments and contract assets with utilization-driven billings.At both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova, we're implementing weekly cash management and already seeing some linear progress. Importantly, our first half free cash flow underscores these efforts, up $1.5 billion year-over-year. This includes $0.5 billion lower working capital than in 2022.Now a moment on corporate. Adjusted costs were up year-over-year, primarily driven by non-repeat of 2022 timing benefits. We're preparing for stand-alone cost structures, with functional headcount down 10% year-to-date. And for the year, we continue to expect expenses in the $600 million range. We also continue to simplify and strengthen the business foundations prior to the launches of GE Aerospace and GE Vernova. This quarter, we partially monetized our GE HealthCare stake. And today, we announced that we will call the remainder of the outstanding GE preferred stock in September, further simplifying our balance sheet and reducing financing costs. And we took actions to reduce our exposure to legacy liabilities. As we have disclosed for some time, our runoff Polish mortgage portfolio, Bank BPH, has been subject to ongoing litigation along with other Polish banks. We approved the adoption of a settlement program. And associated with that, we recorded a charge of $1 billion in discontinued operations. Importantly, no incremental cash contributions from GE are required in connection with the charge as the current cash balances at Bank BPH are adequate.Overall, we're very pleased with our spin progress in first half, which includes adjusted EPS up more than 3x compared to a year ago. So given the strength of GE Aerospace and the improvement at GE Vernova, for the full year, we're now expecting revenue growth in the low double-digit range, up from high single digits; $2.10 to $2.30 of adjusted EPS, up from $1.70 to $2, and that includes $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion of operating profit; and finally, we now guide for a range of $4.1 billion to $4.6 billion for free cash flow, up from $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion.And on that happy note, back to you, Larry.H. Lawrence CulpCarolina, thank you. As many of you saw at the Paris Air Show, GE Aerospace showcased industry-leading solutions for both commercial and defense across propulsion, systems and services. Our teams are delivering for customers, both in services and by growing our large young fleet of 41,000 commercial engines and 26,000 rotorcraft and combat engines.Today, we're partnering with airframers, airlines and lessors to drive stability and predictability as they ramp. For tomorrow, we're growing and optimizing our next generation of engines. This quarter, for example, our defense team signed a historic MOU with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to produce jet fighter engines for the Indian Air Force. And while our commercial business secured major deals with Riyadh Air, Jet2 and more. For the future, we're developing next-generation technologies like RISE, hybrid electrics and sustainable aviation fuels. As a result of our efforts to embed lean and empower those closest to the action, I'm seeing greater intensity, discipline and focus. For example, as we discussed in June, while supply chain and inflation challenges persist, we're using a lean tool called plan for every part to implement pull and improve delivery. Sustaining lean efforts like this helped us increase sequential engine deliveries by 35% in the second quarter, including a 40% improvement in T700 from a 25% reduction in lead times.Looking at the market, departures have almost returned to pre-COVID levels. This rapid growth was evident in our quarterly results. Orders were up 37% with strength in commercial services and defense. Revenue was up 28% with equipment growing at double the services rate. Profit improved close to $350 million or nearly 30%. Margins contracted 30 basis points organically. Volume, pricing net of inflation, productivity were offset by unfavorable mix, increased investments and the non-repeated positive contract margin adjustments last year.Once again, commercial engines and services was particularly robust with 32% revenue growth. Commercial Engines revenue grew 35% with LEAP deliveries up over 80% year-over-year and over 10% sequentially. We're on track for 1,700 LEAP deliveries this year. As expected, the LEAP spare engine deliveries ratio was higher than 2022, but we expect this to normalize in the second half, remaining roughly in line with 2022 for the full year.Commercial Services revenue also grew over 30%. Internal shop visits increased over 10%, and external spare parts were up over 40%. For the year, we now expect Commercial Engines revenue to grow mid- to high 20s and Commercial Services to grow above 20%.Defense improved this quarter, delivering significant growth. Orders more than doubled. Engine output increased with units up over 70% year-over-year. Through the first half, we delivered double-digit revenue growth, and we're on track for at least high single-digit growth this year.Looking ahead, we're constantly innovating here as well. Our XA100 is the only engine tested and ready to ensure the U.S. maintains air superiority this decade. This engine is the most cost-effective option to meet the needs of the U.S. war fighter for decades to come. We're pleased the House has recognized the importance of this program by including funding in the National Defense Authorization Act and in the House Appropriations Committee Defense Bill. We'll be closely watching the Senate as it considers legislation this week.Based on our first half strength, we're raising revenue growth to high teens to 20% and operating profit to $5.6 billion to $5.9 billion, up roughly $1 billion year-over-year at the midpoint, and we expect free cash flow to be even stronger year-over-year, in line with our increased profit expectations.Moving to GE Vernova. We continue to see long-term growth tailwinds driven by the need for more sustainable, affordable, resilient energy along with energy security. And we're encouraged by the team's progress as they use lean to strengthen operations, driving toward a significant inflection in 2024. This quarter, renewables demonstrated continued improvement. Market demand drove record orders, led by Grid with 2 more large HVDC projects. Even excluding these projects, rid orders were up over 40%. As expected, we also recognized a large U.S. offshore order, which was included in our backlog forecast at our March investor conference.Onshore wind was strong again, led by North American equipment growing more than threefold. We serve many of North America's largest developers, and the IRA incentives are helping grow orders significantly this year. Revenue grew 27% organically, driven by higher equipment deliveries across both Wind and Grid. And offshore revenue tripled year-over-year as we increased nacelle production with June, the highest month to date. Importantly, profit improved year-over-year and sequentially for the second consecutive quarter driven by price and productivity improvements, primarily at Onshore and Grid.Going deeper into each business. At Onshore, the progress continued. First, we're seeing the impact of enhancing our underwriting rigor and focusing on select markets with fewer product offerings.Second, we're driving price to manage inflation. As we've seen the past 4 quarters, equipment margins on new orders are coming in higher than current margins, especially here in the U.S. This will help drive improved profitability going forward.Next, we're improving reliability through our fleet enhancement program. And as of July, we're almost 30% complete, and we expect to be more than halfway done by year-end. Our cost rationalization continues with Onshore headcount down roughly 30% year-over-year. At offshore, we're improving on the Haliade-X learning curve in reducing cycle times to deliver for our customers as we work through our initial projects. And finally, in Grid, the top line grew double digits in all businesses with significant margin expansion from volume, price and productivity. Grid was profitable this quarter and remains on track to turn profitable for the full year.Looking ahead, we're raising our full year renewables revenue growth forecast to high single digits, and we're expecting some sequential profit improvement in the second half, driven by Onshore Wind and Grid.Turning to Power. Power continues to deliver solid results and reliable earnings and cash flow, providing critical support for future growth at GE Vernova. And at the same time, our multiyear decarbonization efforts continue. Just this month, the Province of Ontario announced we'll work together on the planning and licensing process for 3 more potential new small modular reactors there using our BWRX-300 design.Looking at the market, GE gas turbine utilization grew at a low single-digit rate this quarter. Orders grew high single digits with strength from gas power transactional services. Revenue declined slightly largely due to aeroderivative shipment timing. Services, however, continued to grow, and we had higher HA deliveries. This provides stable baseload power to the Grid now and generates future services growth. Power delivered continued profit growth and margin expansion, price, productivity and higher contractual outage volume on heavy-duty units more than offset inflation. Overall, in the first half, Power revenue grew mid-single digits organically and margins expanded, led by gas power services. For the year, we continue to expect low single-digit revenue growth. And given our second quarter performance, we now expect Power's profit to be even better versus 2022.Taken together for GE Vernova, we're raising our revenue forecast to mid-single-digit growth. We're also improving our profit guidance, driven by both renewables and power, and now expect a negative $400 million to a negative $100 million this year, an improvement of almost $800 million year-over-year at the midpoint. We continue to expect flat to slightly improved free cash flow. Overall, we're pleased with our progress and momentum but, of course, more remains to be done.So to wrap up on Slide 7. Our businesses delivered a strong half anchored by missions that matter to our customers and to the world. GE Aerospace inventing the future of flight. GE Vernova electrifying and decarbonizing the world. We're excited about where we are and where we're headed, and I'm confident we're well positioned for success as 2 innovative service-focused market leaders.Steve, with that, let's go to Q&amp;A.Steven Eric WinokerThanks, Larry. Before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Liz, please open the line.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.Sheila Karin KahyaogluI wanted to ask about Aerospace profitability. When we look at year-to-date margins for the first half, Aero margins are 18.9% and the full year implied guidance is $18.5%. So what are the dynamics of contraction in the second half given the commentary in the release prior was -- the commentary in your release is good market strength, efficiencies are coming through, you've shipped 46% of the lease in H1, slightly ahead of your prior expectation of sequential improvement for the year? So what happens that margins contract in the second half?H. Lawrence CulpSheila, thank you. No, you're spot on. And I think as we referenced, there is largely a mix dynamic in play as equipment revenues begin to accelerate here, vis-à-vis, services. But I think that's an excellent question for Rahul to jump in on here. It's one of the reasons we wanted to have him here with us this morning. Rahul?Rahul GhaiYes. Thanks, Larry. So first, let me just go back to how good the second quarter was, which you referenced. We had 28% organic growth; commercial engine is up more than 50%; service continuing a really strong run with 30%-plus growth; Defense recovering, as Larry said in his remarks, to be up double-digit on revenue growth for the first half; and profit was up more than 30% year-over-year with margin expansion. And the quarter was better than what we had expected going back all the way to April. So -- but more importantly, as we look to the quarter, it gave us the confidence to raise the full year, and our profit is up $1 billion for the year at the midpoint of the guide with year-over-year margin expansion. So that's a positive change as well.And relative to April, we're raising the full year profit by about $250 million at the midpoint of the guide with about $400 million of revenue increase. So that's about a 60% incremental drop-through. And that is happening even though most of the revenue increase in our guide is coming from commercial OE as we are raising the commercial OE outlook from approximately 20 to mid- to high 20s. So the business is doing better on execution, and the improvement in the spare parts growth is helping as well.Now to your question on the sequential view between first half and second half. The key driver of the sequential growth is commercial from -- is coming from commercial OE, which is up probably 60% between first half, second half. And that's a reversal of what we saw last year. Last year, most of the first half to second half growth was coming from commercial services. And within commercial OE, there is a spare install dynamic happening as well with installs being as a percentage of total shipments increasing as we get into the second half of the year. So that's why you're seeing a sequential step-down in margin. But again, it's going to be a really good year. We're going to expand margins and grow profit about $1 billion for the year.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.Andrew Burris ObinI'll stay in the Power lane, given that there are more illustrious analysts now covering the stock. Offshore, interestingly, you noted favorable year-over-year orders in offshore, and I thought the commentary was that you were not looking at offshore orders. And also if you could comment on the industry dynamic because it seems that folks are pulling out of offshore as the overall pricing dynamic is not favorable. So people are pulling away from contracts. So more color on offshore would be great. And great quarter.H. Lawrence CulpThank you, Andrew. You're illustrious in our eyes, rest reassured. I would say with respect to the offshore orders, again, that was something that we knew we had coming. There were just some details that we needed to lock down, and we were pleased to do that, but really no surprise from what we shared with you out in Cincinnati in March in that regard. I think for us, we're still building out this Offshore business we referenced what we're doing in terms of production in Saint-Nazaire to begin to flow this backlog, this nascent backlog that we have. We certainly have read and have had direct discussions with a number of customers on both sides of the Atlantic as they prepare for the next decade.I think we're optimistic about Offshore Wind. I know there was some press over the course of the weekend that talk to some of the potential delays. But at the end of the day, as we think about the energy transition, we think about various ways in which, certainly, the coasts are going to be powered with renewable sources. Offshore has a role to play there. I think what we want to do is build up a business that has a respectable, profitable slice of that market.Really pleased with the progress we're making in Onshore. I think everything that we said a year ago is playing out in terms of our selectivity, the improvement in the quality of the backlog from a pricing and from a cost perspective. I think the team here, we've talked often about how they're going to run the Power playbook. They've done a really nice job, making sure that we are working through some of the quality issues that triggered the charge that we took in the third quarter of last year. And again, our cost base is 30% better than it was just 12 months ago. So you put that together, you can really see the churn in Onshore. And Grid, we don't talk a lot about Grid, but really pleased with similar execution against a backdrop where I think maybe more so in Europe, but increasingly here in the U.S. people appreciate how critical grid modernization will be to the energy transition. So we've got 3, as they say in Aerospace, angles of attack in renewables. Gas continuing to play a vital role. So we like the way that we're positioned Offshore Wind being 1 play amongst many at GE Vernova.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.Seth Michael SeifmanSo I wanted to ask with regard to the margin rate for Aerospace in the second half, if you could talk a little bit about what role you expect pricing to play there and the extent to which it can offset the mix headwinds.And then maybe just a technical question. I think you talked about really strong growth in spare parts. And just when we try to think about this and model it going forward, I think if I look in the Q, it's like a low single-digit growth in the spares rate per day, but I think spares were up something like 40% in the quarter. So just kind of how to square those things and how we can kind of measure that and think about it going forward.Rahul GhaiSo let me start with the first question on pricing debt. So again, I think the price continues to be a positive driver in terms of earnings growth across both defense and commercial. And we are price/cost positive both in the quarter and expect to be price/cost positive for the year. So the trends continue to be good, and that is similar to what we saw last year. So really no change in terms of how we are driving incremental pricing to cover the inflation that we are feeling in the business. Now in terms of our spare parts sales, yes, the spare parts sales, you're right. I mean it was really good growth in the quarter, more than 40%. And I would say 3 large drivers of the spare parts growth. First, the price increases that we just spoke about. But it's just not the increases, it's also the discipline with which we are driving the business so that we're making sure that we are extracting the most out of the price increases that we are putting in place.The second was the customer mix was favorable as well. So that helped drive spare parts sales. And the third, I would say, is if you go to back to 2022, China was really weak last year, especially in the second and the third quarters because of the shutdowns in China. So the year-over-year growth trends were helped by a weak compare in the second quarter in China. Now that dynamic is going to shift a little bit as we get into the second half of the year because, if you recall, China came back really strongly in the fourth quarter to get ready for the reopening in first quarter. So that's going to impact our spare parts growth in the second half of the year on a year-over-year basis. So overall, I think we're really pleased with how spare parts are trending. Good growth in the quarter and expect continued growth in the second half of the year on a year-over-year basis although at a slower rate.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.Julian C.H. MitchellMaybe I just wanted to focus on the Renewables business because I guess you had a very strong revenue uplift, but the sort of incrementals perhaps if we're looking sequentially or year-on-year were not particularly strong. So maybe help us kind of parse that out in terms of maybe it's offshore losses getting a lot wider, and that's offsetting better incrementals, maybe at Onshore and Grid. Maybe just talk through some of those dynamics.And then as we're thinking about the second half for Renewables and the sort of entry rates into 2024, how do we think about the losses narrowing? Is it sort of linear or there's a step function some time next year because of offshore mix or something?H. Lawrence CulpJulian, let me frame that for you. I think you've got the contours exactly right. Again, I think that in 2023, what we've said all along is that what we really need to see is that sequential improvement in Onshore Wind. And that was really, if you will, the battleground for us this year as we get ready to have Vernova go sometime early next year.And I think all in all, we saw that sequential improvement, again, a function of a better backlog being shipped from a pricing, from a terms and conditions perspective. Some of that's a function of our selectivity. Some of that's a function of just improved market conditions. We know we are delivering a higher-quality product to customers today. That's reflected in our cost performance, let alone the restructuring that has been underway there. And that really continues.And I'd also suggest that beyond what you see in those numbers, what I see in our operating reviews really gives me confidence that the team is running this business than we would want them to run it, and that bodes well both for the back half improvements that are part of the guide here, but also getting us ready for next year.Again, a similar rollout in Grid. We've been at -- we've been running the Power playbook there for the last couple of years and having them turn profitable, not that that's the goal. We want to be a strong contributor here. I think it's another proof point of progress. You're right, Offshore Wind does begin to negate some of that progress as that mix effect takes a hold with the uptick in Offshore revenues improving and thus, the revenue recognition and the losses there as we work through that initial backlog.But we knew that was part of the start-up of Offshore Wind. So we see sequential progress. It's muted a bit perhaps in your eyes because of the Offshore effect. I mean, Offshore was roughly half of the loss in the second quarter. But given the progress in Onshore Wind, given the progress in Grid, given what we know we're going to be able to do an Offshore Wind next year, we feel very good about the progress and the momentum that we're making at Vernova or at renewables at large.Rahul GhaiSo just to add into what Larry just said. So if you look at Vernova, we are raising both the revenue and the profit guidance for the year. About $150 million of the profit raises from midpoint, and it's coming both with power and renewables contributing to the rate. About 1/3 of that is from the second quarter performance in Power driven by the strength of the Services business, and about 2/3 from Renewables in the second half of 2023 with the improvement in both Onshore and Grid. Onshore mainly because of the backlog margins improving and in Grid from volume and productivity. So good progress in both businesses year-over-year and on a sequential basis.OperatorOur next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.Robert Michael SpingarnLarry, maybe on the product development side, perhaps a little high level. But Airbus has said that an A220-500 is a matter of when and not if. And they've also openly talked about the desire to add a second engine to the family. And so given that, that aircraft would directly compete against the MAX 8, do you feel the need to get the LEAP-1B on to the A220 family?H. Lawrence CulpRob, I thought your multi-series coverage on that specific topic and how the 2 airframers are going to play out their narrow-body product strategy here really captured well the critical questions that we're all wrestling with. As you probably can respect, we're in deep with both of our airframer customers relative to our own product road map and technology road map for that matter, i.e., RISE, and how we can work together as they evolve their own product strategy. So specifically to the A220-500, I think we'll keep our comments private. We'll have that conversation with Guillaume and his team. But obviously, as we evolve our product portfolio, we want to be on all the critical platforms that matter in the decades ahead.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.Deane Michael DrayFirst of all, thank you to Carolina and wish you all the best.Carolina Dybeck HappeThank you, Deane.Deane Michael DrayLarry, I know you talked about the renewable orders that were booked in terms of profitability. But can you generalize a bit and talk about the range of customer modifications within these orders that were booked that had been a problem before, too much variability versus steering customers to a more standardized offering? Does that readout in these orders?H. Lawrence CulpDeane, we should have mentioned that earlier. Thanks for asking about that. Part of what we've tried to do in addition to our selectivity effort in terms of the types of opportunities that we pursue is also make sure that, frankly, we are driving more standardized offerings. I would say that we are seeing probably more in the order book than in the P&amp;L today the positive effect of that.I'd also say coupled with that is just, frankly, a more conservative forward estimation of cost. And that will play out over time. We'll see how conservative those estimates are. But I know that the team for the last several quarters is really not that too far into the future vis-à-vis the cost position that we anticipate having when we deliver on this growing backlog.So you put all that together in addition to the quality improvements that we put across the sharply reduced cost structure that we have in the business. I think that's why we've got, particularly in Onshore Wind, the optimism we do about the back half and profitability in 2024.OperatorOur next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.Jeffrey Todd SpragueJust a follow-up on renewables maybe. Just love to get your thoughts on the trajectory of free cash flow. I'm kind of stuck with the same language, right, flat to improving. But I'm wondering if inside that, given the better trajectory of profitability apparently and what looks like some decent orders that should be coming with deposits attached if in fact the free cash flow outlook for renewables has improved for the year and if you have anything to share about how you view 2024 playing out.Rahul GhaiSo let me start, Jeff, with 2023 first. So on renewables for full year, in the current construct, what you'll find is kind of flattish to last year, $150-ish million positive from earnings, right, with huge growth in earnings minus the charge that we took last year and good progress on Onshore Wind here, especially with the progress payments. Grid's doing well, but it's coming -- it's getting offset by the offshore from absence of progress payments and the way the contract assets are playing out. So overall, renewables, think of that as kind of flat year-over-year for full year. And then if you go to Power, the fact is Power free cash could be slightly down year-over-year. Again, positive earnings from cash, but it's getting pressured with these contract assets because as the revenue growth happens, we burn through the contract assets that are sitting on our books because the revenue exceeds the billings. So that's what's happening on the Power side. So it's good for the business. The revenue growth is happening. The outages are helping. It's driving good revenue growth, but has a temporary negative impact on free cash. Now obviously, as we get into 2024, we'll provide more guidance as we get towards the end of the year into next year, but we do expect strong sequential improvement year-over-year in Vernova business overall.OperatorOur next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.Nigel Edward CoeSo just wondered if maybe we could just dive into maybe 3Q and look at some of the moving pieces for both earnings and free cash flow. And on top of that, just this $1 billion charge on the Polish Bank, is that just writing down the remaining net asset value in that business, no cash? And does that clean up litigation there?Rahul GhaiYes. So on Poland, Nigel, I didn't fully follow your third quarter question, so let's come back to that. But let me start with Poland. So we've been working to simplify the legacy liabilities, and it's a meaningful step forward in that direction prior to spin. We are approving a settlement program, and that significantly reduces our exposure to future losses. And as Carolina said in her prepared remarks, there's no incremental GE cash from taking this reserve as the bank has adequate cash balances. So we feel good to get this as much as we can behind us. Obviously, the situation is evolving. But at this point, it's a really good step forward as we clean up and simplify all the legacy liabilities.Nigel Edward CoeAnd the 3Q question was just guide, just how are we thinking about 3Q guidance overall.Rahul GhaiYes. So on third quarter, expect high single-digit revenue growth in the quarter and then EPS range of about $0.45 to $0.55 with sequential profit growth in both Aerospace and in Renewables. And we will see a pretty strong growth in Power in the third quarter on profit, and expect the margins to go up 3 to 4 points on Power. And if you look at the EPS that we're providing, the range that we're providing of $0.45 to $0.55, that's about 2x what we did last year even if we exclude the charge. So it's a significant improvement from that.And for Aerospace, going back all the way to prior questions, profit will be up sequentially, but the margin rates could be down slightly given the majority of the first half to second half increase is coming from commercial OE. And then Renewables will continue to see sequential improvements, given Onshore Wind and Grid performance. And then as I said, Power, given the outage activity in the third quarter, we do expect good improvement there and free cash. And the free cash kind of flat to up slightly in the quarter with earnings growth and working capital reduction offsetting the D&amp;A headwind.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.Andrew Alec KaplowitzCarolina, thanks for your help.Carolina Dybeck HappeAndrew, thank you.Andrew Alec KaplowitzCould you give us a little more color into the improvement you're seeing in your Defense business? You talked about orders more than doubling. Revenue was up 31%. Has Defense growth and profitability really turned the corner for you guys? And how do we think about its contribution to growth and margin over next couple of quarters and into '24? I know you said that you expect at least high single-digit growth for Defense, but does GE Defense now have an extended runway for growth?H. Lawrence CulpAndy, maybe I'll start. As we indicated in our prepared remarks, and I think we have through the last several quarters, demand is not our fundamental challenge in the Defense arena, throughput is. And the supply chain challenges that we've talked about and everyone talks about certainly applied to Defense. I think we've had some particular issues that have challenged us, especially so with the first quarter numbers. I think we're really encouraged by what we have seen recently, not only with the T700, but with a host of platforms where our material flow in our own facilities is better. We are improving yields in a number of key operations that allows that flow to take place. And we talked a little bit about PFEP, a plan for every part, how that helps us implement pull and turn improved deliveries. So our signals to not only our internal supply base, but also our external supply base are better and more clear. We're not just trying to work against past due, but really targeting what we need when we need it. And that has, in turn, I think had some early impact here. And to the extent that we're able to do that, do that productively, and we've certainly seen, I think, improvements not only in traditional material price cost, but also beginning to see some labor productivity improvements, all of that accrues to our good. But as long as we're able to continue to drive this output level, we'll see that high single-digit top line number and, in turn, the goodness that will follow out from a margin and from a cash perspective. Rahul, anything you'd add there?Rahul GhaiNo, Larry, I think you covered it. I think it's good to see the recovery happening in the second half -- in the second quarter kind of puts us back on track for the full year. And we're seeing good demand and good improvement in year-over-year delivery. So we expect a good half in the back half of the year.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.Joseph Alfred RitchieCarolina, thank you for all the help throughout the years.Carolina Dybeck HappeThank you. Thank you.Joseph Alfred RitchieSo really my question -- well, congrats on all the progress you're making, staying at the balance sheet with the pref redemption, the Polish mortgage announcement today. I'm just curious from this point forward, how are you thinking about capital allocation pre-spend? And then any color that you can give us on just the progress of the spend? I know you said early 2024, but just any other hurdles that you see from here to there.H. Lawrence CulpJoe, I would say that there really isn't any change in our perspective this morning with respect to the spend and the capital allocation decisions that we'll take between now and then. We've talked about Vernova launching sometime early next year. That is still very much the case today. We've talked about that really being a function of their performance, not necessarily our readiness, because the teams that are focused on the separation work had, I think, real success with HealthCare, are rerunning that playbook here and are exactly where we would want to be in the middle of July.So as we look forward, again, I think we're really encouraged by what we have seen in the first half results and in the second half outlook. Still work to do, right? There's a negative operating loss there that none of us feel great about. But I think what we've said is the way we'll define winning is sequential improvement business by business. And what we've seen in Onshore and Grid, I think we can all be quite proud of.With respect to capital allocation, job 1 remains a successful standup of all 3 of these companies. And while you've seen us continue to make progress on some of the specific initiatives like the monetization of the AerCap stake, likewise with HealthCare, you mentioned the preps, thank you, even the -- well, just you put all that together, we're very much going to be in position from a balance sheet perspective to not only launch but then allow each of the respective Boards at Aerospace and Vernova to shape the contours of a capital allocation policy fit for each business. So that may be a little boring perhaps here in the near term, but this team is hyper focused on what our overarching priority is over the next several quarters, and that is the successful spin of GE Vernova and successful standup of GE Aerospace.Steven Eric WinokerLiz, we have time for one last quick question.OperatorThis question will come from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.Christopher M. SnyderI appreciate the time. So I want to ask on renewables. Revenue was up 12% in the first half of the year. And with the full year guidance calling for high single-digit revenue growth, it's I guess implying like a fall down to low singles in the back half of the year. Can you just maybe talk about what's driving that? Because it doesn't seem to jive with orders up well over 100% for the first half.Rahul GhaiSo the orders don't help much this year, Chris. I mean, that's mainly -- those revenues, those orders will kind of play out over '24 and even '25. So -- and what you see between the first half growth and the second half growth is just basically project timing. It's just a question of which projects are getting executed and how those projects play out. So -- but again, it's good progress, feel better about the year, raising guidance on renewables, on revenue growth. So it's good progress. And the orders that we -- and the orders are obviously very, very strong, and that helps '24 and '25.Steven Eric WinokerThanks, Rahul. Larry, any final comment?H. Lawrence CulpSteve, thank you. No, I would say simply to close a strong first half in 2023. And frankly, I've never been more confident in our path ahead as we prepare to launch both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova. Thanks everybody for your time today and your investment and support of our company.OperatorThank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

This was despite earnings dipping -13% from a tougher to-compete-against prior year quarter with Q2 sales down -13% from a year ago as well.  Still, the better-than-expected Q2 results are driving GE shares higher with General Electric highlighting robust services growth across its portfolio including increased demand at GE Aerospace and record Renewable Energy orders.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSetting the Tone At the moment General Electric stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has set the tone for other Zacks Diversified Operations Industry stocks. Notably, this industry is in the top 42% of over 250 Zacks industries and boasts several top-rated stocks.To that point, Honeywell International (HON) and Griffon Corporation (GFF) sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and are two companies’ investors will certainly want to watch ahead of their quarterly reports on Thursday, July 27.    Honeywell Q2 Preview: Like General Electric, Honeywell has an iconic brand among industrial appliances along with a strong presence in aerospace that includes commercial aviation and defense.Honeywell’s Q2 earnings are anticipated to rise 5% from a year ago at $2.20 per share with sales forecasted to be up 2% to $9.17 billion. More impressive, Honeywell has topped earnings expectations for a very astonishing 25 consecutive quarters most recently beating Q1 EPS estimates by 7%.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGriffon Q3 Preview: Anticipation is high for Griffon’s fiscal third-quarter results after the diversified management company crushed its Q2 earnings expectations by 78% in May. Griffon’s Home &amp; Building Products segment may continue to give the company a boost although Q3 earnings are expected to be down -19% at $0.99 per share following a tough to-compete quarter that saw EPS at $1.23. Third-quarter sales are expected to slightly dip by -2% to $752 million.Story continuesWith that being said, General Electric's earnings beat has only lifted optimism for Griffon’s results with shares of GFF standing out in terms of value and the company’s  growth has been stellar in recent years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings Estimate RevisionsRising earnings estimates make Honeywell and Griffon stock attractive at the moment and are an indication of more short-term upside. This largely attributes to their Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as fiscal 2023 and FY24 earnings estimates have trended higher.Honeywell’s annual earnings are now expected to be up 4% this year and rise another 9% in FY24 at $10.04 per share, Plus, earnings estimates have remained higher throughout the quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLooking at Griffon, following a very stellar year earnings are expected to dip -3% in FY23 but rebound and rise 1% in FY24 at $4.02 per share. More reassuring is that earnings estimates are nicely up over the last 60 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs for General Electric, its stock is worth holding as annual earnings are expected to be down -22% this year but rebound and soar 92% in FY24 at $3.89 per share. However, FY24 earnings estimates are modestly lower compared to 90 days ago but could start rising after the company’s strong Q2 results.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line Opportunity is brewing among the Zacks Diversified Operations Industry with many of these stocks standing out before their quarterly reports and General Electric's results set the tone.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group UnitedHealth Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President &amp; COO, Dirk McMahon, sold US$8.0m worth of shares at a price of US$543 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$511. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In the last year UnitedHealth Group insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.UnitedHealth Group Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of UnitedHealth Group shares. In total, CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director Andrew Witty dumped US$5.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of UnitedHealth GroupLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. UnitedHealth Group insiders own about US$1.6b worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About UnitedHealth Group Insiders?An insider sold UnitedHealth Group shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But since UnitedHealth Group is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example - UnitedHealth Group has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Of course UnitedHealth Group may not be the best stock to buy.

This compares to FFO of $0.28 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 3.85%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.26 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.25, delivering a surprise of -3.85%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates just once.Retail Opportunity Investments , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry, posted revenues of $82.04 million for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.15%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $78.23 million.

One of the world's major purchasers of pulp for consumer goods, the Cincinnati-based purveyor of Charmin toilet paper, Bounty paper towels and Puffs tissues, buys the wood product from suppliers in Latin America, Europe, Canada and the U.S., according to data on its website.""In an era where companies are moving forward on climate risk,"" the change marks a ""step backward,"" Leslie Samuelrich, the president of P&amp;G investor Green Century Funds, told Reuters.Green Century, with more than $1.1 billion in assets under management, counted P&amp;G as among its largest holdings as of March 31, and led a shareholder proposal on the company's forestry practices in 2020.P&amp;G in May updated its Forest Commodities Policy, removing language in a previous environmental pledge, made in 2021, that said it would not permit forest degradation -- that is, activities that significantly harm drinking water, animal habitats or other important elements of forests.Its new forestry policy could put it at odds with a European Union deforestation law coming into effect in about 18 months banning certain goods linked to deforestation and forest degradation. P&amp;G said it will comply with the upcoming requirements.""P&amp;G recently streamlined"" its policies for forestry commodities like pulp after the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization ""acknowledged that a widely applied definition of forest degradation is unavailable,"" said Jack McAneny, P&amp;G vice president for global sustainability, during the virtual briefing July 18.BNP Paribas Asset Management, one of the company's significant shareholders, asked why the no-degradation pledge was removed and what the implications are for P&amp;G's sourcing practices during the briefing, according to a source who was at the meeting.Story continues""In light of these evolving definitions, as we consolidated our policies, we simplified the language,"" McAneny said. ""Our ongoing efforts to keep forests as forests while continuing to serve consumers with superior-performing products, all of those efforts remain unchanged.""But three environmental non-governmental organizations and three investors told Reuters that they believe there is broad agreement on what ""forest degradation"" is and what causes it, such as clear-cut logging in pristine forests. The Natural Resources Defense Council has said P&amp;G's wood pulp supply chain seems to degrade forests.Tonia Elrod, P&amp;G's vice president for family care, which includes its towel and tissue products, said in a statement the company has a policy against deforestation and ""rigorous compliance mechanisms in place.""For every tree we use in our paper products, at least two are regrown,"" Elrod said.THREATS TO ECOSYSTEMSEnvironmental non-profits and some shareholders have increased scrutiny on P&amp;G's sustainability policies since 2020 when a majority of its investors passed a non-binding resolution requesting that it assess how it could bolster efforts to eliminate deforestation and forest degradation in its supply chains.In its new forestry policy, P&amp;G, which also makes Tide detergent and Dawn dish soap, consolidates existing guidelines for paper packaging and palm oil, used throughout its portfolio of products.Investors and environmental advocates, however, are pushing back. Gaurav Madan, a forests and land campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said the company's explanation for the change is ""insufficient.""The environmental advocacy group is working on drafting an open letter to investors calling attention to the changed policy, Madan said. It plans to reach out to big shareholders including BlackRock, State Street, UBS and Legal &amp; General, who have followed environmental concerns with the company's forestry policy and pulp supply chain in the past, he said.Most environmental groups agree that forest degradation leads to a loss of value in an ecosystem, such as the elimination of habitats for a threatened species, said Shelley Vinyard, a campaign director at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).The NRDC late last year filed a complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to evaluate if P&amp;G's claims that it prohibits forest degradation were materially misleading investors. The NRDC said that P&amp;G's claim that it prohibits environmental degradation is ""implausible"" based on evidence from the company's disclosures about buying pulp from certain forests and from areas overlapping with habitat for caribou.The SEC had reached out to NRDC about its complaint, Vinyard said, and the environmental advocacy group gave a presentation to the regulator on the complaint this May, according to slides viewed by Reuters, where it explained the differences between deforestation and degradation.The SEC did not immediately return a request for comment.Peter van der Werf, head of engagement at Robeco, which had a $375 million stake in P&amp;G at March 31, said he expects the company to ""mitigate the negative impact of their business operations on climate change and biodiversity loss.""(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York; Editing by Aurora Ellis)]"

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) shareholders have enjoyed a 91% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 55% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 8.4% in the last year , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Procter &amp; Gamble achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 9.1% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Procter &amp; Gamble has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Procter &amp; Gamble the TSR over the last 5 years was 117%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveProcter &amp; Gamble shareholders gained a total return of 8.4% during the year. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 17% a year, over half a decade) look better. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Procter &amp; Gamble better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Procter &amp; Gamble .Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

One of the world's major purchasers of pulp for consumer goods, the Cincinnati-based purveyor of Charmin toilet paper, Bounty paper towels and Puffs tissues, buys the wood product from suppliers in Latin America, Europe, Canada and the U.S., according to data on its website.""In an era where companies are moving forward on climate risk,"" the change marks a ""step backward,"" Leslie Samuelrich, the president of P&amp;G investor Green Century Funds, told Reuters.Green Century, with more than $1.1 billion in assets under management, counted P&amp;G as among its largest holdings as of March 31, and led a shareholder proposal on the company's forestry practices in 2020. P&amp;G in May updated its Forest Commodities Policy, removing language in a previous environmental pledge, made in 2021, that said it would not permit forest degradation -- that is, activities that significantly harm drinking water, animal habitats or other important elements of forests.Its new forestry policy could put it at odds with a European Union deforestation law coming into effect in about 18 months banning certain goods linked to deforestation and forest degradation. P&amp;G said it will comply with the upcoming requirements.""P&amp;G recently streamlined"" its policies for forestry commodities like pulp after the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization ""acknowledged that a widely applied definition of forest degradation is unavailable,"" said Jack McAneny, P&amp;G vice president for global sustainability, during the virtual briefing July 18.BNP Paribas Asset Management, one of the company's significant shareholders, asked why the no-degradation pledge was removed and what the implications are for P&amp;G's sourcing practices during the briefing, according to a source who was at the meeting.Story continues""In light of these evolving definitions, as we consolidated our policies, we simplified the language,"" McAneny said. ""Our ongoing efforts to keep forests as forests while continuing to serve consumers with superior-performing products, all of those efforts remain unchanged.""But three environmental non-governmental organizations and three investors told Reuters that they believe there is broad agreement on what ""forest degradation"" is and what causes it, such as clear-cut logging in pristine forests. The Natural Resources Defense Council has said P&amp;G's wood pulp supply chain seems to degrade forests.Tonia Elrod, P&amp;G's vice president for family care, which includes its towel and tissue products, said in a statement the company has a policy against deforestation and ""rigorous compliance mechanisms in place.""For every tree we use in our paper products, at least two are regrown,"" Elrod said.THREATS TO ECOSYSTEMSEnvironmental non-profits and some shareholders have increased scrutiny on P&amp;G's sustainability policies since 2020 when a majority of its investors passed a non-binding resolution requesting that it assess how it could bolster efforts to eliminate deforestation and forest degradation in its supply chains.In its new forestry policy, P&amp;G, which also makes Tide detergent and Dawn dish soap, consolidates existing guidelines for paper packaging and palm oil, used throughout its portfolio of products.Investors and environmental advocates, however, are pushing back. Gaurav Madan, a forests and land campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said the company's explanation for the change is ""insufficient.""The environmental advocacy group is working on drafting an open letter to investors calling attention to the changed policy, Madan said. It plans to reach out to big shareholders including BlackRock, State Street, UBS and Legal &amp; General, who have followed environmental concerns with the company's forestry policy and pulp supply chain in the past, he said.Most environmental groups agree that forest degradation leads to a loss of value in an ecosystem, such as the elimination of habitats for a threatened species, said Shelley Vinyard, a campaign director at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).The NRDC late last year filed a complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to evaluate if P&amp;G's claims that it prohibits forest degradation were materially misleading investors. The NRDC said that P&amp;G's claim that it prohibits environmental degradation is ""implausible"" based on evidence from the company's disclosures about buying pulp from certain forests and from areas overlapping with habitat for caribou.The SEC had reached out to NRDC about its complaint, Vinyard said, and the environmental advocacy group gave a presentation to the regulator on the complaint this May, according to slides viewed by Reuters, where it explained the differences between deforestation and degradation.The SEC did not immediately return a request for comment.Peter van der Werf, head of engagement at Robeco, which had a $375 million stake in P&amp;G at March 31, said he expects the company to ""mitigate the negative impact of their business operations on climate change and biodiversity loss.""

The company is expected to deliver sales and earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.32 per share, indicating a 9.1% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. For fiscal fourth-quarter revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $19.93 billion, suggesting a 2.1% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.In the last reported quarter, the company recorded an earnings surprise of 3.79%. It has delivered a bottom-line beat of 1.02%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Procter &amp; Gamble Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Procter &amp; Gamble Company (The) price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Procter &amp; Gamble Company (The) QuoteKey Factors to NoteProcter &amp; Gamble has been demonstrating its dominance in the global market by strategically leveraging its brand strength to drive organic sales growth. As a manufacturer of products catering to the essential daily needs of consumers worldwide, P&amp;G's success in the preceding quarters can be attributed to its robust brand portfolio and effective business strategies. The persistence of these trends is expected to get reflected in the company’s organic sales for the fiscal fourth quarter.We expect organic sales to increase 5.2% in the to-be-reported quarter. Organic sales are expected to increase 7% for the Beauty segment, 5% for Grooming, 5% for Fabric &amp; Home Care, 8% for Health Care, and 3% for the Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segment.P&amp;G has been diligently pursuing cost-saving and productivity measures to drive margins and reinforce its competitive advantage. The company's commitment to enhancing productivity, while mitigating macro cost headwinds has been integral to maintaining a balanced top and bottom-line growth.We expect P&amp;G's gross margin for the fiscal fourth quarter to have been influenced by significant productivity savings. Our model predicts a gross margin expansion of 50 bps for the to-be-reported quarter. However, currency headwinds are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Rising input costs are expected to have weighed on the fiscal fourth-quarter performance. Our estimate indicates a 4% impact from currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company anticipated year-over-year all-in sales growth of 1% for fiscal 2023, with organic sales likely to increase 6%. The company expects currency movements to negatively impact all-in sales growth by 5%.Management predicted reported EPS to be flat to up 4% from the $5.81 posted in fiscal 2022. The company expects EPS to be at the low end of the above-mentioned range due to the ongoing commodity and material cost headwinds, and currency impacts.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Procter &amp; Gamble this time around.

To skip our detailed analysis of the global airline industry, you can go directly to 5 Most Luxurious Airlines in the World. Airline Industry Profitability OutlookThe airline industry is once again in full swing following the opening of the hospitality and travel industry. On June 5, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) upgraded its profitability outlook of the airline industry for 2023. The airline industry is witnessing high travel demand post-COVID and that is pushing the profitability outlook for the industry. Before we talk about the profitability forecast of the airline industry, let’s briefly take a look at the airline industry's profit margins. As we pointed out earlier, the airline industry has some of the lowest profit margins. This is one of the main reasons why the airline industry is unable to adjust to economic crises or downward pricing pressure, as experienced throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Between 2020 and 2022, the airline industry potentially lost around $200 billion, even the best airlines in the world had job cuts at a massive scale. Even though the airline industry had severe economic impacts during the pandemic, we are noticing a remarkable recovery in 2023. As per IATA, the total revenue is expected to grow to $803 billion in 2023, up by 9.7% year over year. The airline industry revenue will cross the $800 billion mark for the first time since 2019, which was reported at $838 billion. IATA has upgraded its profitability outlook for the airline industry to a net profit of $9.8 billion in 2023 from $4.7 billion, as per the projection in December 2022. The good thing about the industry outlook is that expense growth is expected to remain consistent with an annual increase of 8.1%. IATA’s Director General, Willie Walsh, regarding the airline industry outlook mentioned:“Airline financial performance in 2023 is beating expectations. Stronger profitability is supported by several positive developments. China lifted COVID-19 restrictions earlier in the year than anticipated. Cargo revenues remain above pre-pandemic levels even though volumes have not. And, on the cost side, there is some relief. Jet fuel prices, although still high, have moderated over the first half of the year.Economic uncertainties have not dampened the desire to travel, even as ticket prices absorbed elevated fuel costs. After deep COVID-19 losses, even a net profit margin of 1.2% is something to celebrate! But with airlines just making $2.25 per passenger on average, repairing damaged balance sheets and providing investors with sustainable returns on their capital will continue to be a challenge for many airlines.”Story continuesThe hospitality and leisure industry is reviving as the world’s urge to travel continues to increase. As per IATA, the estimated number of travelers is expected to be around 4.35 billion in 2023. The traveling demand is expected to drive an average passenger load factor of 80.9% in 2023, reaching closer to 2019’s record performance of 82.6%.Some of the busiest airline regions including North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East, should continue to maintain the rising trend in the market. North America leads the way with an expected net profit of around $11.5 billion in 2023. At the same time, Europe and the Middle East should make a net profit of $5.1 billion and $2 billion, respectively.  Airline Industry's New InitiativesTo keep up with the luxury, airline companies always try to offer top-end services in the form of business and first class flights. However, just like any other industry, airline companies need to find a way to make flights eco-friendly. On June 29, the World Economic Forum shared a report which mentions the pre-pandemic carbon emissions from the aviation industry were around 2.5% of global total emissions. The airline industry expects to achieve net-zero flying by 2050. In that premise, Europe is aiming to modernize air traffic control systems to decrease up to 10% of emissions. At the same time, the U.S. is working on a similar programme called NextGen17. As of April 2023, 25 airlines, mostly from the Americas and Europe, have initiated science-based targets to reduce CO2 emissions, according to an analysis by McKinsey. The airlines from the Americas and Europe reflect more than 30% of global passenger traffic. Many airlines around the world have committed to sustainability goals such as carbon reduction and SAF targets. The stakeholders in the aviation industry are working on defined paths to minimize emissions including the Paris Agreement and the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Some of the most efficient practices to reduce CO2 emissions is to optimize air space usage. However, the airlines need to make policies for these new initiatives based on their cost and production. The current economic state makes it difficult for airline companies to adapt to regional incentives and penalties. For instance, Europe's response to the Inflation Reduction Act could influence SAF-related decarbonization costs for the airlines operating in Europe. The President of United Airlines Venture, owned by United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), Michael Leskinen has been vocal about the decarbonization of aviation. On June 19, during the Paris Air Show, Michael while talking to Bloomberg highlighted that United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) is working on sustainable fuel production and limiting the green premium. Leskinen predicts the airline industry will convert to hydrogen over the next 20-30 years. In the first quarter 2023 earnings call, United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) addressed the macroeconomic challenges and what the company has done to achieve its operational targets. The company’s Q1 2023 comments mention:“We can’t control what happens with the macro economy, but we can and are doing a great job of controlling our cost. We can’t run your airline like it’s 2019, it’s different and harder now. Cancellation rates are the leading indicator of forward capacity and therefore CASM-ex and United is leading the way on this front. Gerry will discuss some of the year-over-year tailwinds that will drive lower CASM-ex in the back half of this year, but we only need CASM-ex to be approximately 1 point better in the second half of the year to hit our full year target. We remain solidly on track. To wrap up, over the last 3 years, our industry has confronted a rapidly changing environment. United hasn’t been perfect, but we have got a lot more right than normal.In the big picture, we have got it right and took the steps in the last 3 years to thrive in exactly this environment. International is stronger, the operating environment is more challenging, which means reliability is harder, but also had a premium for producing bottom line results and we had confidence that our gauge growth and execution are keeping United uniquely on track for our near and long-term CASM-ex trajectory, that not to say that there aren’t real near-term risk, because we all know there are, but we feel really good about the strategic setup and tactical execution here at United. I want to again thank the entire United team for their hard work this quarter.We continue to see the benefits of running a strong operation. In the first quarter, United led the industry with the lowest seat cancellation rate despite around 20% of our flights being impacted by weather, the most out of any of our competitors. This was the first time since 2012 that we led on this metric. Additionally, United was first or second in the quarter for on-time departures at nearly all of our hub locations, including those heavily impacted by winter weather like O'Hare and Denver. Our airline is built to run well and recover fast and we expect our operation to reflect that in the peak summer season. We continue to navigate the challenges in the current operating environment. Specifically, constrained industry infrastructure, United is working with the U.S. Department of Transportation and FAA regarding operational disruptions and air traffic staffing challenges.”Some of the best airline stocks to buy according to the hedge funds include United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DLA). 15 Most Luxurious Airlines in the WorldOur MethodologyFor this article, we took the data from two of the most credible sources that give ratings to airlines, Skytrax and Airline Ratings. We took the latest list of the best airlines for 2023 and shortlisted the top 15 airlines from both sources. To measure the luxury, we checked the available first class flights from various airports. The first class category is the top-end flight service offered by an airline. The flights were one-way and the prices of each flight were changed to U.S. dollars, as of July 19. The first class flight with the highest price was ranked higher, and so on. Since this is a highly subjective topic, it was not easy to choose flights from any specific airport, as the availability of first class flights and the routes varied. Our methodology to capture the 15 most luxurious airlines in the world isn’t perfect but a reasonable approximation. For certain flights, the distance varied from the airport. For instance, an airline from the Middle East might charge higher for a flight to Australia rather than Europe, depending on its flight routes. This means our methodology can be biased against airlines operating in different regions. The 15 most luxurious airlines in the world are listed in ascending order of the aforementioned metric. Considering luxury, airlines offer various amenities for their first class flights such as early check-ins, private lounges at the airport, and private rooms on flights. In addition, upscale food is served which can include champagne and other fancy delights. 15 Most Luxurious Airlines in the World15.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of why passengers opt for certain airlines and know which airlines came at the top, you can take a look at the 5 most popular airlines in the world. Although passengers place significant importance on the price of tickets when deciding which airline to choose, the NATS Aviation Index 2019 shows that the importance of on-board facilities is increasingly growing. Besides this factor, the reputation of the airline is also essential, as 71% of the people said they would never fly with an airline that has a bad reputation. Based on IATA’s 2022 Global Passenger Survey, convenience was the top priority of passengers traveling in post-COVID times. Most of the passengers included in the survey wanted their planning and booking information in one single place. It’s one of the reasons why airline CIOs are prioritizing increased spending on digitalization and sustainability by 2024 — according to SITA’s 2021 Air Transport IT Insights. Airline companies are also looking to invest in technology that reduces flight times. In 2022, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) agreed to buy supersonic planes from Boom. These planes will travel as fast as Mach 1.7, which will significantly reduce flight time. For instance, a 10-hour flight will only take 6 hours on these planes. Previously, United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) also committed to buying 15 supersonic planes. We also found that these airline companies are among the 12 best airline stocks to buy — along with Ryanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ:RYAAY), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK), JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU) and Spirit Airlines, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAVE). During the pandemic, many countries imposed strict travel restrictions to curb the spread of infections. It caused a significant decline in passengers opting for air travel. Even when the restrictions were lifted, the passengers must carry vaccination certificates. Story continuesA significant number of airline staff was also laid off at that time. Bloomberg reported that about 400,000 airline industry workers lost their jobs during the coronavirus. To help U.S. airlines survive, the government provided a $54 billion lifeline. The airlines that got the bailout included Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV), American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) and others. As a lot of people have started choosing air travel again, airline companies might find it challenging to cater to the demand. If you want your travel plans to not be affected, it's important to reach the airport early and consider flying from a smaller airport. In the case of international travel, you should check the health insurance requirements of the country you’re traveling to and arrange it beforehand. 20 Most Popular Airlines in the WorldMethodology For our list of the most popular airlines worldwide, we analyzed Cirium’s Airline Passenger Rankings for 2021.

PFG is slated to report second-quarter 2023 earnings on Jul 27, after market close. PFG delivered an earnings surprise in three of the last four reported quarters and missed in one, the average being 10.8%.Factors at PlayPrincipal Financial’s second-quarter results are likely to reflect favorable equity and fixed-income markets, positive net cash flow, higher premiums, other considerations and improved fixed maturity yields, offset by lower management fee revenues.Revenues in the Retirement and Income Solutions segment are likely to have decreased because of lower net investment income, declining fee revenues due to average account values pressured by market depreciation and impacts from the 2022 Reinsurance Transaction.Investment income is likely to have been affected by the impacts of the second quarter of 2022 Reinsurance Transaction and lower inflation-based investment returns on Latin America's average invested assets. The downside is likely to have been partially offset by higher fixed maturity yields in U.S. operations and favorable relative market performance on required regulatory investments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net investment income is pegged at $1 billion, suggesting an increase of 26.3% from the year-ago reported figure. We expect investment income to increase 14.8% to $940.8 million.Revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter is likely to have been affected by the impact of exited ULSG business in the Life Insurance business and lower management fee revenues, partly offset by higher premiums and other considerations.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.5 billion, indicating an improvement of 11% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Assets under management are likely to have benefited from favorable equity and fixed income markets, positive net cash flow as well as positive impacts from foreign currency.Expenses are likely to have increased due to higher benefits, claims and settlement expenses and operating expenses. We expect total expenses to increase 11.4% to $3 billion.Operating expenses are likely to have increased due to a rise in amounts credited to employee accounts in a nonqualified defined contribution pension plan and in pension and other postretirement employee benefits expenses. We expect operating expenses to be $1.3 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2023 earnings is pegged at $1.66 per share, indicating an improvement of 0.61% from the year-ago reported figure.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Principal Financial this time around. This is because the stock needs to have the right combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for an earnings beat.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Principal Financial Group (PFG). PFG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 11.74 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 13.91. Over the last 12 months, PFG's Forward P/E has been as high as 13.67 and as low as 9.44, with a median of 11.14.We should also highlight that PFG has a P/B ratio of 1.98. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. PFG's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.95. PFG's P/B has been as high as 2.45 and as low as 1.46, with a median of 1.81, over the past year.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. PFG has a P/S ratio of 1.18. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.78.Story continuesInvestors could also keep in mind Victory Capital Holdings (VCTR), an Financial - Investment Management stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Shares of Victory Capital Holdings currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 6.94, and its PEG ratio is 1.09. In comparison, its industry sports average P/E and PEG ratios of 13.91 and 0.97.VCTR's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.42 and as low as 4.94, with a median of 6.37. During the same time period, its PEG ratio has been as high as 2.87, as low as 0.88, with a median of 2.32.Victory Capital Holdings sports a P/B ratio of 2.17 as well; this compares to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 2.95. In the past 52 weeks, VCTR's P/B has been as high as 2.21, as low as 1.50, with a median of 1.88.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Principal Financial Group and Victory Capital Holdings are likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, PFG and VCTR sticks out as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL, Assurant Inc. AIZ, American Equity Investment Life Holding Co. AEL, Aon AON and Aflac Inc. AFL.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Insurers Set to Outperform Estimates This Earnings SeasonPer the latest Earnings Preview, the Finance sector’s second-quarter 2023 earnings are expected to increase 10.3%. Revenues are estimated to rise 13.5%. Results of Insurance, one of the Finance sector industries, are likely to reflect better pricing and exposure growth, accelerated digitalization and an improved interest rate. However, higher-than-expected cat losses are likely to have weighed on profitabilityWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified five insurers, namely, Arch Capital Group Ltd., Assurant Inc., American Equity Investment Life Holding Co., Aon and Aflac Inc., which are poised to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in second-quarter earnings. These stocks have the ideal combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy), #3 (Hold) — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Factors Likely to Impact Q2 ResultsInsurers are likely to deliver improved investment results. They are beneficiaries of an improved rate environment. The second quarter witnessed one rate hike by the Fed. A larger investment asset base, higher reinvestment rate and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds and real estate among others coupled with an improving rate environment are expected to have aided net investment income. Net investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line.Story continuesLife insurers have been redesigning products, focusing on protection products. Increasing awareness and demand for protection products are likely to have driven sales. Life insurers continue to roll out investment products that provide bundled covers of guaranteed retirement income, life and healthcare to cater to customers preferring policies with “living” benefits more than those with death benefits.The second quarter of 2023 bore the brunt of June storms. JP Morgan estimates insured losses in the second quarter to be about $10 billion as per a report published in Reinsurance News. Nonetheless, better pricing, reinsurance arrangements, portfolio repositioning, reinsurance covers, favorable reserve development and prudent underwriting are likely to drive an improvement in underwriting results.The players continue to make investments in digitalization, which, in turn, is likely to have saved costs and driven margin expansion. Riding on the strength of a solid capital position, insurers engaged in strategic buyouts and mergers, built on a niche, expanded globally, diversified their portfolio and deployed capital to make dividend hikes and pay special dividends. Share buybacks are expected to have provided an additional upside to the bottom line.Potential Q2 OutperformersArch Capital Group offers insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance across the world. Premiums in the second quarter are expected to have benefited from growth in most lines of business, primarily related to rate increases, new business opportunities and gains in existing accounts in the Insurance and the Reinsurance segments. ACGL is expected to have gained from better pricing and increased exposure, which are likely to have aided underwriting profitabilityThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ACGL’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.65, suggesting an increase of 23.1% from the year-ago reported figure. ACGL has an Earnings ESP of +1.57% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Arch Capital Group Ltd. price-eps-surprise | Arch Capital Group Ltd. QuoteAssurant is a global provider of risk management solutions in the housing and lifestyle markets. The Global Lifestyle segment is expected to have benefited from mobile protection program growth in North America, higher Connected Living earnings and strong prior period sales in Global Automotive. Higher net investment income, after client profit sharing, favorable loss experience in select domestic ancillary products and expansion across distribution channels are expected to have aided Global Automotive.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AIZ’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.60, suggesting a decrease of 11.9% from the year-ago reported figure.

QuoteAmerican Equity Investment is a leader in the development and sale of fixed index and fixed rate annuity products.  Expansion into new verticals, the increasing popularity of index products in the market and an improving interest rate environment favoring investment spread are likely to aid quarterly results.

493,718d6b9c-e826-3149-ac14-cfbe36bae3bb,AFL,2023-07-26,AM Best Affirms Credit Ratings of Aflac Incorporated and Its Subsidiaries,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/am-best-affirms-credit-ratings-180700002.html,1690308420,STORY,['AFL'],"[OLDWICK, N.J., July 25, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AM Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of ""aa"" (Superior) of Aflac Life Insurance Japan, Ltd. (Japan), American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Omaha, NE), American Family Life Assurance Company of New York (Albany, NY) and Continental American Insurance Company (Omaha, NE). These companies represent the life/health insurance subsidiaries of Aflac Incorporated (Aflac) (Columbus, GA) [NYSE: AFL] and are collectively referred to as Aflac Incorporated Group. Concurrently, AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of ""a"" (Excellent) and all existing Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR) of Aflac. The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. (See below for a detailed listing of the Long-Term IRs and shelf registration.)The ratings reflect Aflac Incorporated Group’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its strong operating performance, favorable business profile and very strong enterprise risk management (ERM).The rating affirmations reflect Aflac Incorporated Group’s risk-adjusted capitalization at the strongest level, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR) in the United States and excellent solvency ratios in Japan. Risk-adjusted capitalization has been enhanced by its very strong operating performance, which has more than offset realized investment losses in recent years. Aflac’s GAAP equity declined through first-quarter 2023, following the implementation of changes in discount rate assumptions on long-term insurance contracts. However, the drop was significantly below prior expectations due to changes in the interest rate environment. The organization’s investment team continues to manage the challenges effectively of foreign exchange risk. The organization's invested assets are diverse across asset classes and types, and managed both internally and through highly respected external asset managers. The managers continue to de-risk the investment portfolio, which has resulted in a higher allocation to quality fixed-income assets that have favorably impacted the organization’s risk-adjusted capitalization. AM Best notes that the group’s exposure to real estate from commercial mortgages has performed well with virtually no delinquencies, foreclosures or restructured loans over the last several years. The group enjoys the financial flexibility provided by its publicly traded parent company. The flexibility has been further enhanced through a newly established reinsurance subsidiary, Aflac Re, and ceding a modest portion of Japan older cancer policies liabilities to the new entity. That allowed lower capital requirements in Japan and provided additional dividends to the parent company. AM Best notes that Aflac Incorporated Group’s current adjusted financial leverage and operating leverage remain relatively modest for its rating level.Story continuesThe ratings also reflect Aflac Incorporated Group’s continued strong operating margins in Japan and U.S. markets and return on equity remains very favorable. The earnings continue to be favorably impacted by lower benefits utilization in the U. S segment partially offset by higher administrative expenses. While both of Aflac’s operating segments historically have produced favorable results, the group continues to be challenged to reverse the trend of premium decline and grow new sales materially, due to the increasingly competitive market. The company continues to focus actively on client retention strategies, product enhancements and operational capabilities to meet evolving market demands and facilitate growth.AM Best considers Aflac’s ERM management capabilities to be very strong, which is deeply embedded in the organization’s strategy and decision making and has positively impacted its balance sheet strength, operational performance and business profile. The ERM program has continued to demonstrate robust processes within its framework that are effective in identifying potential risks, managing those risks and mitigating them. AM Best’s assessment also includes an evaluation of the program’s risk defense capabilities of multiple exposures and has determined that most are managed with very high capabilities.Aflac has also leveraged its risk management capabilities to maintain its favorable business profile in the Japan market and management has made numerous investments in its U.S. market businesses to well position the company to grow product premium over the next few years. The company is the leader in providing both medical and cancer insurance in Japan, and its strong partnership with Japan Post solidifies its standing as a formidable competitor in that market. In the U.S. market, Aflac continues to be a leader in supplemental medical insurance space.The following Long-Term IRs have been affirmed with a stable outlook:Aflac Incorporated—-- ""a"" (Excellent) on USD 750 million, 3.625% senior unsecured notes, due 2024-- ""a"" (Excellent) on USD 450 million, 3.25% senior unsecured notes, due 2025-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 12.4 billion, 0.3% senior unsecured notes, due 2025-- ""a"" (Excellent) on USD 300 million, 2.875% senior unsecured notes, due 2026-- ""a"" (Excellent) on USD 400 million, 1.125% senior unsecured notes, due 2026-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 60 billion, 0.932% senior unsecured notes, due 2027-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 12.6 billion, 0.5% senior unsecured notes, due 2029-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 33.4 billion, 1.075% senior unsecured notes, due 2029-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 13.3 billion, 0.55% senior unsecured notes, due 2030-- ""a"" (Excellent) on USD 1.0 billion, 3.6% senior unsecured notes, due 2030-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 29.3 billion, 1.159% senior unsecured notes, due 2030-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 9.3 billion, 0.843% senior unsecured notes, due 2031-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 30 billion, 0.633% senior unsecured notes, due 2031-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 20.7 billion, 0.75% senior unsecured notes, due 2032-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 21.1 billion, 1.32% senior unsecured notes, due 2032-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 15.2 billion, 1.488% senior unsecured notes, due 2033-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 12.0 billion, 0.844% senior unsecured notes, due 2033-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 9.8 billion, 0.934% senior unsecured notes, due 2034-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 10.6 billion, 0.83% senior unsecured notes, due 2035-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 10.0 billion, 1.039% senior unsecured notes, due 2036-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 6.5 billion, 1.594% senior unsecured notes, due 2037-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 8.9 billion, 1.75% senior unsecured notes, due 2038-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 6.3 billion, 1.122% senior unsecured notes, due 2039-- ""a"" (Excellent) on USD 400 million, 6.90% senior unsecured notes, due 2039-- ""a"" (Excellent) on USD 450 million, 6.45% senior unsecured notes, due 2040-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 10.0 billion, 1.264% senior unsecured notes, due 2041-- ""a"" (Excellent) on USD 400 million, 4.0% senior unsecured notes, due 2046-- ""a-"" (Excellent) on JPY 60 billion, 2.108% subordinated debentures, due 2047-- ""a"" (Excellent) on USD 550 million, 4.75% senior unsecured notes, due 2049-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 20.0 billion, 1.56% senior unsecured notes, due 2051-- ""a"" (Excellent) on JPY 12.0 billion, 2.144% senior unsecured notes, due 2052The following indicative Long-Term IRs have been affirmed with stable outlooks on securities available under the existing shelf registration:Aflac Incorporated—-- ""a"" (Excellent) on senior unsecured debt-- ""a-"" (Excellent) on subordinated debtThis press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

494,1c1b379f-0726-32c4-80fe-7775e55567b1,AFL,2023-07-26,Can AON Q2 Earnings Beat on Commercial Risk Solutions Growth?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aon-q2-earnings-beat-commercial-163900807.html,1690303140,STORY,"['AON', 'AEL', 'AFL', 'ARES']","[Aon plc AON is set to beat on earnings for the second quarter of 2023, the results for which are scheduled to be released on Jul 28, before the opening bell.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share of $2.82 has witnessed three upward revisions in the past month against no movement in the opposite direction. The estimate is indicative of a 7.2% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported earnings of $2.63 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.2 billion, suggesting a rise of 5.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.AON’s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 1.6%. This is depicted in the graph below.Aon plc Price and EPS SurpriseAon plc Price and EPS SurpriseAon plc price-eps-surprise | Aon plc QuoteWhat the Quantitative Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts a likely earnings beat for AON this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is precisely the case here.Earnings ESP: AON has an Earnings ESP of +2.56%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at $2.90 per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.82. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AON currently has a Zacks Rank #3.Before we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at AON’s previous-quarter performance first.Q1 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, the leading global professional services company’s adjusted earnings per share of $5.17 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.3%, primarily due to increased operating expenses. However, the negatives were partially offset by strong retention, business generation, growth in core P&amp;C, and solid performance in Commercial Risk Solutions’ Latin America, EMEA and Pacific region operations.Story continuesNow, let us see how things have shaped up prior to the second-quarter earnings announcement.Factors Driving Q2 PerformanceCommercial Risk Solutions’ performance in the second quarter is likely to have gained from new business generation, robust retention and management of the renewal book portfolio. Increased travel-related spending, global exposure and pricing are likely to have benefited its performance in the quarter under review.Our estimate for the Commercial Risk Solutions line’s revenues indicates 3% growth from $1,692 million a year ago. The unit’s performance is likely to have been boosted by solid growth in Latin America, EMEA and Pacific regions. Also, its core P&amp;C operations are likely to have improved in the quarter under review.Our estimate for the Health Solutions line’s second-quarter revenues suggests 5% growth from the year-ago level. Growth in core health and benefits brokerage is likely to have aided the segment. Also, improvement in human capital is likely to have boosted the unit’s results in the second quarter.Our estimate for Reinsurance Solutions’ revenues indicates a 12% jump from a year ago. It is likely to have witnessed growth in the to-be-reported quarter on the back of consistent new business generation and strong retention. Improvement in Strategy and Technology Group is likely to have benefited the unit in the second quarter.We expect Wealth Solution’s revenues in the second quarter to have increased 1% from the year-ago period. Increased advisory demand, project-related work and retirement growth are likely to have aided the unit in the quarter under review.All the factors stated above are likely to have positioned the company for overall year-over-year growth and an earnings beat. However, escalating expenses due to substantial investments in the priority areas for long-term growth and an increase in certain discretionary and other expenses are likely to have partially offset the upside.Our model suggests that information technology related costs are likely to have increased nearly 10% in the second quarter, while other general costs are expected to have climbed almost 5% year over year.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies worth considering from the broader finance space, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:American Equity Investment Life Holding Company AEL has an Earnings ESP of +1.70% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Equity Investment’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.67 per share, which indicates a 70.4% increase from the year-ago period. The consensus estimate for AEL’s revenues is pegged at $555 million.Aflac Incorporated AFL has an Earnings ESP of +1.41% and a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aflac’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.42 per share, which remained stable over the past week. AFL beat earnings estimates in all the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 8.2%.Ares Management Corporation ARES has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ares Management’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 84 cents per share, suggesting a 13.5% year-over-year increase.

495,2c2a14e2-6fb3-3e17-b83f-c64a40e95e7c,AFL,2023-07-26,Aflac (AFL) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q2 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aflac-afl-expected-beat-earnings-140123939.html,1690293683,STORY,['AFL'],"[Aflac (AFL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.42 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.7%.Revenues are expected to be $4.52 billion, down 16.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aflac?For Aflac, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.41%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Aflac will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Aflac would post earnings of $1.38 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.55, delivering a surprise of +12.32%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Aflac appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

496,9122203d-b8ba-393b-8214-502a6704e60b,AFL,2023-07-26,5 Insurers Set to Outperform Estimates This Earnings Season,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-insurers-set-outperform-estimates-125500046.html,1690289700,STORY,"['AON', 'ACGL', 'AEL', 'AFL', 'AIZ']","[Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Finance sector’s second-quarter 2023 earnings are expected to increase 10.3%. Revenues are estimated to rise 13.5%. Results of Insurance, one of the Finance sector industries, are likely to reflect better pricing and exposure growth, accelerated digitalization and an improved interest rate. However, higher-than-expected cat losses are likely to have weighed on profitabilityWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified five insurers, namely, Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL, Assurant Inc. AIZ, American Equity Investment Life Holding Company AEL, Aon AON and Aflac Incorporated AFL, which are poised to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in second-quarter earnings. These stocks have the ideal combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy), #3 (Hold) — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Factors Likely to Impact Q2 ResultsInsurers are likely to deliver improved investment results. They are beneficiaries of an improved rate environment. The second quarter witnessed one rate hike by the Fed. A larger investment asset base, higher reinvestment rate and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds and real estate among others coupled with an improving rate environment are expected to have aided net investment income. Net investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line.Life insurers have been redesigning products, focusing on protection products. Increasing awareness and demand for protection products are likely to have driven sales. Life insurers continue to roll out investment products that provide bundled covers of guaranteed retirement income, life and healthcare to cater to customers preferring policies with “living” benefits more than those with death benefits.The second quarter of 2023 bore the brunt of June storms. JP Morgan estimates insured losses in the second quarter to be about $10 billion as per a report published in Reinsurance News. Nonetheless, better pricing, reinsurance arrangements, portfolio repositioning, reinsurance covers, favorable reserve development and prudent underwriting are likely to drive an improvement in underwriting results.The players continue to make investments in digitalization, which, in turn, is likely to have saved costs and driven margin expansion. Riding on the strength of a solid capital position, insurers engaged in strategic buyouts and mergers, built on a niche, expanded globally, diversified their portfolio and deployed capital to make dividend hikes and pay special dividends. Share buybacks are expected to have provided an additional upside to the bottom line.Story continuesPotential Q2 OutperformersArch Capital Group offers insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance across the world. Premiums in the second quarter are expected to have benefited from growth in most lines of business, primarily related to rate increases, new business opportunities and gains in existing accounts in the Insurance and the Reinsurance segments. ACGL is expected to have gained from better pricing and increased exposure, which are likely to have aided underwriting profitabilityThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ACGL’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.65, suggesting an increase of 23.1% from the year-ago reported figure.

Joining me on the call today are John Morikis, Chairman and CEO; Heidi Petz, President and Chief Operating Officer; Al Mistysyn, Chief Financial Officer; and Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President of Enterprise Finance. Sherwin-Williams delivered excellent second quarter results compared to the same period a year ago. These results, coupled with a similar strong performance in the first quarter led to an excellent first half that exceeded the expectations we laid out back in January. Given the strong first half and current visibility into our second half, we are significantly increasing our full year guidance, which John will talk about in just a few minutes. But first, let me touch on a few second quarter highlights. Consolidated net sales in the quarter exceeded our expectations and grew by a mid-single-digit percentage. Sales in all 3 reportable segments came in above our guided range. Gross margin significantly improved sequentially and year-over-year driven by strong volume in the Paint Stores Group and moderating raw material costs. Pricing discipline remains strong. SG&amp;A expense increased over the prior year quarter, though the year-over-year percentage increase was lower than that of our first quarter. Excluding the impact of incremental acquisition and restructuring costs, SG&amp;A increased 8% year-over-year. Approximately 85% of that second quarter increase was related to investments in Paint Store Group long-term growth initiatives with the remainder driven by increases in compensation and benefits. We are highly confident these growth investments will deliver strong returns and benefit our customers. And while we recognize SG&amp;A expense was higher year-over-year in the quarter, we ultimately manage the business to drive operating profit and margin, both of which expanded meaningfully in the quarter. We are committed to investing in and profitably growing the business at the same time. Segment margin in all 3 reportable segments expanded sequentially and year-over-year. We also delivered strong double-digit growth in adjusted diluted net income per share and EBITDA with adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.9% near the high end of our current long-term 19% to 21% target range. Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will provide some commentary on our second quarter results by segment. John will follow Heidi with comments on our outlook before we move on to your questions.Heidi G. PetzThank you, Jim. I'll begin with the Paint Stores Group. Second quarter Paint Stores Group sales were ahead of our expectations and increased 10%, driven by mid-single-digit volume growth and continued effective pricing. Segment margin improved 280 basis points to 24.3%. Growth was led by our protective &amp; marine business, which was up strong double digits and was driven by industrial flooring infrastructure and oil and gas applications. In our pro-architectural end markets, the strongest performers were commercial and property maintenance, both of which increased by double-digit percentages. Residential repaint was close behind with sales up by a high single-digit percentage. Demand in this market is being somewhat tempered by the extended period of weak existing home sales. New residential sales were flat against a double-digit comparison, reflecting the softer start that we saw at the end of last year, which have continued into this year. As we've previously noted, we anticipated new residential would be challenging in 2023, though we are performing better than the market as we continue to focus on new accounts and share gains. Our DIY business was up strong double digits, albeit against a softer comparison where sales were impacted by supply chain challenges. From a product perspective, interior and exterior paint sales were both up high single digits, with interior sales growing faster and representing a larger part of the mix. Sales in our Consumer Brands Group also exceeded our guidance and increased by 5.1% in the quarter, primarily driven by mid-single-digit pricing. Sales in North America, our largest region, increased by a low single-digit percentage. We continue to invest here with our strategic retail partners for growth. In other regions, sales were up strong double digits in Latin America and Europe. Sales in China were down double digits, and we expect the previously announced divestiture of the China business to be completed in the third quarter. Adjusted segment margin was 15.7%, up 470 basis points year-over-year. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased less than 1% against a strong 15.2% comparison. Volume decreased low single digits but was offset by mid-single-digit increases in price. Adjusted segment margin increased 420 basis points to 18% of sales, which is within the range we have been targeting for this business. Sales in PCG varied significantly by region. In North America, sales increased low single digits against a nearly 30% comp. Sales in Europe were up mid-single digits. Latin America sales were down less than 1%, also against a strong comp of over 20%. Demand in Asia remained weak with sales down double digits against a soft period a year ago. From a division perspective, growth was strongest in Auto Refinish, which is up by a high single-digit percentage followed by General Industrial, which was up mid-single digits. Industrial wood sales were up less than 1% as softness in new residential continued to impact demand for furniture, carpentry and flooring. Coil sales were down mid-single digits driven mainly by Europe, which was impacted by last year's Russia exit and against the nearly 40% comparison. Packaging sales were also down low double digits against a 20%-plus comp. We anticipated this decline given the near-term destocking by brand owners that we described on our last call. We continue to feel very good about our position and growth prospects in this end market. With that, let me turn it to John for his comments on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year.John G. MorikisThank you, Heidi. As we said in January, we expected to have a strong first half of the year. Our team exceeded those expectations, and I want to thank all 64,000 of our employees for their relentless focus on serving our customers and for driving continuous improvement across the organization. We also understand that a good first half does not make a good year. We know we have work to do, and that's exactly where we are focused. On our April call, we said we would have a much better idea of how the year might unfold as we got deeper into the painting season. Here's what we're seeing as we begin the second half along with our plans for seizing the opportunities in front of us. In Paint Stores Group, we're facing a strong comparison to the second half a year ago, where sales were up 19%. We see customer backlogs as being solid in commercial, property maintenance and protective &amp; marine throughout the second half, and we expect to deliver very solid strong growth in these end markets. Residential repaint should also be good for us as based on contractor feedback, though visibility here is only about 6 to 8 weeks and existing home sales are likely to remain weak. There's some recent optimism from new residential homebuilders regarding starts, but it won't be enough to move the needle meaningfully for us in 2023. We are more tied to completions, which are slowing. While we are confident we are growing share, we expect new residential volume will be challenging for us in the second half, though the year will likely come in closer to down high single digits compared to the down 10% to 20% full year range we provided in January. In DIY, double-digit growth in the first half was aided by softer comparisons to the prior year, where supply chain headwinds impacted our sales. We do not expect this pace of growth to continue as comparisons become much more difficult in the second half of the year. In Consumer Brands, North America DIY demand remained soft. Europe demand has stabilized and Latin America markets remain mixed. In Performance Coatings, many of our customers continue to report a high level of uncertainty regarding demand. Auto Refinish demand remains an exception and is solid in most regions with shortages in parts and technicians increasing CHOP backlogs. Installations of our systems in North America are up strong double digits year-to-date. This continues to bode well for future sales in this business. General industrial end markets are choppy with North American customers reporting mixed demand by end markets served. Industrial wood demand remains soft, though some positive signs in new residential construction indicate we may have reached the bottom. In Coil, demand is holding up better in the Americas versus Europe and Asia. And finally, in packaging, customers are returning to just in time versus just in case supply chain management, resulting in destocking that we expect will continue in the second half. The longer-term view here is still very robust with customers already committed to fill the additional capacity we're bringing on this year. Let me be very clear on our expectations here. We do not accept the excuse that markets are soft, and therefore, our opportunities are limited. Our job is not to report conditions, but to influence results. We know we cannot defy gravity in terms of the macro environment. But in every business, we are aggressively pursuing new accounts and share of wallet opportunities to drive market share gains. Moving to the cost side. We are revising our raw material outlook. We now expect costs to be down by mid- to high single-digit percentage in 2023 compared to 2022. We expect to see decreases across several commodity categories, though the ranges likely will vary widely. We expect other costs, including wages and other input costs to be up in the mid- to high single-digit range. Compared to the guidance we laid out in January, full year sales growth and raw material costs are trending better than we anticipated. With this first half outperformance we expect considerable year-over-year operating margin expansion and earnings growth for the year. At the same time, these dynamics also afford us the opportunity to accelerate growth and service investments at a higher level than anticipated at the beginning of the year. As a result of these disciplined and enterprise-wide investments, which will drive our customers' continued success. We now expect the year-over-year increase in SG&amp;A to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit range for the full year. As in the past, we are highly confident in our ability to drive future above-market growth, and our returns will justify the actions we are taking now. Now moving on to our specific guidance. We anticipate our third quarter 2023 consolidated net sales will be up or down a low single-digit percentage compared to the third quarter of 2022, with volume down low to mid-single digits. For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated net sales to be up a low single-digit percentage with a volume down a low single-digit percentage. Our sales expectations by segment for the third quarter and the full year are included in the slide deck issued with our press release this morning. We are increasing our full year 2023 diluted net income per share to be in the range of $8.46 to $8.86 per share. We believe this increased range accurately reflects our first half outperformance, continued pricing discipline and moderating raw material costs while also acknowledging the ongoing uncertainty in the second half demand environment. This guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.81 per share. It also includes net expense related to our previously announced targeted restructuring actions of $0.03 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2023 earnings per share in the range of $9.30 to $9.70. This is an increase of 14.5% at the midpoint compared to our prior adjusted guidance of $7.95 to $8.65 per share. We provided a GAAP reconciliation in the Reg G table within our press release. Our slide deck includes additional information on our updated assumptions for the year, along with guidance on our expectations for currency exchange, effective tax rate, CapEx, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. We've also provided an update on our previously announced restructuring efforts. Onetime costs will be lower than previously anticipated. The estimated annual savings from our actions are unchanged. As we begin the second half, we'll remain focused on what we can control. Across the business, this means growing new accounts and share of wallet. It also means developing and retaining talent, improving and simplifying our operations and managing price cost dynamics. We remain confident in our differentiated strategy, our capabilities in our product and service solutions. Should the demand environment prove to be better than we are currently assuming, we would expect to deliver better results. What we can't control is the market. We're not interested in trying to time the economic recovery. What we are interested in is taking full advantage of it when it eventually arrives. This means investing in our growth now ahead of the curve. This approach has served our customers and our shareholders well over multiple past cycles. I have every confidence that it will do so once again. Above all, I have the utmost confidence in our leadership team and our people. They are the true differentiators. Together, we expect to continue outperforming our competitors and the market. This concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.Gregory Scott MelichCongrats guys on a great quarter. I'd love to go a little bit into that, the deceleration that you still expect into the third quarter. I think it sounds like volume total sales are kind of flattish, that we would expect volume to be down kind of low to mid-singles? And maybe give us a little more color on why you expect that deceleration in what you're seeing.Heidi G. PetzGreg, I think it's a great question. I think if you look across our entire enterprise right now, I would just qualify this or characterize this as choppy. I think that's true both by division, by region. When you break it down, our volume is down low to mid-single digits. If you look at Paint Stores Group alone down low single digits. I would say that's primarily due to the new residential slowdown but confident in the increasing starts that we're seeing. Remember, that's against a really tough comp of 19%. That's a bit offset by some of the heavy impact that we're seeing with both PCG and CBG, but I'm confident in our ability to drive above market growth here.Gregory Scott MelichGot it. And I guess my second question is on getting back to those that margin range, the 46% gross margin. Could you remind us of the range you were targeting? And is there a potential to be above that in the cycle, given that it sounds like at least the pricing environment is remaining quite rational.Allen J. MistysynYes, Greg, this is Al Mistysyn. And we're really pleased with the performance of our gross margin. As a reminder, our target is midterm, 45% to 48%. As we have talked about in the past, we -- in our raw material inflationary environment, we put price in to offset those dollars. And then as raw materials moderate, we start seeing the benefit of that pricing to increase our gross margin and helps us cover the continued investments we make to help our customers drive value in their business. So I'd expect the sequential gross margin to be similar to what I saw in this -- what we saw in the second quarter. Price, as you know, we'll start annualizing the price increases in our third quarter, specifically the September 10% in Paint Stores Group plus the other items, other segments that have put pricing in. So for the full year, I think our gross margin, depending on where Paint Stores Group volume is could be in that 45% to 46% range. And then as you know, we'll evaluate that 45% to 48% range over time. And as we get consistency in that range, look to raise the bar and move that target up.John G. MorikisYes. So I'd say we refer to that as our current range. And I'd say in addition to every point that Al just made, the additional steps that we're taking on a regular basis and reviewing the programs that we have, the investments that we're making, the mix of our products, everything that we're doing goes into driving that margin. It's not simply just a price. There's a lot of activity on the operations side to drive inefficiency. We talked last year about some of the inefficiencies as we serve our customers, we were shipping product from 1 point in the country into the other. And so as we continue to optimize our supply chain we expect to continue to drive that as well.Gregory Scott MelichAnd it sounds like even with the lower raw material expectation for this year, your pricing expectations are unchanged. Is that fair?John G. MorikisYes, that's correct. As we continue to invest in our business and bring more value to our customers, we'll invest into that and drive their profitability. And naturally, we'd expect that our shareholders participate in that as well.OperatorYour next question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.Vincent Stephen AndrewsI got 2 questions on SG&amp;A. I guess, first, if you could just help us understand -- I know we've talked about this in the past, but the incremental spending for this year, what details can you give us in terms of what it targets? And then secondly, should the back half of the year play out better than you forecast. Do you have more SG&amp;A activities that you could get into in the back half of the year than you're already guiding to? Or is this SG&amp;A guidance done for the year?John G. MorikisYes, Vincent, let me kick it off kind of my thinking on it and then I'll ask Al to get into some of the details. First, we are going to adjust our investments to market conditions. And these are things that we monitor closely. We reminded the trends in the market, as you just mentioned, activities and opportunities, cost, even the activities of our competitors. And we've seen this before. We'll capitalize on the market opportunities, the competitive shifts and missteps that our competitors make, these are all opportunities. So to your point, as we see raw material trends and these are part of our data set, all roll into what you should expect to see from Sherwin-Williams. We're going to be aggressive. We're going to drive market share and invest in our businesses. And I think it comes down to when you have confidence in your strategy and confidence in your leadership team like we do, you can invest. And while others are adjusting their strategies, we're going to take advantage of any shifts. We will be on the attack.Allen J. MistysynAs you know, we're all about managing operating margin growth and operating margin growth over the long term. So your comment about will we be done with SG&amp;A commentary as the second half goes on. I would say, no. I think as we see how the demand environment and volumes unfold and as they're at or above our expectations, we'll look at that. We'll look at gross margin performance in the second half. And the beautiful thing about our model is we can be very agile across each of the segments, both field sales and tech service reps with the Pro Paint within the Consumer Brands Group. So if we see a path of a higher gross margin than what we have in our current outlook, we'll look to put more investments in our long-term growth initiatives to drive higher share as the market returns.OperatorYour next question is coming from John McNulty from BMO.John Patrick McNultySo in the Paint Stores Group, you had been looking for kind of a flattish guide. Now you're looking for up mid- to high single digits. When you look at the major subsegments of that group. I guess where are you surprised the most? Where are things kind of working out better than you expected?John G. MorikisSo let me start with New Residential because I think that's an important piece. And maybe what we'll do here, John, is I'll start with New Residential, maybe talk about Commercial and then I'll ask Heidi to talk about some additional segments because to be truthful with you, we're very pleased with the execution of our team. We talk a lot about our secret weapon. And we talked about the recruitment and retention of this team. They are truly executing. We couldn't be any more proud. In new residential, I think it's clear to all of us, there's pressure in the new residential space. Our flat sales in this quarter, I believe, are indicative of the share gains we're executing. We talked about penetrating that top 100 builders for the last couple of quarters. And quite honestly, we're working on that, and we're experiencing terrific success, in fact, even deeper into some of the more custom homebuilders as well. It's growing, and we expect to continue to grow there. We continue to execute on our strategy of bringing solutions to these builders to make them more successful. And I think that's the key and core behind everything we do. So in the builders area, the efficiency that we're bringing in our supply chain to help them in innovation, quality, consistency, even as they're adapting into different substrates to help defray costs. We're working with them to ensure that we have the right coatings for them. Importantly, I just talked about our people. I think our stores and our reps in this area -- they're doing a fantastic job of staying close and in contact with not only our builders, but their applicators, which is very unique. And we've got a distribution platform that wherever our builders are building, whatever developments they're pursuing, our stores are where they are building and where they might want to build. So we're not out there promising if you will invest here, we'll invest with you. Our people are there and our assets are there, and we're capitalizing on that. So we're growing share. We've not experienced the depth of decline, as you mentioned, we originally projected. Although I would say we do expect to see softness in the second half. You talked about our strategy here and our commitment to favorably position the company, and we think this segment absolutely demonstrates that. In the commercial side, I'd say we're experiencing very good performance. And again, I think it highlights the advantages of our controlled distribution. We expect the balance of 2023 to be strong. We're really focused on the subsegments inside commercial going forward. So again, really leveraging the value of this controlled distribution model. Our reps and our specification teams are really dialing into those areas that provide opportunity. And even within those areas that might be strong now that could dry up even in those areas. We know that there will be opportunities could be in tenant build-out or wherever in commercial, it might shift we're going to be there. So again, our focus on applicators, the specifiers and the owners, we believe, will pay off for us. Res repaint is another area that I think is really important to talk about. Let me turn it over to Heidi.Heidi G. PetzYes. And as you know, we've had 7 years of double-digit growth here in this segment, and we're confident in our execution. But it's important to know that we're never complacent and doing what we know how to do, we believe we'll take share, especially in this environment. While it's currently positive, we know a slowdown is coming, and it's also being tempered by, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, by the extended period of week existing homes. So having said that, even in that challenging environment, paint will continue to outperform other categories since it is an inexpensive and highly impactful category. There's been a lot of speculation about next year, and I will tell you that the bidding activity has somewhat normalized. And believe it or not, these are actually very good times for Sherwin-Williams, where we believe that adversity brings about opportunity for us. In a large part, our controlled model, as many of us talked about previously, this allows us to dig deeper and not just trying to sell our contractors product, but really taking the time to intersect them where they are in their business and helping them to focus on growth and profitability. We have a lot of data that we've talked about in the past, but I think, and we won't get into specifics or details here. But it's important that as the team is working hard, John mentioned the talent in the frontline here, mining this data for opportunity and getting very surgical in addition to the data leveraging our rep force so that we can be very thoughtful as we approach these contractors and making sure that we're taking advantage of the talent that we've got out there. So we're currently focused on building these relationships and confident that we'll continue to see some aggressive share gains here. I'll hit briefly on the DIY relative to stores. And I think, John, your question was specific to stores. Sales were up double digits in Q2 against a fairly soft comp. We don't expect this to continue at this pace, but we'll note that there's been some very positive foot traffic in our stores relative to the segment. And with that, maybe just a brief touch on P&amp;L.John G. MorikisWell, property maintenance, I think, is another area that performed a little bit better than we expected. And we have a lot of confidence here. A lot of the delayed maintenance we believe now is being addressed. Apartment turnovers are strong and bodes well for us. And again, I think even the idea of return to travel, office and school all help. And as we leverage a national platform of just up stores and reps to be able to really capture that business as well. So it's a good business for us and 1 that performed better as well. Protective &amp; marine was another area that in our stores that performed stronger than I would say we expected. I'll say that here, not to our team. We expect more from our team would be the answer I'd give them. Our core business was very strong, double-digit growth. But we've been investing in this business, and our expectations are high of this team. We've got terrific leaders in this area, and we've been making investments in areas. We've announced a number of acquisitions, for example, in flooring. That's helped us get into some really key opportunities in food and beverage, pharma, even airport hangers, all have been very strong. Energy has been very strong for us. It's another great example where we focus on everything from extraction to processing as well as alternative energy. Government activity here is trying to stimulate has been good for us as well. We see business in the area of mega plants for chips that have been good for us. as well as I mentioned, alternative energy, where we really have done a very nice job of bringing technology from all aspects. We're taking into wind farms, for example, there's 1 that's been promoted in the Northeast. It's going to be a terrific opportunity to bring our marine coatings as well as our heavy-duty petrochem technology to bear in a very unique way. So we're bringing technology. We're bringing a strength of a distribution platform, specifications and it's driving business that the business is very strong.Heidi G. PetzAnd just 1 piece I would add to that, John mentioned recent acquisition in flooring. I think that really is a great illustration of how we're looking at this as a broader portfolio of both technologies and services that we're bringing together in terms of our value proposition. But if I look specifically at something like the battery plants for semiconductors. We're not just excited for those projects, but candidly, for the infrastructure that will eventually surround those projects as well. So we feel we're very uniquely positioned to take advantage of that wave.OperatorYour next question is coming from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho.Christopher S. ParkinsonI was just hoping to get a little bit more color on your longer-term thoughts on PCG margins, just given the competitive dynamics in each of their respective end markets, obviously, ongoing price cost. I mean I think it's safe to say it's significantly better than we thought, at least for the quarter. But going to that kind of unofficial 20% marker. I'm assuming you're feeling pretty good about that. But if you could just give an update on the longer-term thoughts there would be very helpful.John G. MorikisYes, Chris, thanks for your question. I'll start and kick it to Al. You're right. We do feel very good, very proud of Karl Jorgenrud and his entire team. That leadership team is really focused on doing this the right way. So the solutions that we're bringing to our customers and the focus and discipline that we're bringing is part of the strategy we keep repeating. And as we do that, we bring value to our customers and we've been successful. The discipline in that is that if not every gallon is necessarily a good gallon for us as a result. We're focused on key segments, key customers. We're trying to introduce technology and services that help them to make more money. And again, as a result, we believe that our shareholders should participate in that. But the push is to make our customers successful and have discipline doing that. And that's exactly what the PCG team is doing.Allen J. MistysynYes, Chris, I think the takeaway that I'd leave you with is, as we've progressed through 2022 and into 2023, you start seeing consistency in that segment operating margin in either at the bottom of the range or in the range and a couple of additional points. One, they've got the discipline to get price. And when you look at the last 2 years, '21 and '22, they took the front of the 40% increase in raw material costs, and they were able to get price while still driving volume. And when we look at the acquisitions that were made last year, and the integration activities and the synergies that the team is working on. We feel very good about coming out of this year with the operating margins of those acquisitions being accretive to PCG. And then they're also focused on a number of other initiatives, whether it's SKU rationalization, simplification to make operations more efficient that can better serve their customer at a higher level. So I think you put those things together, and that team is on a strong trajectory to hit that 20% target. And then we'll ask for more from there.Christopher S. ParkinsonGot it. And just a very quick follow-up, and also, quite frankly, a corollary of what you just said. I don't get to have myself with the next remark, but it seems things are generally progressing a little bit better than expected. Obviously, that's reflected in the guidance range and so on and so forth. When we take a step back and you look at your portfolio, obviously, you've taken a few extra actions of the last 12 to 18 months in both divesting as well as acquiring. Can you just give kind of a very quick update on where you stand with that thought process? Are there any technologies which you still feel you're focusing on? Are there still assets which you would consider divesting? Just given the actions over the last, quite frankly, 5-plus years? Any update there would be very helpful.John G. MorikisChris, we've done 20 transactions since announcing Valspar, 16 were acquisitions and 6 were divestitures. What we're focused on is and where we want to grow our those areas that we can bring value, that we would be rewarded for bringing solutions to our customers. And we take a hard and disciplined look in other areas. So we've divested -- the Valspar wood divestiture was required by the FTC. We divested Guardsman, which came with Valspar, Wade in Australia, which came with Valspar. We've announced the Huarun in China came with Valspar in the specialty aerosol plant that we've recently announced also came with Valspar. 1 legacy Sherwin business was the thermoplastic road marking business. Here at Sherwin, we're focused on high-value products and areas. So that didn't fit our portfolio. But we've done a lot of really good deals that we believe that can help drive value for our shareholders while bringing solutions to our customers. And with that discipline, to your question on will we continue that discipline continues every day here. We're having discussions every day about programs, the hard discussions about customers, the geographies. We don't want to just put flags on a map. We're here to create value for our shareholders. And it's sometimes hard to make those decisions. But quite frankly, we look at all of these businesses as part of our capital allocation. When we put our money in to buy Valspar, and we inherited a lot of these businesses, that was capital that was allocated. And if it doesn't meet the threshold for our shareholder return, then we make those difficult decisions. And that's part of who we are. And when we're out looking for acquisitions, it's not just what's for sale. We take a very disciplined approach. We've got a team led by Bryan Young here and our team that does a wonderful job in helping to identify what would be fit if it's for sale or not. And if it's not for sale, we go try to have those honest discussions with the owners about why it might be a better fit with Sherwin. So it's a disciplined approach that we take. We're proud of it. We're not out just trying to buy volume or sales or book of business. It has to fit strategically or we're not interested.OperatorYour next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from R.W. Baird &amp; Company.Ghansham PanjabiJohn, as you kind of think about 2023 specific to Paint Stores Group, what do you think the common theme is as it relates to the volume outperformance across your various categories. I'm just curious, is the customer backlogs that were a bit stronger than relative to what you initially thought or market share gains or something else? And then on residential repaint, do you think that vertical could be directionally less sensitive to existing home sales on a go-forward basis relative to the historical baseline?John G. MorikisWell, how about if I take the first piece, and I'll throw it to Heidi on the resale because she's working very closely on that. I think there's a number of areas, Ghansham. I don't want to spend a lot of time on this because I did just hit this, but I think the foundation of our strategy and our focus really comes down to the people that I just mentioned. We talked about this management training program that we've had for over 40 years. We recruit 1,500 college graduates every year. So we're recruiting and we're training and developing the best talent, we believe. And yes, we've made some compensation adjustments that appeared in our SG&amp;A to retain this talent. And we think that was a great investment, and we'd make it every day because we're going to win or lose by our people. And so when you ask about what's happening in the market, I think, quite honestly, our people are executing. It's a very choppy market out there right now. There were times when you would talk with customers, and they would say they've not advertised in 5 years and some of our customers had never advertised at all. They were spin-off of working for someone else and the market has been so hot, that they just put a sign up in the first house they painted and then it started to roll. Now with the adversity in the market, we look that much more attractive to painting contractors that are looking for assistance and looking for help. And we welcome that. It's the reason we have over 3,000 sales reps and nearly 5,000 stores in the market. We don't look at our position nationally. We look at our business market by market, customer by customer, and we're trying to address their needs. And so I don't think that there's a lot of wind in the sales of a lot of people on the architectural side, there's good a good book of backlog business, as Heidi mentioned, but there's some uncertainty and there's some choppiness. And our people are there to paraphrase this almost to hold the hands of these important customers and help them through that. And as a result, we get rewarded. So we're executing really well in a choppy market. That's how it would respond how we're performing in the market. regarding res repaint specifically, Heidi, maybe I'll have you answer that.Heidi G. PetzYes, Ghansham, I think the good question. In terms of the reliance on resale, I think that the inverse is true as well, which is that those that are staying in place, making sure that they're aware that this is really about the opportunity to raise the value of their home if they choose to stay. We mentioned earlier the inexpensive and highly impactful project. I mentioned the data earlier. I'd like to go back to that. I think it's a great example of how we're able to penetrate and not be reliant on the resale market. In terms of our ability to go back -- I'll give you an example, again, without getting into too much detail, mining for the data for those customers that haven't bought paint in a while for customers based on a certain demographic that we know are more likely or a certain region that are more likely to reengage in the category. Mentioned earlier, our team, something that really differentiates us in this space is we've got 1,500 graduates every year that really own the P&amp;L in their store, and they're hunting for this exact customer. So a lot of respect for the people out that are building these relationships and making sure that whether it's a homeowner or a contractor making sure that we're being very surgical in terms of how we approach these really important customers.James R. JayeAnd I'd add 1 thing to that as well, Ghansham, what you're seeing with the softness in existing home sales as an extended period what we're seeing is people can't wait. So that's driving them to new res. And I think that's also supporting some of the new res business. And as we've spoken many times about our business as a table, whichever way the market may tilt. I think it's a great example as John walked through new res, telling you how well prepared and how much value we bring in that area as these folks simply can't find a home to move into because the inventory is so low, we're going to go new build, and we're right there.Ghansham PanjabiGot it. And then for my second question, on PCG, several categories seem to have been impacted by destocking across the various regions. Where are we in that process, do you think? You give some comments on packaging? What about the other major verticals?John G. MorikisWell, I would like to talk about packaging because if there is 1, Ghansham, that fits your description there, it would be packaging. We've got customers working through softer demand and overstock. And as we see that continue. It's likely going to continue through Q3, perhaps even Q4. But we feel really confident. This is a strong team with a growing position with great technology. We talked about this V70 unique technology that is really fantastic, and we hear it from our customers. It's a plug and play. It's really highly efficient is superior in its ability to keep flavor protection of the product, next-gen non-BPA. It's just a fantastic product, and it's been very well received by our customers. So we've got confidence in this business. It's just going to be bumpy. And while we have high expectations, we often push hard. We also have to be realistic with our team. So we're feeling good there. When you look at the rest of the businesses inside our PCG business, we mentioned it's bumpy. We've got some that might be more resilient as others. We talked about auto refinish. This is a team that's really hitting on all cylinders, unintended that is really leveraging the technology combination from Valspar and Sherwin together, along with the platform of stores. Many people think about stores through our architectural Paint Stores Group, but we bring the same value through our automotive stores direct to customer, and we are really growing business there as well. Our general industrial business is 1 that is kind of a mixed bag. If you look at areas such as large ag and construction is doing well, where building products and general finishing is soft. So when you look at this business, and you look around wherever you are right now, the office, every substate that you see likely is 1 of 2 businesses, general industrial or industrial wood and our businesses there offer a terrific opportunity, but they're going to be a little bit bumpy. In Coil, I would say we had a decrease in Coil, largely driven by Europe and Asia. North America is holding up a little bit better than other regions. But again, it's a team that's bringing a unique responsiveness to customers' needs in a way that help us grow market share even in a down market.Operatoryour next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan Securities.Jeffrey John ZekauskasIs it fair to say that in the first half, raw materials were down by a low to mid-single-digit rate? And in the second half as a base case they should be down by a high single-digit rate.Allen J. MistysynYes, Jeff, I would say you are correct, maybe not quite high single digit on the second half, but close to it, yes.Jeffrey John ZekauskasOkay.Allen J. MistysynThird quarter, actually, it will be up our high -- it will be the best improvement year-over-year. Would be the highest, yes.Jeffrey John ZekauskasAnd as a base case, for 2024, when you look across your businesses, do you expect your general level of prices to be higher or lower or flat?Allen J. MistysynSitting here today, Jeff. We continue to talk about our pricing and our ability to maintain pricing as the raw materials moderate because of the solutions that we drive. I don't think we're ready to talk about incremental pricing for 2024. We have -- we look at the total input cost basket to determine if we need a price or don't need a price. And as you know, any price discussions we have we'd have them with our customers first then talk to the Street. So we have time to talk about 2024 over the next 1.5 quarters.OperatorYour next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.David L. BegleiterJohn, Al, how should we think about second half earnings in terms of the cadence between Q3 and Q4?Allen J. MistysynYes. David, I mean, when you look at the earnings, as John and Heidi talked about, our visibility and demand, which is going to drive our performance through the second half is limited. So we have a better line of sight in our third quarter than our second quarter. We're not -- we don't give EPS or fourth quarter. We don't give EPS guidance, but a couple of other things I would note, I do expect to see a seasonal slowdown in architectural in our fourth quarter, which will impact our gross margin as it historically has done. So I believe this is a year that is the second half more what I would say, typical than some of the last 3 years. But our third quarter is typically a stronger quarter, and I'd expect that to continue.David L. BegleiterAnd John, 1 of your competitors announced a couple of homebuilder wins over the last few months. Why do you think they won that business and you may have lost that business? And overall, how is the competitive landscape in that portion of the business?John G. MorikisYes. Thanks for that. I'd start with every single customer is important to us, everyone. I also think it's important that you understand how we think to us, we play every day in the world series. And we want to sweep the series. We want to win every single game. But we're also realist. We're not going to expect every 1 of our pictures to throw a perfect game were to win every game is a shut out. But I'll tell you this, I believe we have the best team, the best resources and great momentum. So even if our competitors score an occasional run or if our pictures throw up occasional ball here or there, we're not going to panic. We've got, we believe, the right team will sweep the series. And we're out there right now. We believe if you look at that top 100 builders and the penetration that we have, we're growing it and growing it aggressively, and we expect that to continue. And we're doing that at all our competitors' expense. We just don't choose to talk about it.OperatorYour next question is coming from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo.Michael Joseph SisonWith the third quarter volumes potentially being down, do you think things are bottoming as I think about the fourth quarter volumes look like they could be flattish to maybe even up? And then -- and how do you think about 24% volume growth next year? Do you think it's -- we could be in a position to start growing again?John G. MorikisYes. Mike, take 1 more run at that question here, maybe I missed.Michael Joseph SisonYes, I guess for quarter. I guess I'm trying to understand if you think things are bottoming here in the third and then potential for volume growth for the total entity maybe into the fourth quarter and into 2024?John G. MorikisYes. I think that's a challenge answer. I'd say if you look at new residential, we're suggesting that we've outperformed, for example, in new residential and that we expect the balance of the year to be a little bumpier. Housing starts are starting to come back, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, but even homes that are they break ground today, it's likely going to be for the future likely next year before we start painting those. And so I don't -- I'd say we're probably bouncing around here a little bit. We'll see what happens. But our approach has been right now that as the market is soft, our goal is to outperform it. And going forward between Q3 and Q4 gallons, I'd say it's likely going to trend about where we are.Allen J. MistysynYes. I think on if you look at we said projected to be flat to low single digits. But when you look at the dollars, sequentially, they're pretty close. And that's with new res declining more in our third quarter than we expected in our fourth quarter, which tells you we have some strength in our other segments that John and Heidi talked about, and it's going up against the 21.5% comp last year. So when you think about the second half, Paint Stores Group has a tough comp, I'd say the other segments, as we talked about, are choppy, and it's by business, by region. I think some businesses in certain regions have bottomed out. I think there's still challenges that we see in Asia Pacific. But as an example, Europe in our second half, we expect to do better than what we did in the first half. 2024, that's a whole different discussion that we'll have as we get into January on our year-end call.Heidi G. PetzOne piece I would add to that, I think, is just an indicator of the strength of the backlog. I think if you look at stronger and more solid backlogs across commercial property maintenance and PNM. And I would also say it's not just the backlog, it's the way in which we're interacting with these customers. We're close to these customers than we've ever been before, which is a large part based on our controlled distribution model, but it's also based on coming out of the last few years of a lot of challenges. I think we've all essentially become better planners together. So those backlogs our component, but also our closeness to the customer, gives me a lot of confidence in the outlook.OperatorYour next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.Arun Shankar ViswanathanI guess I just wanted to follow up on that last point as far as backlog. Could you potentially provide us with some backlogs across maybe some of the different market segments that you're seeing in PSG? I know when you started out the year, you noted that there was quite a few jobs still in the backlog on the new side through the first half, but then it really kind of limited after that. So how would you characterize the backlog now, if you can provide a little bit more granularity on that?John G. MorikisYes, Arun, I'd say I'll jump in here. I think if you look at the points that Heidi is making, I think there's 2 points. You're asking 1 very good question, but there's another element here that I want to tie to this. One is if you look across the various segments and say, okay, commercial, we see strong residential repaint, a little bit choppier with resales, but we can see out 6 to 8 months property maintenance strong. DIY has been strong, but it's on a softer comps, so we don't expect that to continue. I think all of those are opportunities for us to continue to grow market share, and we will. The other point, though, that I think she's talking -- that she spoke to that I think is important is coming through COVID and in the shortage we've worked much closer with our customers in ways that, quite honestly, I wish I would have had that opportunity when I was in a store. We're now working collaboratively with what projects are taking place now, what's next, even to the point where if it rains, my fallback is this position. And the fact that we've got our reps and our stores out there, close to the backlog and close with our customers closer than ever before is a terrific advantage that we're trying to leverage. So by segment, I would say, yes, we see new residential likely to slow down a little bit as the slowdown works its way to the painting phase of the homes that weren't started 8 months ago. property maintenance, we're really leveraging the fact that their CapEx money is freeing up. Our national agreements are opportunities for us and the others, as I described. So it's a good market for us because there's a lot of diversity in the market, and that's what we thrive on.Arun Shankar ViswanathanThat's helpful. And then a follow-up on the raw material side. Could you just maybe provide us with some idea of what you've been procuring at in the second quarter? I would imagine it's maybe down mid- to high single digits. And does that flow through, I guess, in the second half? And have you seen any declines in TiO2 as well? Or do you expect any of those?James R. JayeYes, Arun. So our raw material basket in the second quarter was down in that high single-digit range. And what was really driving that deflation for us, as you might expect, is the petrochemical side of the basket, resins, in solvents, even plastic packaging, the decline in some of the key feedstocks such as propylene, it's now flowing through into the things that we're buying, and we expect that to continue -- this is a cycle that we've seen many times over the years. With regard to TiO2, your question there, those costs are still a little bit elevated for us, but we expect to see them starting to trend in a more positive direction as the year goes on. Some of the key input costs on TiO2 are elevated right now, chlorine being 1 of the main ones. And I'd also say some suppliers are also trying to manage their capacity a little bit more tightly. But with demand soft here, you're going to see or we believe we're going to see and expect to see some decreases in the TiO2 pricing.OperatorYour next question is coming from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs.Patrick Duffy FischerI was hoping you could help us just triangulate a little bit. When you look at the midpoint of your guide, what it implies is the back half versus the first half this year is going to be down 22% on EPS. But when you look at the last 7 years, the average is for that to be up 6%, and it's been up 5 of the 7 years. So when you add the raw materials should be better in the second half versus the first. I just have a hard time triangulating that new resi will be a big enough negative to take the earnings down on a sequential basis, first half to second half. So -- could you just talk through what else might be negative first half to second half?Allen J. MistysynYes, Duffy. I mean it starts with that sales outlook down mid-single digit from for second half versus first half. Less price would be in that. So we've got a nice tailwind in the first half for price that helped drive our operating -- our gross margin. And so you also see a lower volume, specifically in consumer and in Performance Coatings Group. So I think as you would expect, you're going to get lower gross profit dollars. I do still expect gross margin expansion in our second half, not quite as good as year-over-year anyway that we saw in our first half because of our comps. And then you do get some help on the raw material reduction, but that is partially offset by lower fixed cost absorption in our second half due to lower production volumes. I think SG&amp;A, even we talked about SG&amp;A and the opening and being more aggressive at adding investments for our long-term growth strategy, both in stores, reps, field tech service reps. And the final piece these nonoperating costs that I'd call out that were -- are probably going to be an incremental $60 million to $70 million headwind versus our first half because some of the gains that we had on sale of assets and marketable securities. So I think those are the things that are driving that sequential movement.Patrick Duffy FischerOkay. And then just, again, if we ever get back to normal, whatever that is, do you still believe that your structural footprint is the second half earnings profile is better than the first half earnings profile for the company?Allen J. MistysynYes, Duffy, I try to go back to a normal year 2019. So to your point, I'm not sure what normal is. But I think as we continue to see growth in our Performance Coatings Group, that's less seasonal. You might not see as big of an increase in our second half versus our first half as we move forward. But if we get back to the way Paint Stores Group brand, our consumer business yes, you should typically see that.John G. MorikisOkay. I guess I'd just add on to the investment strategy that Al mentioned, we're a 157-year-old company. We're not trying to run the company for a perfect quarter here. We've got confidence in our strategy. It's a proven strategy with proven leadership team. through a proven and growing asset base in stores and the facilities that we're running. So to Al's point, we're going to invest into that. And we played a long game here. We know what we're doing. And quite frankly, we're going to do more of it.OperatorYour next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman &amp; Associates.Adam Michael BaumgartenJust curious if you could give an update on the Pros paint business and how that's been trending?Heidi G. PetzYes, a good question, Adam. I think there's a lot of growing -- certainly growing interest here as it relates to how we're partnering with our strategic retail partners and certainly the investment that's following that with a lot of confidence and growth to be gained there. And I won't get into a lot of the details because I think those are certainly for our retailer partners to share. But I can tell you that the level of collaboration an alignment from the planning standpoint, certainly understanding how the calendar lays out, laying in key events throughout the year, making sure that the data is aligned, the reps are aligned, that the structures are aligned. It's -- we're just getting started hearing. We've got a lot of confidence in where this can go.Adam Michael BaumgartenGot it. And then maybe just if you could discuss some of the simplification efforts you're making across the enterprise and kind of the time line there and the impacts you ultimately expect that to have on the business?Heidi G. PetzYes, it's a great question. I will tell you that, that's going to be a journey onto itself. So when you think about it, how we're kind of broadly defining this is truly looking end to end. Al mentioned this earlier, where we're looking to bring some efficiencies certainly with our global supply chain team. Al mentioned the Performance Coatings Group, I'd say true for all groups and for our supply chain as well, really understanding all the way from the raw materials you asked -- the question was asked earlier, Jim mentioned how we're thinking about procurement in general. The conversations that we're having are I would say a lot more detailed relative to the sub-supplier level and making sure that when we step back and look at our supplier strategy, there's a distinction between strategic suppliers and transactional suppliers. So we're having those very important conversations at the front end. And then if I take you all the way through, Al mentioned rationalization efforts that are underway. But as you can imagine, as we simplify the basket, and continue the rationalization efforts from a customer-facing standpoint, it puts us in a much more optimized and efficient standpoint from an operational manufacturing logistics. And so there's a lot of milestones that the team is setting forward here. This will be a multiyear journey, as I mentioned, but I would expect that we'll see some customer-facing updates as it relates to how we can compete with a more aggressive portfolio of products here in the short run. And then you'll see that continue to show up to the bottom line as we move faster and faster towards automation and the like.Allen J. MistysynOnly thing I would add to that, Adam, is we talk about efficiencies, but we also are focused on these efforts to increase our capacity so that we're not having to put capital back into capacity and then also looking at opportunities for working capital reduction. So John talked about the divestitures and part of our capital allocation philosophy, it's really a strong and focus on delivering cash generation back to our targets that we laid out and also how we utilize our -- best utilize our assets.OperatorYour next question is coming from Josh Spector from UBS.Joshua David SpectorSo just a follow-up on working capital and specifically inventory. So I mean your inventory stepped down a few million -- a few hundred million sequentially. Just curious if you'd say you have your volumes of inventory at the right level for what you're expecting in terms of second half volumes or if you're continuing to destock that inventory through the year, and really what that means for your expectations for working capital for 2023?Allen J. MistysynSure, Josh. As typically is the case as we get into the summer selling season, we will see a sequential decrease in our inventory gains, as you mentioned. I think you'll see a sequential decrease in our third quarter, which is also typical. And then we'll build inventory back in our fourth quarter to our targeted numbers that are similar to prior -- similar to last year, but to more historic levels. So I feel very good about where our inventories are at today. That being said, we'll adjust production through the second half to maintain that targeted year-end inventory. I don't want to get us too far ahead going into next year. So we'll monitor demand trends closely and adjust production schedules accordingly. We'll try to push that working capital back towards our target by year-end. I think that's going to be a little difficult considering accounts payables because of the lower production is what's driving our increase over that 13%. But we'll get that working capital back towards the target of 11%, 11.5% going forward.OperatorYour next question is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.Stephen V. ByrneRoughly increase in SG&amp;A that you're expecting for the year. Can you talk a little bit about what exactly is driving that? Is that underlying wages -- is it variable comp to incentivize aggressive effort in sales? Is that headcount? Is it something else? Is it a digital app? What would you say is driving that? What are the primary buckets driving a 10% increase in SG&amp;A?John G. MorikisYes, Steve, I don't think it's in our best interest to lay out exactly where our investments are to be truthful with you. I would say that we have a proven leadership team. We've been at this for a long time. We see opportunities, and we invest many of the topics that you brought up are areas of investment. So yes, we're going to invest in securing our people, the retention of our people, the training of our people. We're going to add reps through our stores and through other channels that are important to us. We're investing in innovation and digital. We're not going to get into any specifics deeper than that. But we believe -- and quite frankly, we're very proud that when we make an investment that our shareholders can count on a return, and we've demonstrated the discipline to be able to do that.Stephen V. ByrneAnd then on your cost structure, Al, if I heard you right, I think you've indicated low single-digit deflation in raw material costs, and I believe that was not current purchases, but what flowed through COGS in the second quarter -- is there something else that was a meaningful change year-over-year in cost structure like freight or logistics or something because your gross profit increased year-over-year, significantly more than revenue. There seems to be maybe something else in there other than just low single-digit raws.Allen J. MistysynSteve, we had better than low single-digit raw in the second quarter. If that's what I said, that wasn't correct. We had more like high single-digit reduction in raw material costs. And what I said is the offset -- partially offset by lower fixed cost absorption because we had lower production volumes in the second quarter, mainly because we had to rebuild inventories last year, and we didn't have to redo that. So we're at a more typical production schedule this year than last year. So that's maybe what the little bit of a headwind would have been in the quarter versus raw material benefits.John G. MorikisWith a more optimized supply chain this year versus last year, Steve, last year, literally, we were taking raws wherever we could make them or get them manufacturing paint and sending it to customers wherever they needed it. And we absorbed that into our margin. But I think, again, it speaks to the commitment we make to our customers and why they can count on us.OperatorYour next question is coming from (inaudible).Unidentified AnalystYou talked about the fixed cost drag from lower production volumes. How much lower are utilization rates versus historical levels? And if the recent uptrend maybe in housing starts or commercial and property hangs in there, do you expect to bump up to historic high utilization rates in 2024 and perhaps even prebuild more additional inventory in 4Q?John G. MorikisPatrick, we don't talk about capacity utilization. I will tell you this that we've added some capacity. So we've got the ability to be more responsive to our customers' needs. When we talked about taking working capital down, Al's comments about getting down in that 11.5% range. We have confidence in our ability to do that. while improving service to our customers as we go through the simplification efforts that his leading to the company on the operational side as well as the capacity that we have.OperatorYour next question is coming from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc.Aleksey V. YefremovI just had one question. On DIY, you have easy comps in the first half, getting to harder comps in the second half. What is the underlying trend here for your business and the market overall? Is it sequentially still decelerating, improving or stable?Heidi G. PetzI'll start with that. I think if you look at DIY and our Paint Stores Group, I give you a slightly different response versus what we're seeing in the rest of our business and largely based on the premise that there's a slightly different segment and a customer that's looking for more service that want more of that specialty paint store experience. So as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing traffic up in our stores. I think the challenge on the softness and you'll see this on the consumer brand side as well. We've gotten back into a strong position of inventory. You'll see some more promotional activity that's been happening in an effort to drive traffic. But but still continue to see some of that softness coming in the current state, at least through the balance of the year.OperatorYour next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners.Kevin William McCarthyIn your consumer business, can you speak to the outlook for repair and remodeling activity. And given that backdrop, do you expect your market share among Pros to paint to rise or fall or stay about the same over the next year or so?John G. MorikisWe expect our market share to grow. And if you look at what's happening from a Lyra standpoint, predictions on what's going to happen right now, I'd say, there's a slowing in the remodel business, but the truth be told is that this is an opportunity for us. In our business, there are a lot of people that talk about percentages and might both large percentage increases on a relatively small business. And quite frankly, this is a new and growing opportunity for us. So the dollars are not where we believe they can be percentage-wise, we have significant increases, and we expect those increases to continue as we partner with our customers who are interested in growing this. And importantly, I think to understand the strategy here. There are customers, particularly those that pet as a part of their project that prefer a home center model. Some of those customers might find their way into our stores. And a natural question is the concern about cannibalization. We're not concerned with that. we'll gladly put that share of business up, knowing that there's a significant opportunity for us to grow with our partners to pursue the remodeler, if you will, who is using paint on a project. So yes, it's going to grow. We're focused on it with our customers, and we're the determines group combined. So we expect positive growth.Kevin William McCarthyAnd secondly, if I may, perhaps for Al, it appears as though your 2023 CapEx outlook declined by $100 million to $700 million. Why is that? Is that a function of timing or any meaningful changes to the project (inaudible)?Allen J. MistysynYes, Kevin, it's all related to timing. We're still moving forward with the (inaudible) expansion that we had talked about earlier this year. We're still moving forward with the warehouse automation projects that we had talked about and continued driving the packaging capacity expansion that we talked about. So it's just timing and with a better line of sight to the second half we thought we'd update that number.OperatorYour next question is coming from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global.Michael Joseph HarrisonYou've completed a handful of acquisitions and you're integrating those in the Performance Coatings business. Can you just give us an update on how you're seeing those operating and commercial synergies progressing on some of the key deals that you've completed?Heidi G. PetzYes, Mike, it's a great question. I think there's a whole host of acquisitions John mentioned earlier. And I would say the team is laser focused on, first and foremost, making sure that these integrations are seamless to the customer. We're very focused on the integration at the team level. I think when you look at some of our -- the acquisitions that have been around technologies, our ability to quickly -- the tech transfer has been an area of focus so that we're able to get those products outside of 1 necessary region and in some cases, moving across the country or moving them across globally. So we're really focused on making sure we're getting the value capture out of some of these and the synergies that we know are there. But there's a lot of great work being done by the teams to make sure that we're keeping our customers focused on a fuller assortment in a fuller portfolio of choices based on these acquisitions.Michael Joseph HarrisonAll right. And then you mentioned in the consumer business that you were seeing some stabilization in Europe. I was hoping that you could maybe provide a little more detail on what you're seeing there and maybe what your expectations look like for the second half in Europe, both in terms of demand and as you think about the price/cost front?John G. MorikisYou're talking about on the consumer side in Europe?Michael Joseph HarrisonConsumer in Europe, yes.John G. MorikisYes. So first, to capture this, it's a relatively small percentage of our overall business. It's -- we're proud of our relationship there. We play a kind of a niche role, if you will, in intended paint through the Valspar brand this came to us with our acquisition. We've got a terrific relationship that we're interested in growing. And I'd say the momentum that we have is good, and we're excited about it.Heidi G. PetzOf that, too, just based on some of the economic recovery, the stability that we're seeing coming in, and I think it's playing to our favor based on this tented program that's unique in a lot of these countries.OperatorYour next question is coming from John Roberts from Credit Suisse.John Ezekiel E. RobertsCould you just remind us how big U.S. new res is as a percent of total sales? And even though your paint doesn't get applied until completion, I think you bid it closer to the start. So what's the -- can you quantify at all what the bidding activity has been or the backlog?James R. JayeJohn, new residential is a mid-teens percentage of our Paint Stores Group.John G. MorikisAnd we don't bid house, John. We quote our customers on a regular basis, and those are fluid discussions that we have with our customers. So it varies by customer, the timing of any agreements that we have, and we just work closely with our customers to ensure that they have as much lead time to any adjustments to pricing as possible.John Ezekiel E. RobertsOkay. Even the largest homebuilders?John G. MorikisEven the largest.OperatorYour next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.Eric BosshardClarity on 2 things, if you could. First of all, on raws. The 5 to 9 full year, what was the first half of raw material?James R. JayeYes. The first half, I'd say our second half is going to be better than our first half, Eric. In the first quarter, it was a pretty modest. If you remember, we said it was a pretty modest deflation. It got better. I mentioned sort of high single-digit range in the second quarter. It will be better in the second half with probably the third quarter, probably the peak year-over-year benefit.Eric BosshardAnd then secondly, relative to the original guidance, is the increase relative to what you thought the year would look like, it is that even between the first half and second half? Or is that more first half loaded?James R. JayeYes. Eric, I'd say it's more first half loaded. And as we talked about, we expected a strong first half and demand, as we, again, talked about, was stronger in our first half. So it's more first half loaded.Eric BosshardOkay. And then is there anything different that makes it more first half loaded? Or is there -- I understand the comparisons -- the comparisons existed there were comparisons in the first half as well. I mean is there something that makes -- creates more benefit in the first half than the second half.Allen J. MistysynYes, the comparisons are better. We get more price tailwind in our first half -- and even with that within admin, we had some gains on sale assets and stuff like that, that maybe helped us $0.05 in the second quarter. But yes, the comps are going to get steeper and -- and then it's the outlook on the choppy demand environment. And I would say that's -- while you don't see a bigger tailwind on our second half plus the investments we're making for future growth.OperatorYour next question is coming from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital.Garik Simha ShmoisJust want to follow up on the strength you're seeing in commercial within Paint Stores Group. It runs a little bit contrary to some of the macro that's been a bit choppier on commercial. So I'm just wondering how much of that is maybe share gains versus a particular vertical that you've been over exposing yourselves to?John G. MorikisWe do believe we're gaining share there. It's a great opportunity again to highlight this controlled distribution. The approach that we take has been grounded in the focus on the applicator on the specifier and the owner through a distribution platform that is first class. And so our reps are working hand-in-hand with our customers. I would say that many of our customers would see our reps almost as part of their team. And the more challenging the market, the more valuable that sales rep is and the facilities that we build to service those needs. So yes, I think we're growing share I think there's a good -- really good momentum through the balance of the year, rolling into next year. From there, as I mentioned earlier, while we're not waiting for the business that -- to finish up, we're very focused on those subsegments that I mentioned earlier that are a bit more resilient that we're focused on to continue the momentum.Garik Simha ShmoisOkay. And I wanted to follow up on resi repaint, you talked about contractor visibility and backlog several times. I just wonder if you could put that in context is the visibility in backlog that you're hearing from your contractor customers. Are these back to more normalized levels at this point? Or are we still running below normal given some of the headwinds over the last several quarters?Heidi G. PetzI would say they're back to more normalized levels. I think you'll see, depending on the size of the rest repaint contractor, some that are willing to take on more and have the labor and the support and the resources to do that and some that are smaller in size and that might be more governed by shortage and labor. We're really trying to intercept them at that point and help them focus on how they can be as productive as possible. So everything from our product assortment to our tools to our reps and how we're engaging these contractors, making sure that when they're on the job site, they're as productive as possible, how they bid, how they quote, how they get paid. So really trying to help them from an entire business standpoint, regardless of the maturity of their size.OperatorThat concludes our Q&amp;A session. I will now hand the conference back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Please go ahead.James R. JayeI want to thank everybody again for joining our call today. I hope you heard come through loud and clear. Our team is aligned and committed to growing our business profitably, but we're also going to invest in growth and customer-facing initiatives.

Let's talk about Sherwin-Williams, those shares up about 4 and 1/2% today. Again looking at price hikes, they're driving the company to record revenue in the quarter, also raising its full year profit outlook here.So I'm always interested, we've always been interested in this one and kind of what it implies about housing, about home decor, about spending on those areas.

What's going on here with Sherwin-Williams?- That was a long time ago.- I guess it was. Well, Sherwin-Williams, you got to cut some of these prices, wow.

Growing steadily since our inception into an esteemed Fortune 500 corporation, our annual revenues during 2022 were approximately $13.4 billion. UHS ranked #311 on the Fortune 500; and #434 on Forbes' list of America's Largest Public Companies. UHS was again recognized as one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune. Our operating philosophy is as effective today as it was upon the Company's founding in 1979, enabling us to provide compassionate care to our patients and their loved ones.  Our strategy includes building or acquiring high quality hospitals in rapidly growing markets, investing in the people and equipment needed to allow each facility to thrive, and becoming the leading healthcare provider in each community we serve.Headquartered in King of Prussia, PA, UHS has approximately 93,800 employees and, through its subsidiaries, operates 27 inpatient acute care hospitals, 331 inpatient behavioral health facilities, 42 outpatient facilities and ambulatory care access points, an insurance offering, a physician network and various related services located in 39 states, Washington, D.C., the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico. It acts as the advisor to Universal Health Realty Income Trust, a real estate investment trust (NYSE:UHT).  For additional information visit www.uhs.com.This press release contains forward-looking statements based on current management expectations.  Numerous factors, including those disclosed herein, those related to the potential impact of COVID-19 on our operations and financial results, those related to healthcare industry trends and those detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (as set forth in Item 2-Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 and in Item 1A-Risk Factors, and Item 7-Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors, in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022), may cause the results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.  These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and therefore actual results may differ materially.  Readers should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements which reflect management's view only as of the date hereof.  We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, or to make any other forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Many of the factors that could affect our future results are beyond our control or ability to predict, including, but not limited to:The nationwide shortage of nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers. In some areas, the labor scarcity is putting a strain on our resources and staff, which has required us to utilize higher‑cost temporary labor and pay premiums above standard compensation for essential workers. These factors, which had a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations during 2022, could continue to have an unfavorable material impact on our results of operations for the foreseeable future.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in March, 2020, has had a material effect on our operations and financial results, at various times, since that time. We cannot predict if there will be future disruptions caused by the COVID‑19 pandemic. A significant portion of our revenues are derived from federal and state government programs including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Payments from these programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions.  Changes to these programs, if adopted, could materially affect program payments which could materially impact our results of operations.The increase in interest rates has substantially increased our borrowings costs and reduced our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms.  Additional increases in interest rates could have a significant unfavorable impact on our future results of operations and the resulting effect on the capital markets could adversely affect our ability to carry out our strategy.We believe that adjusted net income attributable to UHS, adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share, EBITDA net of NCI and Adjusted EBITDA net of NCI, which are non-GAAP financial measures (""GAAP"" is Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America), are helpful to our investors as measures of our operating performance. In addition, we believe that, when applicable, comparing and discussing our financial results based on these measures, as calculated, is helpful to our investors since it neutralizes the effect of material items impacting our net income attributable to UHS, such as, changes in the market value of shares of certain equity securities and other potential material items that are nonrecurring or non-operational in nature including, but not limited to, impairments of goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, reserves for various matters including settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, costs related to extinguishment of debt, gains/losses on sales of assets and businesses, potential impacts of non-ordinary acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic transactions, and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods. To obtain a complete understanding of our financial performance these measures should be examined in connection with net income attributable to UHS, as determined in accordance with GAAP, and as presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in this report or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 and our Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Since the items included or excluded from these measures are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance under GAAP, these measures should not be considered to be alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or profitability. Since these measures, as presented, are not determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating our financial performance. Universal Health Services, Inc.Consolidated Statements of Income(in thousands, except per share

Though, with more than 24,000 water service lines currently identified as needing replacement and many more yet to be identified, New Jersey American Water is calling on customers and stakeholders to help speed up progress.In July 2021, New Jersey enacted a law requiring all water providers to replace both utility-owned and customer-owned lead and galvanized service lines by 2031. In response to this law, in January 2022, New Jersey American Water published a robust, interactive webpage and map, located at newjerseyamwater.com/leadfacts, to allow customers to view the service line material of their property.Historically, the material of customer-owned water service lines has not been tracked by water utilities, so completing an inventory of customer-owned service lines is a necessary first step towards replacing all lead or galvanized water service lines.Recently, the company launched an education campaign about the Lead Service Line Replacement Program with resources for customers, including a step-by-step tutorial showing how to self-identify pipe material and a convenient portal to submit findings. Customers with water service lines confirmed as needing replacement will then need to sign an agreement authorizing New Jersey American Water to complete the necessary work.""In just one year, our Lead Service Line Replacement Program has made a significant difference across our service areas in New Jersey. But, with thousands of lines left to be replaced, and many more that have yet to be identified, we’re counting on the continued support of our customers, elected officials, and community partners to help us get this done quickly and efficiently,"" said Mark McDonough, President, New Jersey American Water. ""We’ll do all the work — all we need customers to do is identify their service line material using our online portal, and if it’s confirmed to be lead or galvanized steel, sign the agreement giving our contractors permission to complete the replacement.""Story continuesIn addition to resources currently available through its education campaign, New Jersey American Water will be stepping up outreach in early August by launching a toolkit and hosting a webinar to arm stakeholders, elected officials, and partners with more resources to help spread the word, educate and engage customers across their service area.""For this effort to truly be successful, we need everyone to ‘pipe up’ and tell us what their service lines are made of, so we can work together to get the lead out of New Jersey, once and for all,"" said McDonough.As the company and customers continue to identify lead and galvanized service lines, New Jersey American Water will notify property owners via letters as required by law annually until their lead or galvanized service line is replaced. This notification will follow the company’s annual July inventory submission to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.It is important to note that if a customer’s service lines contain lead, it does not mean they cannot use water as they normally do. New Jersey American Water regularly tests for lead in drinking water and the water delivered to customers meets state and federal water quality regulations, including those set for lead.For more information on this program, and lead and drinking water, please visit www.newjerseyamwater.com/leadfacts.About New Jersey American WaterNew Jersey American Water, a subsidiary of American Water (NYSE: AWK), is the largest investor-owned water utility in the state, providing high-quality and reliable water and wastewater services to approximately 2.8 million people.

It marked a slowdown from a 4% increase in May.After hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, inflation has slowed for 12 straight months.Consumer inflation has fallen to its lowest annual rate in over two years. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (Joe Raedle via Getty Images)David Kelley, JP Morgan Asset Management's chief global strategist, says inflation is likely to move ""sideways"" for the rest of the year and decline in 2024.""Net, net, inflation isn’t dead. But the extraordinary pandemic push on prices from shortages and shift to stay-at-home purchases is clearly over, and the Fed for the first time has the upper hand in its inflation fight,"" pointed out MUFG's chief economist, Chris Rupkey.So is corporate America seeing the same narrative around inflation as Mr. Market is rallying behind?Here's what four top execs who control companies with more than $400 billion in market value just told Yahoo Finance Live about the state of inflation.Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo CFOMarket Cap: $263 billion""The fact that commodities have moderated, they're still inflationary. And I suspect even as we go into next year, commodities will still be inflationary. And with that, prices will still increase. Now, the rate of increase will come down, but the prices will still increase certainly into next year. We'll see how the balance of the year plays its way out.""James Peters, Whirlpool CFOMarket Cap: $8 billion""From a material cost perspective, we saw the peak late last year. If we look at our costs, our logistics costs have come down. Labor is one cost where I would say inflation has steadied. It's at a more typical rate. Obviously, I don't think labor costs will come back down. We saw a $300 million to $400 million deflation in materials costs. I do believe at least for our business, inflation has peaked.""Story continuesLeon Topalian, Nucor CEOMarket Cap: $43 billion""I would tell you that we're a margin business. And so, at the end of the day, we're not immune to some of the influxes of the supplies and services [inflation]. But most of our uses are coming within the United States, or certainly within North America. So we did not have the exposure to other nations and other countries like some manufacturing sectors did.""So I think by and large, that's [inflation] tamed and certainly, again, part of our mix as we predict and estimate for the rest of the year. We think it'll be a good, very solid year for Nucor.""Stephen Squeri, American Express CEOMarket Cap: $123 billion""I see us continuing to perform as the environment stays like this, and to be honest, I don't see the environment changing very much. I think inflation will continue to tick slightly. You might have a little interest rate raise, but I don't see things falling off the cliff.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

We’ve received many positive surprises throughout the period as companies navigate a unique macroeconomic situation. In fact, four companies – PepsiCo PEP, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, General Electric GE, and ASML Holding ASML – have all delivered a beat-and-raise quarter. Let’s take a closer look at each’s quarterly results and guidance upgrades.PepsiCoConsumer staples titan PepsiCo exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by a strong 7% and reported revenue more than 3% ahead of expectations thanks to strong consumer demand and continued business momentum. Earnings saw growth of 13%, whereas revenue climbed 10% from the year-ago quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor the company’s FY23, PEP expects to deliver 10% organic revenue growth (8% previously) and 12% core EPS growth (9% previously). PepsiCo has enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions across several periods following the release, with the stock sporting a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares saw a nice move post-earnings, with PEP shares gaining roughly 2%.Johnson &amp; JohnsonJohnson &amp; Johnson’s quarterly results came in nicely above expectations, with the company exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by more than 7% and delivering a positive 3% revenue surprise. Quarterly revenue totaled $25.5 billion, seeing a 6% improvement from the year-ago period.Like PEP, the company’s top line has remained steady.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFollowing the better-than-expected results, JNJ raised its FY23 adjusted EPS guidance, expecting a profit of $10.70 – $10.80 per share ($10.60 – $10.70 previously). Positive earnings estimate revisions unsurprisingly followed, with the Zacks Consensus EPS FY23 estimate of $10.73 up nearly 1% since the end of June. The stock is now a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The results impressed the market, with JNJ shares closing 6% higher post-earnings.Story continuesASML HoldingASML posted EPS of $5.37, 8% ahead of our consensus estimate and improving a solid 42% from the year-ago period. The semiconductor player posted 2023 Q2 revenues of $7.5 billion, 30% higher year-over-year. Despite posting solid year-over-year growth, ASML shares faced selling pressure post-earnings, perhaps reflecting profit-taking among investors. Following the results, ASML forecasts FY23 net sales to grow roughly 30%, above the previously guided 25%. In addition, the company is mindful of macroeconomic uncertainties but believes that its strong backlog provides a buffer against headwinds.The company has seen positive earnings estimate revisions across its current fiscal year and next, helping land the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGeneral ElectricGeneral Electric delivered a highly favorable report, beating earnings expectations by a sizable 48% and reporting revenue of $16.7 billion. The company witnessed double-digit growth in orders, revenue, operating profit, and cash, topping off the robust results with a guidance upgrade.GE expects organic revenue growth in the low-double-digit range, up from the previously guided high-single-digit expectation.

Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and adjustments for other income and interest on operating lease liabilities) is considered non-GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the Company's ability to sustain given debt levels (including leases) with the cash generated from operations. In addition, a comparable measure is used by rating agencies when reviewing the Company's credit rating. Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is debt to net income ratio. The tables above provide a reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA, debt to adjusted debt, and debt to net income to adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA.

We are particularly encouraged by revenue growth in our base business of nearly ten percent from our health system customers.""""Also in the second quarter we made substantial progress improving the profitability of our base business compared to the first quarter and prior year, despite persistently high employee turnover, which weighs on productivity and increases costs.""Mr. Davis continued: ""Our updated guidance reflects our expectations for revenue growth and improved profitability in the base business while we continue to operate in a tight labor market."" Three Months Ended June 30,Six Months Ended June 30,20232022Change20232022Change(dollars in millions, except per share data)Reported:Net revenues$       2,338$       2,453(4.7) %$     4,669$     5,064(7.8) %Base business revenues (a)$       2,297$       2,0989.5 %$     4,509$     4,1109.7 %COVID-19 testing revenues$            41$          355(88.3) %$         160$         954(83.2) %Diagnostic Information Services revenues$       2,268$       2,384(4.9) %$     4,527$     4,925(8.1) %Revenue per requisition(4.9) %(6.3) %Requisition volume0.2 %(1.8) %  Organic requisition volume(0.3) %(2.1) %Operating income (b)$          348$          388(10.1) %$         653$         901(27.5) %Operating income as a percentage of net revenues (b)14.9 %15.8 %(0.9) %14.0 %17.8 %(3.8) %Net income attributable to Quest Diagnostics (b)$          235$          234— %$         437$         589(25.8) %Diluted EPS (b)$         2.05$         1.964.6 %$        3.83$        4.88(21.5) %Cash provided by operations $          444$          40210.4 %$         538$         882(39.1) %Capital expenditures$          104$            7636.3 %$         231$         13965.8 %Adjusted (b):Operating income$          389$          435(10.4) %$         739$         989(25.2) %Operating income as a percentage of net revenues16.7 %17.7 %(1.0) %15.8 %19.5 %(3.7) %Net income attributable to Quest Diagnostics$          263$          281(6.8) %$         495$         673(26.5) %Diluted EPS$         2.30$         2.36(2.5) %$        4.34$        5.58(22.2) %(a) Excludes COVID-19 testing.(b)  For further details impacting the year-over-year comparisons related to operating income, operating income as a percentage of net revenues, net income attributable to Quest Diagnostics, and diluted EPS, see note 2 of the financial tables attached below. Story continuesUpdated Guidance for Full Year 2023The company updates its Full Year 2023 guidance as follows: Updated GuidancePrior GuidanceLowHighLowHighNet revenues$9.12 billion$9.22 billion$8.93 billion$9.08 billionNet revenues decrease(7.7) %(6.7) %(9.6) %(8.1) %Base business revenues (a)$8.92 billion$9.02 billion$8.78 billion$8.88 billionBase business revenues increase5.8 %7.0 %4.2 %5.4 %COVID-19 testing revenuesApproximately $200 million$150 million$200 millionCOVID-19 testing revenues decrease(86.2) %(89.7) %(86.2) %Reported diluted EPS$7.52$7.92$7.52$8.02Adjusted diluted EPS$8.50$8.90$8.45$8.95Cash provided by operationsAt least $1.3 billionAt least $1.3 billionCapital expenditures  Approximately $400 millionApproximately $400 million(a) Excludes COVID-19 testing Note on Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAs used in this press release the term ""reported"" refers to measures under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP""). The term ""adjusted"" refers to non-GAAP operating performance measures that exclude special items such as restructuring and integration charges, amortization expense, excess tax benefits (""ETB"") associated with stock-based compensation, costs associated with donations, contributions, and other financial support through Quest for Health Equity (our initiative with the Quest Diagnostics Foundation to reduce health disparities in underserved communities), gains and losses associated with changes in the carrying value of our strategic investments, and other items.Non-GAAP adjusted measures are presented because management believes those measures are useful adjuncts to GAAP results. Non-GAAP adjusted measures should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under GAAP. Management may use these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and analysts to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, as well as to analyze the underlying trends in our business and to assess our performance.

532,20165a84-ff60-3f4a-84aa-6dfe70ffa00b,DGX,2023-07-26,"MedTech Stocks' Q2 Earnings Due on Jul 26: DGX, TMO and More",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtech-stocks-q2-earnings-due-150500123.html,1690297500,STORY,"['DGX', 'EW', 'TMO', 'ALGN']","[The second-quarter earnings season for the Medical sector has kicked off. Per the latest Earnings Preview, quarterly results so far have improved year over year despite the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in the form of worldwide inflationary pressure and unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. Going by the sector’s scorecard, 3.4% of the companies in the Medical sector, constituting 12.3% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings till Jul 19. Of these, 100% beat earnings and revenue estimates. Earnings improved 9.3% year over year on 14% higher revenues.However, overall, second-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to plunge 18.6% despite 3.4% revenue growth. This compares with the first-quarter earnings decline of 17.9% on revenue growth of 4%.The projection reflects the ongoing global inflationary pressure, which has resulted in an extremely tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, putting the industry in a tight spot again. The majority of the players within this space witnessed a rise in raw material costs and other expense pressure through the second-quarter months. Added to this, labor-supply constraints due to an increase in labor costs and global supply-chain hazards are expected to have moderated the growth process.MedTech Quarterly SynopsysReplicating the market-wide trend, MedTech or the Zacks-defined Medical Products companies’ collective business growth in the second quarter is likely to have been significantly dampened by the ongoing macroeconomic threat in the United States and outside. Through the second-quarter months, the companies, which are into international trade, are expected to have faced severe currency headwind. During this period, the U.S. dollar remained strong compared to several foreign currencies, which is expected to have had an unfavorable impact on sales.Further, in Medical Device, going by the industry-wide trend, logistical challenges and increasing unit costs are likely to have weighed heavily on the corporate profitability of stocks across the board. On the other hand, the tightened monetary policy starkly altered consumer preferences and once again put the demand for the non-essential category line of medical device businesses on the back foot. This might have, in a way, shrunk the companies’ revenues in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter.Story continuesAlso, diagnostic testing companies might have shown a severe year-over-year decline in testing demand, compared to a strong comparison in the year-ago period on the rise in new cases in select geographies.Medical device companies like Quest Diagnostics DGX, Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO, Edwards Lifesciences EW and Align Technology ALGN are likely to have been influenced by these abovementioned factors in the second quarter.On a positive note, companies’ successful addressing of a couple of years’ pent-up demand is likely to have led to higher year-over-year growth within the legacy base businesses. During the post-pandemic phase, the key focus of medical device R&amp;D has again shifted from COVID-related PPE, testing and distant care options to point-of-care testing, heavy as well as minimally invasive implants, elective procedures and so forth. Accordingly, legacy base business recovery and testing demand of the companies through the months of the second quarter are expected to have been impressive. Meanwhile, AI and robotics for the medical Internet of Things (IoT), which rose to the limelight during the pandemic phase, remained popular.Let's take a look at four MedTech players scheduled to announce second-quarter results on Jul 26.Quest Diagnostics: During the first quarter of 2023, Quest Diagnostics’ COVID-19 testing revenues nosedived to a large extent, with the continuous decline in testing volumes. The company witnessed a downward trend in the demand for COVID-19 molecular testing volumes earlier than anticipated. For the remaining half of the year, Quest Diagnostics’ revised guidance assumes modest COVID-19 revenues following the end of the public health emergency in May. This is likely to be reflected in the second-quarter results.(Read more: Quest Diagnostics to Post Q2 Earnings: What's in Store?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $2.24 billion for the second quarter suggests an 8.6% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for DGX’s earnings of $2.23 per share indicates a 5.5% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Per our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates. This is not the case as you can see below.DGX has an Earnings ESP of -0.95% and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

The company is expected to have recorded growth, driven by a favorable business mix and new launches. The launch of Invitrogen DynaGreen — microplastic-free magnetic beads for protein purification — backed by strong customer adoption, is also expected to have contributed to the second-quarter top line.(Read more: What's in Store for Thermo Fisher in Q2 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Thermo Fisher’s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $10.99 billion, which implies a rise of 0.2% from the year-ago figure. The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $5.43, suggesting a fall of 1.45% from the prior-year reported figure.TMO has an Earnings ESP of +0.21% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. price-eps-surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

AMP may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Ameriprise is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AMP in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $7.30 per share for AMP, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.29 per share.
