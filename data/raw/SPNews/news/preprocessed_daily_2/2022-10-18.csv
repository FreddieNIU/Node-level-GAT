Insurance and reinsurance companies can use these projections to investigate how future climate change may impact their full distribution of modeled loss, including not only average annual losses (AALs) but key return period metrics that inform underwriting and risk transfer strategies.“Insurers, reinsurers, corporations and investors are all actively working to assess the impacts of climate change on their portfolios as they respond to stakeholders and manage their business,” noted Bill Churney, president of Extreme Event Solutions at Verisk. “Our climate change solutions help them understand the growing risks and rising losses from the physical damage and liability aspects of climate change, enabling them to thoughtfully prepare operational and strategic resilience initiatives that meet the needs of all stakeholders.”Verisk climate scientists developed the projections with a thorough review of the latest international research and simulations of hurricanes based on nine different general circulation models (GCMs). This unique methodology provides an ensemble view of GCM results with physics-based, high-resolution simulations that more accurately represent how future hurricanes may form, intensify and move.The climate change projections can be leveraged to assess future losses for residential, commercial/industrial, manufactured (mobile) homes and automobile lines of business. The results have a variety of use cases, including:Story continuesResponding to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) reporting and regulatory climate disclosure requirements such as Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and other regulatory bodies globallyStress-testing and rebalancing portfoliosImproving climate risk insights and streamlining reporting to stakeholders and investorsGaining peril-specific insights that inform mitigation and adaptation strategies“Catastrophe models have been developed to model the financial impacts of extreme weather. By frequently updating catastrophe models and applying a probabilistic modeling approach, Verisk extreme event models are designed to reflect a near-present (0-10 year) view of climate risk,” said Dr. Peter Sousounis, vice president and director of climate change research, Verisk Extreme Event Solutions. “Our projections for the longer-term (10+ years) view of risk leverage a unique methodology where we downscale the results of high-resolution GCMs.”The projections are part of a wide range of climate change and ESG solutions that Verisk offers for assessing climate risk and informing adaptation efforts across different sectors of the insurance industry and the global economy. Verisk businesses provide robust data sets and tools for managing climate change risks and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) concerns.

The bottom line also soared 31% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for adjusted earnings was $1.02 per share.The stock jumped 3.4% in pre-market trading, reflecting investors’ bullish sentiments over its better-than-expected quarterly performance. The full-day trading session will display a clearer picture. Results benefited from higher rates, which led to a rise in net interest income (NII). Thus, revenues witnessed an improvement despite higher volatility hurting trading income. Also, the absence of fee waivers and solid brokerage account numbers acted as tailwinds during the quarter. However, higher expenses were a headwind.Results excluded acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangibles. After considering these, net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $1.88 billion or 99 cents per share, up from $1.41 billion or 74 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. We had projected earnings per share (GAAP basis) of 91 cents.Revenues &amp; Expenses RiseNet revenues were $5.5 billion, which grew 20% year over year. The increase was mainly driven by a 44% surge in NII and a 28% rise in bank deposit fees. The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.40 billion. Our estimate for the metric was $5.38 billion.Total non-interest expenses (GAAP basis) increased 10% to $2.82 billion. We had projected this metric to be $2.97 billion. Excluding non-recurring items, expenses were $2.57 billion, up 12%.The company recorded no fee waivers in the quarter compared with $83 million in the prior-year quarter. Pre-tax profit margin increased to 48.7% from 44% in the prior-year quarter.

The company is facing the rising COVID-19 cases in China which continues to remain a serious headwind. We note that the pandemic-led disruptions are likely to persist as concerns for Alibaba’s domestic businesses.However, solid momentum across China and International wholesale businesses is benefiting its China and International commerce businesses, respectively. We expect China commerce and international commerce to be up 6.5% and 8.6% in fiscal 2023 year over year, respectively.Further, strength across the local consumer services, cloud computing business and Cainiao logistics services is contributing well to the top-line growth. Also, well-performing direct sales businesses like Alibaba Health and Freshippo remain tailwinds. Considering these factors, our estimates suggest that the top-line is likely to witness a 2.7% rise in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022.Story continues(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here &gt;&gt;&gt;)NextEra Energy shares have held up very well relative to the turmoil in the broader market, but they modestly underperformed the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry over the past year (-10.5% vs. -7.6%). The nature of its business is subject to complex federal, state and other regulations. Unfavorable weather conditions and an increase in supply costs adversely impact earnings as well.Nevertheless, through the proper execution of organic projects and strategic acquisitions, it is expanding its operations. NextEra Energy currently has a lot of renewable projects in its backlog and the renewable project backlog is rising every quarter, which is aiding the company in cutting emissions.The merger of Gulf Power and FPL strengthens NextEra Energy’s position in Florida.

Further, intensifying market competition and coronavirus related uncertainties are concerns.However, Texas Instruments is benefiting from a solid rebound in the automotive market. Further, a solid demand environment in the industrial, communication equipment and enterprise systems markets is a major positive. Additionally, solid momentum across the Analog segment owing to robust signal chain and power product lines, is contributing well to the top line.Also, the robust Embedded Processing segment is contributing well.

These are companies that growth revenue and, or profits at a faster rate than the broader market. At the same time, they provide dividend payments, enabling a best-of-both-worlds.As for ultimate growth potential, these under the radar dividend growth stocks may have the potential to create double-digit gains over the next year or two. Some market ideas might take a bit longer than others, simply based on their underlying industry. Nevertheless, these ideas bring balance to the table. If you don’t know what direction to go, grab both capital gains and income with these under the radar dividend growth stocks.WSOWatsco$241.47AOSA.O.

Unfortunately, this narrative hasn’t helped WSO much, with shares dropping almost 16% on a year-to-date basis. Still, this company which usually lurks in the shadows makes for one of the best under the radar dividend growth stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFirst, let’s talk about the passive income. According to Dividend.com, WSO features a forward yield of 3.43%. This compares favorably to the Dow Jones Industrials average yield of 2.12%. Moreover, Watsco has nine years of consecutive dividend increases. Second, the financials really shine for Watsco. Owning robust strengths across the board, the company has higher-than-average performance stats for revenue expansion and profitability. Plus, the industrial equipment and products firm has a return on equity of 27.3%. This compares favorably to nearly 88% of the competition, making WSO a high-quality business.Story continuesLooking ahead, WSO should easily move 10% higher from the current price over the next two years.A.O. Smith (AOS)A photo of small bubbles in a container of water.Source: khak/ShutterStock.comA.O. Smith (NYSE:AOS) enjoys a reputation as one of the world’s leading providers of water heating and water treatment solutions. Given the pertinence of its underlying business, A.O. Smith benefits from some magnitude of inelastic demand. Still, this framework has not been beneficial for AOS stock, which slipped over 41% since the start of this year.Nevertheless, AOS may qualify for one of the best under the radar dividend growth stocks to buy, at least for patient investors. First, A.O. Smith features a forward yield of 2.29%. To be fair, this metric slips slightly lower than the Industrials average yield of 2.12%. However, the company enjoys 30 years of consecutive dividend increases. That’s certainly not a status A.O. Smith will give up without a fight.On the financials, the company enjoys strong growth and earnings trajectories. For instance, its three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate stands at 18.4%, ranking better than nearly 65% of the competition. Even better, A.O. Smith has a return on equity of 28%, reflecting a high-quality business (like Watsco above).Moving forward, AOS easily has the potential to rise 10% quickly should economic conditions normalize.Texas Instruments (TXN)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally. Unfortunately, the global supply chain disruption, stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, meant that TXN struggled this year. Still, it’s not a horrific outing for Texas Instruments, with shares down 19% YTD.If you can overlook the double-digit losses, which again isn’t that bad compared to the Nasdaq Composite’s performance, you might come away with the impression that TXN represents one of the under-the-radar dividend growth stocks to buy. First, the company carries a forward yield of 3.2%. This contrasts favorably with the technology sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, TXN enjoys 18 years of consecutive dividend increases.What’s more, Texas Instruments features myriad financial strengths across the board. Along with solid growth and excellent profitability metrics when stacked up against the semiconductor industry, TXN’s return on equity pings at 66%. That’s above nearly 99% of its peers, reflecting incredible quality.Once circumstances normalize, you’re looking at TXN being up 20% from here easily and quickly.Infosys (INFY)Source: ShutterstockInfosys (NYSE:INFY) provides business consulting, information technology and outsourcing services. Further, the underlying region represents a major growth market. Experts project that the Indian economy will expand at an average real GDP growth rate of 6% between 2022 and 2030. Sadly, this compelling potential fails to convince Wall Street. Since the beginning of this year, INFY fell over 28%.Still, investors with a long-term view should consider INFY as one of the under-the-radar dividend growth stocks to buy. On the passive income side, Infosys carries a forward yield of 2.25%. Though not the highest figure in town, it does rank better than the tech sector’s average yield. At the same time, Infosys doesn’t have a long track record of consecutive dividend increases so it’s something to note.On the financials, it’s tough to beat Infosys. No matter where you look (balance sheet, revenue trajectories, earnings performances) INFY simply features a stacked profile. Significantly, the company has a return on equity of 31%, reflect top-notch business quality.If you believe in the India upside narrative, INFY could be good for a 20% jump in two years’ time.Sapiens International (SPNS)software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecuritySource: ShutterstockSapiens International (NASDAQ:SPNS) develops computer software for the insurance industry. One of the fundamental drivers for SPNS is that generally speaking, insurance providers feature inelastic demand. No matter what’s going on with the economy, people need financial protection. However, as with other under-the-radar dividend growth stocks, the business narrative hasn’t helped in 2022.SPNS shares fell a staggering 48%. Further, volatility has yet to die down, with the security declining over 11% in the trailing month. That said, Sapiens has a forward yield of 2.56%. Again, that’s conspicuously above the technology sector’s average yield of 1.37%. To be fair, though, the company only has two years of consecutive dividend increases.For those looking for a great deal, Gurufocus.com labels SPNS significantly undervalued. It’s the same story with the other under-the-radar dividend growth stocks on this list. Sapiens benefits from above-sector-average growth and profitability metrics. Plus, the company features a return on equity of 13.4%, a very solid figure representing a quality business.Certainly, SPNS requires some broader market stabilization. Once that happens, SPNS could easily fly higher 10% to 20%, if not more.McGrath RentCorp (MGRC)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockMcGrath RentCorp (NASDAQ:MGRC) represents a diversified business-to-business rental company. Primarily, the company rents and sells relocatable modular buildings, storage containers and offices, electronic test equipment, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Featuring everyday commercial relevance, Wall Street finally rewarded one of these under-the-radar dividend growth stocks. Since the start of this year, MGRC gained 6%.The hope here is that shares continue to rise steadily higher. Fundamentally, it can achieve this goal because of its 2.15% forward yield. No, it’s not the most generous yield. It’s even well below the real estate average yield of 4.46%. However, McGrath also brings the growth component to the mix, facilitating balanced reassurances for prospective stakeholders.Now, about that growth. Data from Gurufocus.com reveals that McGrath’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 7.4%. Further, its three-year book growth rate is 8.5%. Both rank better than at least 60% of the competition. As well, the company’s return on equity pings at 13.3%, superior to 64% of the industry.Looking ahead, MGRC is a bit of a slower mover in the market. However, the combo of growth and yield make it one of the better names among under-the-radar dividend growth stocks.United Parcel Service (UPS)Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.Source: monticello / ShutterstockUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) long represented a vital cog in the global supply chain network. Sadly, though, this very narrative presents significant risks to the courier service. With a major rival recently disclosing negative impacts from macroeconomic headwinds, it’s possible that UPS could succumb to similar pressures.For now, the company is doing its best to hold on, although shares did slip over 23% since the start of the year. Nevertheless, for those that are willing to take risks, UPS may offer an enticing profile among under-the-radar dividend growth stocks. Per Dividend.com, the company offers a forward yield of 3.72%. That’s higher than the broader Industrials average yield of 2.12%.Despite wider fundamental concerns, UPS enjoys overall strong financials. For instance, the company’s three-year book growth rate stands at 66.9%, better than nearly 98% of the competition. As well, UPS has a return on equity of 79.5%, ranked better than 96% of its peers.Predicting chart growth presents vagaries since UPS ties in with macro dynamics. Still, if circumstances normalize, it should be good for at least 10% growth in the next year or two.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

To ignore our industry introduction, and to jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, head on over to 5 Technology Stocks To Buy That Are Too Cheap To Ignore. Taking a look at the broad stock market, which consists of a myriad of sectors such as construction, industrial, agriculture, and furniture, one of the strongest growing sectors is technology. Spurred by the advances in chip fabrication, today's computing devices are vastly more powerful than those just two decades back. These have driven a variety of technology industries, ranging from enterprise computing to the metaverse.For investors looking to profit from this growth, this year's stock market bloodbath spurred by rapid interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve can provide the perfect opportunity to buy shares. This is simply due to the fact that the share prices that have dropped are due to the general macroeconomic environment and not because of underlying problems with the companies themselves.The trend in technology stocks can be explained better by no one other than the billionaire Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments. The investor recently outlined that:. . .that means when we get to the bottom whenever that is, you should expect to see tech, because it's been lagging, because we've had more down days than up this year, which you know by definition since we've had a down year in 2022 through the middle of the summer. You should expect to see it leading once we hit that bear market bottom and start on the other side. Now I don't want to argue with you in this video about direction of the market, I do want to say once you get down this far into a bear market, it is not terribly long in time until you normally get to a bottom. We can debate what that is, but once you get into the bottom, you should see tech leading for about the next year. And therefore, and maybe longer, but for about the next year. And therefore, we should be seeing most of the next year led by tech going up. I want to step back and reiterate, market down, tech down more. Market up, tech up more. Correlation to that is so high and yet not widely perceived by people. I've not seen anything stated on this in public anywhere, but it's a simple, unseen fact. And facts are stubborn things. And the stubbornness of that ripples over into this feature, that I just articulated. As categories, not individual stocks, categories. Falls the most in bear markets, bounces the most for a good long time coming off the bottom. And you should expect that with tech as we hit a bottom, when we hit a bottom.Story continuesBuilding upon Mr. Fisher's thoughts, research firm Research and Markets believes that the global information technology market was worth $7.8 trillion in 2020, and despite this size, it will still grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 9% to sit at a whopping $11 trillion in 2025.Today's piece will focus on the cheap technology stocks that are easy to invest in, and some companies likely to catch your attention include Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 2.65%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.86%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.24%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the independent oil and gas company had lost 9.36% over the past month. This has lagged the Oils-Energy sector's loss of 4.88% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 8.99% in that time.Range Resources will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 24, 2022. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.40, up 169.23% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.07 billion, up 252% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $5.41 per share and revenue of $4.06 billion. These totals would mark changes of +167.82% and +38.43%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Range Resources. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.66% lower. Range Resources is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Range Resources is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 4.98. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 4.98, so we one might conclude that Range Resources is trading at a no noticeable deviation comparatively.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that RRC currently has a PEG ratio of 0.18. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. RRC's industry had an average PEG ratio of 0.23 as of yesterday's close.The Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 31, putting it in the top 13% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

15,68938fba-904a-31aa-a8cc-587e617de457,RRC,2022-10-18,Range Resources (RRC) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/range-resources-rrc-reports-next-140002152.html,1666015202,STORY,['RRC'],"[The market expects Range Resources (RRC) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis independent oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.40 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +169.2%.Revenues are expected to be $1.07 billion, up 252% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.96% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Range Resources?For Range Resources, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.43%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Range Resources will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Range Resources would post earnings of $1.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.27, delivering a surprise of +4.96%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Range Resources appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The negative inventory numbers, coupled with other factors, meant that futures fell for the eighth week in a row to settle at its lowest level in almost three months.Despite this, the market has been kind to natural gas in 2022, with the commodity trading considerably higher year to date and hitting $10 for the first time since 2008. Natural gas stocks like EQT Corporation EQT, Comstock Resources CRK and Range Resources RRC have been some of the prime beneficiaries of the price appreciation.EIA Reports a Build Larger Than Market ExpectationsStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose 125 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Oct 7, exceeding the guidance of a 123 Bcf addition per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.The increase was also well above last year’s injection of 86 Bcf for the same corresponding week and the five-year (2017-2021) average net build of 82 Bcf.The latest increment puts total natural gas stocks at 3,231 Bcf, which is still 126 Bcf (3.8%) below the 2021 level at this time and 221 Bcf (6.4%) lower than the five-year average.The total supply of natural gas averaged 105.4 Bcf per day, down 1.1 Bcf per day on a weekly basis due to a dip in dry production (from its record level) and lower shipments from CanadaMeanwhile, daily consumption rose 1.8% to 91.3 Bcf from 89.7 Bcf in the previous week, mainly reflecting a stronger power burn and increased residential/commercial demand.Natural Gas Logs its Eighth Straight Weekly FallNatural gas prices tumbled last week, following the higher-than-expected inventory build. Futures for November delivery ended Friday at $6.453 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, falling around 4.4% from the previous week’s closing. The decrease in natural gas realization — for the eighth straight week — is also the result of a boom in supplies and the prediction of mild ‘shoulder season’ weather.As is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. The latest models anticipate light temperature-driven consumption over the near term (with little use of air conditioning or heater across much of the Lower 48), which is a negative for prices.An increase in natural gas production has also kept the commodity in check. With the upstream operators finally responding to price incentives and ramping up volumes in the last two months, daily production has topped or hovered around 100 Bcf in recent weeks. This wave of new supply is expected to largely neutralize concerns that the market might enter the winter withdrawal season with gas in storage well below normal. Having said that, current inventories are still pretty tight and remain more than 6% below their five-year average.The one thing supporting natural gas is a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries. LNG shipments for export from the United States have been robust for months on the back of environmental reasons and record-high prices of the super-chilled fuel elsewhere. Now, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, LNG has become even more coveted. As a matter of fact, earlier this year, the United States entered into a partnership with the EU to export additional LNG to wean the bloc off its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies. This means LNG deliveries are poised to rise further, especially with natural gas supplies from Moscow to Europe squeezed following leaks in the key Nord Stream pipeline.However, the protracted downtime associated with the fire breakout at the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas has drowned out most of the positives as of now. The Quintana, TX facility — responsible for around 15% of U.S. liquefaction capacity — was knocked offline by the Jun 8 blast and is expected to only partially restart in November. Consequently, some of the LNG cargoes due for export are likely to have been diverted to the domestic market despite huge demand abroad.Story continuesFinal ThoughtsDespite posting an eighth straight down week with combined losses of around 30% during this period, the natural gas market is still up almost 75% so far this year. As one would expect, the loss in momentum since mid-August has also pushed gas stocks down. However, certain companies like EQT, Comstock Resources and Range Resources have handsomely benefited from the windfall from higher natural gas prices year to date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research EQT: EQT is primarily an explorer and producer of natural gas, with a primary focus on the Appalachian Basin in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In terms of average daily sales volumes, EQT is the largest natural gas producer in the domestic market.The company, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has an expected earnings growth rate of 365.2% for the current year.

NUE, Steel Dynamics, Inc. STLD and Ternium S.A. TX.Industry: Steel ProductionLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1992538/3-steel-producer-stocks-to-escape-industry-challengesThe Zacks Steel Producers industry has lost momentum as steel prices have witnessed a sharp downward correction after catapulting to historic highs last year. Weaker demand across certain markets, including automotive, lower raw material costs and new capacity have contributed to the downswing in steel prices. Soft demand in China is also a concern.However, a resilient non-residential construction market and demand recovery in the energy space augur well for the industry. Industry players like Nucor Corp., Steel Dynamics, Inc. and Ternium S.A. are worth a look despite near-term headwinds.About the IndustryThe Zacks Steel Producers industry serves a vast spectrum of end-use industries such as automotive, construction, appliance, container, packaging, industrial machinery, mining equipment, transportation, and oil and gas with various steel products. These products include hot-rolled and cold-rolled coils and sheets, hot-dipped and galvanized coils and sheets, reinforcing bars, billets and blooms, wire rods, strip mill plates, standard and line pipe, and mechanical tubing products.Steel is primarily produced using two methods — Blast Furnace and Electric Arc Furnace. It is regarded as the backbone of the manufacturing industry. The automotive and construction markets have historically been the largest consumers of steel. Notably, the housing and construction sector is the biggest consumer of steel, accounting for roughly half of the world’s total consumption.What's Shaping the Future of the Steel Producers' Industry?Slumping Steel Prices to Hurt Margins: Steel prices staged a strong recovery and hit record levels last year on the back of an upturn in demand across key markets, tight supply conditions and low steel inventory throughout the supply chain. Notably, U.S. steel prices skyrocketed to all-time highs last year on supply tightness and robust demand.Story continuesThe benchmark hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices broke above the $1,900 per short ton level in August 2021 and eventually peaked in September. But prices have lost steam since last October due to the stabilization of demand, improved supply conditions and higher steel imports. HRC prices slumped to nearly $1,000 per short ton at the start of March 2022.Since Russia invaded Ukraine, steel prices significantly rebounded and surged to nearly $1,500 per short ton in April 2022 on supply worries and a spike in lead times. However, prices have retreated since then partly reflecting shorter lead times and fears of a recession. HRC prices have tumbled more than 45% since their April peak, falling below the $800 per short ton level.The declining cost of raw materials (including scrap prices) and the addition of new production capacity have also contributed to the downswing in U.S. HRC prices. Lower prices are expected to weigh on the profitability and cash flows of steel-producing companies over the near term.Slowdown in China a Cause for Concern: Steel demand in China, the world’s top consumer of the commodity, has softened since the second half of 2021 due to a slowdown in the country’s economy. A downturn in the country’s real estate sector contributed to the slowdown. New lockdowns are also taking a significant toll on the world’s second-largest economy.A slowdown in manufacturing activities has led to the contraction in demand for steel in China. The manufacturing sector has taken a beating as the virus resurgence has hurt demand for manufactured goods and supply chains. Beijing’s actions to take the heat out of its property market partly through credit tightening measures is also a concern for the country’s steel industry.Healthy Non-residential &amp; Energy Demand Masks Auto Weakness: Steel producers are exposed to challenges from softening demand across certain markets. Demand in the automotive market has weakened due to the semiconductor crunch, which is affecting automotive production.The Russia-Ukraine conflict has worsened the chip crisis. Weaker automotive production due to component shortages is likely to affect demand in this market over the near term. Supply issues have also affected demand in the appliances end-market. Macroeconomic uncertainties triggered by the war in Ukraine have also dwindled demand in Europe.Nevertheless, order activities in the non-residential construction market remain strong, underscoring the inherent strength of this industry. Demand in the energy sector has also improved on the back of an uptick in oil and gas prices. Favorable trends across these markets augur well for the steel industry.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Downbeat ProspectsThe Zacks Steel Producers industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #220, which places it at the bottom 12% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a gloomy near term.

18,85242bc2-593a-3f61-9c4e-660257626fb5,NUE,2022-10-18,Analysts Estimate Schnitzer Steel (SCHN) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-schnitzer-steel-schn-140002828.html,1666015202,STORY,"['SCHN', 'NUE']","[Schnitzer Steel (SCHN) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended August 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis recycler of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -73.5%.Revenues are expected to be $811.9 million, down 4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Schnitzer Steel?For Schnitzer Steel, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Schnitzer Steel will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Schnitzer Steel would post earnings of $2.28 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.59, delivering a surprise of +13.60%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Schnitzer Steel doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Steel - Producers industry, Nucor (NUE) is soon expected to post earnings of $6.45 per share for the quarter ended August 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -11.4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $10.06 billion, down 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Nucor has been revised 4.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nucor will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some more insurance stocks, go directly to 5 Best Insurance Stocks Under $70.The insurance sector has been one of the standout performers in a volatile marketplace in the United States over the past few months, demonstrating remarkable flexibility and resilience in overcoming a series of challenges, including the impact of the pandemic and the economic fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to a report by research firm Deloitte, this outperformance continues to be threatened by rising inflation, interest rates, loss costs, the looming threats of recession, climate change, and geopolitical upheaval. Some of the best insurance companies include Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), and MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET). Deloitte estimates that property-casualty price hikes were among the primary drivers pumping up premium volume and sending US consolidated surplus over the $1 trillion mark for the first time, even as inflation was driving loss costs even higher and faster in most markets. Per the research firm, as of May 12, average replacement costs were up 16.3% — nearly twice the Consumer Price Index rise. These numbers highlight the core contention that inflation is continuing to hamper non-life profitability even while boosting prices and top-line growth in the insurance industry. Research firm RSM claims that two key trends that investors should monitor in the space moving forward include artificial intelligence and machine learning. These, per RSM, can provide flexibility that allows insurers to innovate and transform faster. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the insurance sector and are trading at under $70 were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues10 Best Insurance Stocks Under $70austin-distel-jpHw8ndwJ_Q-unsplashBest Insurance Stocks Under $7010.

(NYSE:AEG), compared to 7 the preceding quarter worth $34.4 million.Just like Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), and MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), Aegon N.V.

The plan’s main goals are to diversify the company’s assets into a broader array of investments, including private debt through strategic partnerships, and to increase its use of reinsurance to free up capital. We think this is an interesting, but somewhat aggressive plan. Thus far, the results have been impressive, but we continue to monitor the credit quality of their assets as they move toward achieving their target of having 40% of their portfolio invested in private assets, up from 15.4%.”8.

Manulife offers a full suite of life insurance products as well as retirement and wealth management services. While the wealth management and retirement products appeal to the aging populations of the Western world, long-term life insurance products address the needs of the growing number of middle-class families in places like China and southeast Asia. COVID-19-induced lockdowns in China brought the shares down to a significant discount to our estimate of long-term value. The holding now serves as a nice diversifier to our Asia-centered insurers AIA and Ping An.”7. Unum Group (NYSE:UNM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25      Share Price as of October 13: $40.66  Unum Group (NYSE:UNM) provides financial protection benefit solutions primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland.

TMO is slated to release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 26, before market open.In the last reported quarter, Thermo Fisher’s earnings of $5.51 per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.9%. Its earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.5%.Let's discuss the factors that are likely to get reflected in the upcoming results.Factors at PlayThrough the months of the third quarter, Thermo Fisher’s Analytical Instruments segment is expected to have generated strong sales, banking on electron microscopy, chromatography, mass spectrometry, chemical analysis as well as the research and safety market channel businesses. The company is expected to have recorded growth, driven by a favorable business mix and new launches, including four new gas chromatography and GC-MS instruments to advance analytical testing for food, environmental, industrial, and pharmaceutical applications.Further, in terms of performance in high-growth and emerging markets, in the company’s flagship facility for cell culture media in Grand Island, NY, Thermo Fisher recently completed a capacity expansion to support customers' research, drug development, and production applications. Further, in its lab chemicals business in Geel, Belgium, the company completed a major expansion of the facility to support strong growth. These developments are expected to have contributed to the company’s revenues in Q3.However, supply issues and staffing shortages are expected to have deterred growth in a few areas within this business.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. price-eps-surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. QuotePer our model, this segment is expected to report revenues of $1.49 billion in Q3, up 15.2% year over year.Within the Life-Science Solutions segment, the company is expected to have registered strong growth in its bioproduction business, banking on progress with cell culture media, single-use technologies, and a rapidly growing purification resins business as well as the pharma services business. However, this might have been offset by lower revenues in the genetic sciences business due to a moderation in COVID testing revenues compared to the year-ago period.Story continuesOur model predicts Q3 segment revenues to be 3.24 billion, up 33% year over year.The Specialty Diagnostics segment (Clinical Diagnostics business from the molecular controls that go into testing kits) is expected to have registered positive contributions in the form of continued growth in the immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Looking at the consistently growing resurgence of the virus-led healthcare needs, the Microbiology, Healthcare Market Channel and Clinical Diagnostics businesses are expected to have witnessed strong growth in Q3. More specifically, the company’s strong underlying growth in the healthcare market channel, transplant diagnostics, and clinical diagnostics businesses are expected to have contributed to the to-be-reported quarter’s top line.Our model estimates Q3 segment revenues of $1.18 billion, up 12% year over year.Within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, the company is expected to have gained from strong productivity and volume leverage within the pharma services business and the research and safety market channel. Also, the PPD business in the research and safety market channel as well as plastics used in testing workflows and cold storage equipment manufactured by the lab products business are expected to have generated strong sales growth in the third quarter.We expect this segment to report revenues of $4.64 billion for Q3, up 33.2% year over year.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $9.86 billion for the third quarter suggests a 5.7% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings of $4.76 per share indicates a 17.4% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsPer our proven model, stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) have a good chance of beating estimates.

24,e0239c1d-6b2a-3194-8be2-cc25bc869fa4,TMO,2022-10-18,Is Now The Time To Look At Buying Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-thermo-140029671.html,1666015229,STORY,['TMO'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$604 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$501. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Thermo Fisher Scientific's current trading price of US$503 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Thermo Fisher Scientific’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific What's The Opportunity In Thermo Fisher Scientific?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 26.49x is currently trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 23.58x, which means if you buy Thermo Fisher Scientific today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe Thermo Fisher Scientific should be trading in this range, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. In addition to this, it seems like Thermo Fisher Scientific’s share price is quite stable, which could mean there may be less chances to buy low in the future now that it’s trading around the price multiples of other industry peers. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What kind of growth will Thermo Fisher Scientific generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Thermo Fisher Scientific's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in TMO’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at TMO? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on TMO, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for TMO, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

25,52a6da18-75c0-3904-b31a-1c33e3cf990d,TMO,2022-10-18,Top 10 Stock Picks of William Von Mueffling’s Cantillon Capital Management,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-10-stock-picks-william-131151829.html,1666012311,STORY,"['A', 'TMO', 'FIS', 'V', 'EFX', 'GOOGL']","[In this article, we discuss the top 10 stock picks of William Von Mueffling's Cantillon Capital Management. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Mueffling's investment philosophy and performance, go directly to Top 5 Stock Picks of William Von Mueffling's Cantillon Capital Management.William Von Mueffling worked at Lazard Asset Management before launching Cantillon Capital Management in 2003. He rose to fame while at Lazard Asset Management by posting 30% annualized returns during 1998-2003. That level of return during the extended market turmoil was made possible through timely short positions on several Internet high-fliers. Currently, he is the CEO and CIO of Cantillon Capital Management, an investment firm with more than $14 billion in assets under management.Mueffling used a traditional long/short strategy when he started Cantillon Capital Management. However, the hedge fund saw net withdrawals in 2008 as its funds experienced a loss. To everyone's surprise, he gave up shorting as an investment strategy the following year, highlighting how difficult it was to short when the government was creating money. Mueffling beat several other hedge funds, although his gains were still relatively small when assessed in terms of absolute returns. His hedge fund dropped 7%-8% up until May 2009.According to a Wall Street Journal story from 2010, Cantillon Capital Management's strategy is to look for businesses that deliver above-average returns on shareholder equity but are properly valued in relation to their income streams. Additionally, Mueffling stated in an interview with Graham &amp; Doddsville, the Columbia Business School newsletter:“One can broadly divide value investing into two camps. The first camp is the Graham &amp; Dodd style which is buying assets at a discount or cash at a discount. The second camp is the Buffett style, which I characterize as buying financial productivity at a discount. We fall into the second camp. We believe that there are many different types of moats to be found, and that a moat around a business should allow it to produce outsized margins and wonderful returns on capital. The trick is being able to buy this stream of cash flows at a discount. Unlike Graham &amp; Dodd investing where you might look at low price-to-book value companies or net-net companies, we are trying to buy high financial productivity at a discount to its intrinsic value.”Story continuesTop 10 Stock Picks of William von Mueffling's Cantillon Capital ManagementWilliam Von Mueffling of Cantillon Capital ManagementCantillon Capital Management announced 39 portfolio changes in the second quarter of 2022. The hedge fund made additional purchases in 10 stocks, acquired 2 new stocks, and reduced holdings in 27 equities. As a result, the number of total holdings increased from 37 to 39.

Visa processed 49.3 billion transactions on its network, up 16% year-on-year and 39% above pre-pandemic levels, driving $2.7 trillion in total payments volume, both of which have more than recovered from the impacts of the pandemic. The total number of cards in Visa’s network also grew by 8% year-on-year to 3.9 billion.Cross-border transactions were a key issue for Visa during the pandemic, but this headwind has now turned into a tailwind. Constant currency cross-border volumes rose 40% (48% excluding intra-Europe) in the most recent quarter and we expect this trend will continue to play out in the year ahead. While a potential economic slowdown and geopolitical concerns are always a risk, we take comfort in the fact that Visa has a sixty-plus year track record of successfully overcoming numerous macroeconomic challenges that in the moment appeared insurmountable. We believe this current episode will prove no different and that the combination of a very attractive industry structure and the ongoing secular shift towards digital payments provides a foundation that will enable Visa to continue winning for many years to come.”6.

First Eagle Investment Management was one of the company's leading stakeholders in Q2.Ariel Investments mentioned The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Rising interest rates, after a surprisingly long period of low absolute rates and negative “real” rates, will create a headwind. While there has been much debate about the cause of these low rates, we believe the most important factor has been the $120 billion in monthly federal reserve open market bond purchases and the accumulation of an $8 trillion balance sheet. The former will end, and the latter will shrink. It is not just the Fed that has aggressively purchased bonds, bidding up prices and lowering yields. Bond traders and hedge fund managers have added to positions, confident that being on the same side as the Fed was the wise place to be. Now as the Fed is about to become a seller of bonds rather than a buyer, Wall Street’s “smart money” is likely to follow suit. Against this backdrop, fixed income securities and bond substitutes such as high dividend paying utilities and absolute return hedge funds are substantially overpriced and are not likely to produce attractive returns going forward.This expectation of a reversion to the mean for interest rates helped 2021 performance, though not as much as we had hoped. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury did indeed increase from +0.92% at the beginning of the year to +1.52% at year-end. An underreported story was the poor performance of bonds last year. The Barclays Aggregate Index declined -1.67% for the year ending December compared to a return of +28.71% for equities as measured by the S&amp;P 500. Interest rates have continued to climb in 2022 with the 10-year Treasury at +1.79% as we go to print. This move higher in rates has contributed to our good, early start to 2022. Smaller positions in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) also benefited from higher rates, principally with their ability to invest customer cash.”7.

The bottom line represents a rise of 11% from the prior-year quarter.Shares of BK gained 4.9% in pre-market trading on better-than-expected earnings. The full-day trading session will display a clearer picture.Results have been aided by a rise in net interest revenues. However, asset balances witnessed a decline, which was a negative. Also, higher expenses hurt the results to some extent.Net income applicable to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $319 million or 39 cents per share, down from $881 million or $1.04 per share recorded in the year-ago quarter.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseTotal revenues grew 6% year over year to $4.28 billion. The top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.18 billion.Net interest revenues, on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, were $929 million, up 44.3% year over year. The rise reflected higher interest rates on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding expenses and lower interest-earning assets.The net interest margin (FTE basis) expanded 37 basis points (bps) year over year to 1.05%.Total fee and other revenues declined 1.2% to $3.35 billion. The decline was due to a fall in investment management and performance fees, financing-related fees, and investment and other revenues.Total non-interest expenses (GAAP basis) were $3.68 billion, up 26.1% year over year. The rise was due to an increase in almost all cost components, except for sub-custodian and clearing costs, costs related to the amortization of intangible assets, and other expenses.Asset Balances DeclineAs of Sep 30, 2022, assets under management were $1.78 trillion, down 22.9% year over year. The decline was due to lower market values and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by net inflows.Assets under custody and/or administration of $42.2 trillion declined 6.8%, primarily reflecting lower market values and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by client inflows and net new business.Story continuesCredit Quality ImprovesAllowance for loan losses, as a percentage of total loans, was 0.23%, down 13 bps from the prior-year quarter.In the reported quarter, the company recorded provision benefits of $30 million compared with $45 million in the year-ago quarter. As of Sep 30, 2022, non-performing assets were $107 million, down 1% year over year.Capital Position DeterioratesAs of Sep 30, 2022, the common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.1%, down from 11.8% as of Sep 30, 2021. Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.4%, down from 5.7% as of Sep 30, 2021.Our TakeHigher interest rates, BNY Mellon’s global footprint and a strong balance sheet position are likely to keep supporting revenue growth in the near term. However, concentration risks, arising from significant dependence on fee-based revenues, are major concerns. Recessionary fears are expected to put additional pressure on the company's asset values (which witnessed a decline in the third quarter).The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation QuoteCurrently, BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other Major BanksHigher loan balance, rising rates and solid markets performance drove JPMorgan’s JPM third-quarter 2022 earnings of $3.12 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.97. The results included $959 million or 24 cents of net investment securities losses in the Corporate segment.As expected, the performance of JPM’s investment banking business was hugely disappointing. In the quarter, operating expenses recorded a rise. Nevertheless, higher interest rates and a solid rise in loan balance aided the bank’s net interest income.U.S. Bancorp USB reported third-quarter 2022 earnings per share (excluding merger and integration-related charges) of $1.18, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1.17 per share. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.30 per share.USB’s results were primarily aided by increased net interest income, supported by higher interest rates and loan growth. However, a decline in non-interest income and higher expenses were the undermining factors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been very strong. In fact, the share price is 119% higher today. We think it's more important to dwell on the long term returns than the short term returns. Ultimately business performance will determine whether the stock price continues the positive long term trend. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 27% decline over the last twelve months.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Edwards Lifesciences managed to grow its earnings per share at 16% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 17% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on Edwards Lifesciences' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveThe total return of 27% received by Edwards Lifesciences shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -25%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 17%, each year, over five years. If the stock price has been impacted by changing sentiment, rather than deteriorating business conditions, it could spell opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance.

As Executive Vice President and the company's first Global Technology Officer, Kumar has been tasked with transforming the Walmart experience by driving innervation from the inside. And he's got 25 years of experience to pull from with prior stops at Google and Microsoft.And we are pleased to welcome in Suresh Kumar from Walmart headquarters today. Suresh, good to talk to you. You have been--SURESH KUMAR: Good to talk to you, Akiko. Thank you for having me.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, you've been in this position since 2019, so you're going on for years. You've built out a team of about 20,000 workers globally, tech-specific. Earlier this year, you announced about 5,000 people you're adding to this team with hubs in places like Atlanta as well as Toronto. Where are you along in that journey? And what does that say about how Walmart sees tech driving its next chapter?SURESH KUMAR: Yeah. I am leading a global team of wonderful technologists across the world. And we are building the next generation of retail, the experiences for our customers, and we are building the tools and technologies that are completely transforming our business.As you know, Walmart's purpose is really about saving money and helping people lead better lives. Technology is such a critical part of delivering on this promise. And that's what we are setting out to do, whether it is enabling the customer to be able to buy right in the middle of their social feed when they get inspired, or having their products delivered all the way into the refrigerator. We are building the technology that enables all of this to happen.And we are building tools and capabilities that are completely transforming our business. Retail is getting disrupted. And the role of technology really is to actually help Walmart be the retail leader in the disruption that's already starting to happen. And we can see that in customer experiences. We can see that in the way in which we use data to drive efficiencies. We can see that in the ways in which our associates are working in order to be able to serve our customers better. All of this is part of the transformation that is enabled by technology. And that's what me and the team are setting out to do.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: And we'll get into more of the specifics in just a bit. But I to pull back because you've talked a lot about the transformations that have happened in retail. And you've said, look, they happen about every 20 years. I think a lot of our viewers are familiar with the most recent one, which, I would argue, is the push to e-commerce driven by your competitor, Amazon. But you say, we are in the middle of another cycle. What does that look like?SURESH KUMAR: Yes. See, every industry goes through disruptive cycles. Typically, all of these things are actually driven by advances in technology, like you mentioned, the last big disruption in retail was really the introduction of e-commerce. That was enabled by the growth of internet.But since then, we have seen so many improvements in technology. We have got incredible computing power in the palm of our hand. We have mapped every single square-inch of the planet. We have computers through deep learning that can recognize and understand natural language. And we have computers that can recognize objects.All of these things are coming together, and they are the fuel for the next round of disruption that we are already starting to see. We are starting to see that in the way in which customers are finding, discovering, and getting inspired for new products. We are seeing disruptions in terms of how people shop. We are seeing disruption in terms of how products get delivered to the customers.Walmart is in a unique position because the true disruptors are those who are going to really be able to look at the entire whole customer experience. It's not just about online. It's not just about the stores. It's about making sure that the customer experience is a delightful experience from the time that they get inspired all the way to when the product gets delivered. It's not just only about reducing friction, it's about creating a delightful experience. And that is actually going to continue to get disrupted.Walmart, like I said, is the company that can take care of the entire or whole customer experience. And the role of technology is to be able to enable that, in a way that only Walmart will be able to deliver.AKIKO FUJITA: And so when we look at that and changing the shopping experience, number one, I mean, you've sort of taken a two-track approach, number one, developing technology in-house, but also partnering with those like Adobe. Let's talk about the in-house part of it. How are you determining where to put your investments? How much of this is about driving efficiencies to improve the experience? How much of it is about the shopping experience itself?SURESH KUMAR: Absolutely. So the way in which we look at our technology investments, largely, there are three different things that we concentrate on. First, like you said, is really about the customer experience. We want to create absolutely delightful customer experiences, no matter how they shop and when they shop and where they shop. GreatExample is what we just rolled out, which is Be Your Own Model. You know, shopping for an outfit, we want to make it as fun as possible. When you're shopping for an outfit, you don't want to rely on some models that we have chosen to see what the outfit actually looks like.So this is a technology that we have used advanced machine learning so that we know how the outfit will actually drape on your particular body. So you can be a lot more comfortable about buying that particular outfit. It reduces friction. It makes it more delightful. And it increases trust. So those are one area where we really are focused on, how to make shopping not just friction-free, but really delightful.The second area is really about enabling our 2.3 million associates to help serve our customers better, more efficiently, so that they can focus on what they need to do best. Same types of advanced technology can be used for our associates as well. One good example is what we call VizPick.This is where our associates can use AR to be able to be guided in the back room to figure out what products they need to pick and fold it in from the back room, bring it from the back room, and restock it on our store. It makes it very, very efficient for them. They don't need to print out a list. The system guides them. So they can focus a lot more on being efficient in what they do.The third area is really around transforming the business through automation by extracting insights out of the huge amount of scale and data that only Walmart has got, to not just automate, but to optimize every part of our decision making, whether it is about how we choose our assortments that are local, that are customized for the market that we serve, all the way to how we price, how we mark down, to how we optimize our supply chain in real time. All of these things are enabled by the scale, the data that we have and our ability to reason over that using machine learning, using advanced models. That really allows us to be able to reduce the cost and really go back to our purpose of saving people money.AKIKO FUJITA: And, Suresh, you just pointed on a keyword that I'm thinking about when you're talking about all these products you're rolling out, which is the collection of data. I mean, that itself is such a big commodity for so many companies. Number one, it tells you what shopper behavior is going to be like. It allows you to sell ads online against some of that. I mean, how are you thinking about the commercialization of that as you integrate technology more and more into the Walmart experience?SURESH KUMAR: Yes. So the great thing about Walmart is that we serve our customers in a-- we talk about is the whole customer experience, right? So whether it is online, whether it's inside the stores. We saw our customers the way they want, where they want, and how they want. And this basically means that we can get a lot more insights about what is the best way to be able to serve our customers. This comes from both the whole customer experience nature as well as, obviously, the scale at which we operate.What we are focused on take that data and turn it into insights that ultimately serve our customers better. When we talk about commercialization or when we talk about taking the data, ultimately, we want to do two things. We want to be able to serve our customers in a much more personalized, much more-- in a much deeper way. And we want to create an ecosystem, where, not just Walmart, but all of our partners and all of our suppliers and all of the ecosystem partners also benefit from that.That is what we are trying to build out here. So that it is it's an open system. It's not a walled garden. We want everybody to be able to participate and, ultimately, benefit the customer.AKIKO FUJITA: You are the Global CTO, I can't let you go without asking you about crypto because Walmart did make some headlines at the end of last year when you filed a number of key trademarks that appeared to point to the company's intentions to sell as well as market virtual goods. You've already got blockchain technology integrated into the system here. What's the role of crypto in Walmart's future?SURESH KUMAR: It's a great question. I think that there are three major areas of disruption, crypto falls and sort of the middle of it. I have talked before about the way in which customers are getting inspired and discovering products, that is changing. And part of that is going to happen in the metaverse. Part of that is going to happen on live streams, inside your social media app. So whether it is physical goods or virtual goods, they play a part in terms of what the customer wants.Crypto will become an important part of how customers transact. We want to make sure that we make it as friction-free for customers to be able to transact and to be able to buy and how they are able to derive value out of it, right? And that is where, I think, a lot of the disruption is going to start happening in terms of different payment methods, different payment options.The role of crypto is going to continue to play a very important role in that. And obviously, we want to be there where the customer really needs us to be. The last part of it is how products get discovered, products get delivered, a lot of disruption going on over there. But when you specifically talk about crypto, it is going to be about discovery of products, whether it is physical or virtual inside either the metaverse or upfront, and then how people transact.AKIKO FUJITA: OK. Certainly, a lot of people are going to be now looking for an announcement potentially from Walmart, at least, short, medium term. Suresh Kumar, Global CTO for Walmart, really appreciate your time today.SURESH KUMAR: Thank you.]"

MMC is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 20, before the opening bell.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MMC’s third-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $1.16, which indicates an improvement of 7.4% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus mark for revenues stands at $4.9 billion, suggesting 5.8% growth from the year-ago quarter’s tally.Earnings Surprise HistoryMarsh &amp; McLennan boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. Its bottom line beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 5.04%. This is depicted in the chart below:Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMarsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMarsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. QuoteWhat Our Quantitative Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Marsh &amp; McLennan this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is the case here.Earnings ESP: Marsh &amp; McLennan has an Earnings ESP of +0.25%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Marsh &amp; McLennan currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors to NoteMarsh &amp; McLennan’s third-quarter performance is likely to have received a boost from continued rate increases across the commercial property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurance marketplace. Quarterly results are expected to have benefited from sound performances of MMC’s Risk and Insurance Services, and Consulting segments.Solid performances of the units of Risk and Insurance Services segment, namely Marsh and Guy Carpenter might have favored the to-be-reported quarter’s performance of Marsh &amp; McLennan. Results of both sub-units are likely to have received a boost from new business generation and solid retention rates.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at the Risk and Insurance Services segment of Marsh &amp; McLennan is pegged at $2.9 billion, indicating a rise of 6.9% from the prior-year quarter’s level. The consensus mark for Marsh and Guy Carpenter revenues stands at $2.5 billion and $332 million each, suggesting respective increases of 6.4% and 5.7%, from the prior-year quarter’s corresponding reported figures.MMC’s Consulting segment is likely to have been driven by solid results of its divisions, such as Mercer and Oliver Wyman. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Consulting segment’s revenues is pegged at $2 billion, indicating 4.2% growth from the prior-year quarter’s tally.The Mercer unit is likely to have gained from solid demand for its solutions, new business growth, improved retention rates and a decent rise in defined benefits in the third quarter. Contribution from those geographies wherein MMC operates is likely to have acted as a mutual tailwind in boosting revenues of the Consulting segment’s branches. The consensus estimate for revenues of Mercer and Oliver Wyman stands at $1.4 billion and $655 million each, suggesting a rise of 3.1% and 7.4%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter’s comparable reported numbers.As one of the factors is expected to have driven the bottom line of Marsh &amp; McLennan in the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted operating income of Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting segments indicates an improvement of 7.2% and 10%, respectively, from the prior-year quarter’s corresponding reported figures.However, elevated expenses stemming from continued investments to boost capabilities and recruitment efforts coupled with inflationary pressure on loss costs are likely to have dampened the margins of Marsh &amp; McLennan in the to-be-reported quarter.Per the last earnings call, foreign exchange is expected to have an adverse impact of a penny on MMC’s margins in the third quarter. Management anticipated an interest expense of around $118 million in the to-be-reported quarter.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies worth considering from the insurance space, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Horace Mann Educators Corporation HMN has an Earnings ESP of +28.21% and a Zacks Rank #2, currently. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Horace Mann’s third-quarter 2022 earnings is pegged at 59 cents per share, indicating an improvement of 18% from the prior-year reported number.HMN’s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once.Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated RGA has an Earnings ESP of +5.32% and a Zacks Rank of 2 at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Reinsurance Group’s third-quarter 2022 earnings is pegged at $3.06 per share. A loss of $1.11 per share was reported in the prior-year quarter.RGA’s earnings beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark twice. CNO Financial Group, Inc. CNO has an Earnings ESP of +1.72% and a Zacks Rank of 3 at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CNO Financial’s third-quarter 2022 earnings stands at 49 cents per share.

48,e3ffb97c-0057-3d9b-aedc-0b0b3f129838,HBAN,2022-10-18,What's in the Offing for Huntington (HBAN) in Q3 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-offing-huntington-hban-q3-150503852.html,1666019103,STORY,"['HBAN', 'ASB-PF']","[Huntington Bancshares HBAN is slated to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 21, before the opening bell. The company’s revenues and earnings are expected to have improved year over year.In the last reported quarter, the bank recorded an earnings surprise of 5.9%. Results reflected full-quarter benefits from the TCF acquisition completed in June 2021. Strength in fee income and net interest income (“NII”) drove the top line.Huntington has a mixed earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two and lagged the same in the other two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 0.91%.Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseHuntington Bancshares Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Huntington Bancshares Incorporated QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of 38 cents has been revised downward over the past week, reflecting the bearish sentiments of analysts. Nonetheless, the figure indicates an 8.6% rise from the year-ago reported number. The consensus estimate of $1.84 billion for revenues suggests a year-over-year increase of 8.2%.Key Factors at PlayLoans: While lending activity improved sequentially in the third quarter, the pace of loan growth across most categories slowed as the quarter progressed. Per the Fed’s latest data, residential real estate loans and consumer loans slightly moderated in the third quarter from the second quarter.Commercial real estate loans, as well as commercial and industrial loan growth, accelerated in the quarter under review. This is likely to have aided Huntington’s third-quarter performance, as the majority of its loan portfolio comprises commercial loans.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $162.6 billion for average interest-earning assets in the quarter implies a marginal improvement on a sequential basis.NII: The overall lending scenario continued to improve in the third quarter. Also, the Federal Reserve raised short-term rates by 150 basis points in the quarter. The company has been dynamically managing its balance sheet to increase asset sensitivity. Hence, boosted by higher short-term rates, improvement in the lending scenario and increased average earning assets, the company’s asset yields, NIM and NII are anticipated to have been bolstered.Story continuesThe consensus estimate for NII indicates a 4.9% rise to $1.32 billion from the prior quarter’s reported figure.Non-Interest Revenues: Mortgage originations, both purchase and refinancing, continued to decline in the third quarter. Also, in the third quarter, mortgage rates increased, with the rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage crossing the 6% mark in September. The climb in mortgage rates has taken a toll on the origination market. This is expected to have affected the company’s mortgage banking net revenues.Mortgage banking fees for the to-be-reported quarter are estimated to be $38.3 million, suggesting a 13% dip on a sequential basis.In June 2022, Huntington completed the acquisition of Capstone Partners, an IB firm. The acquisition has enhanced the complementary capabilities of Huntington’s capital market business. In May 2022, the company acquired Torana to enhance its digital capabilities and enterprise payment strategy. The acquisitions are expected to have aided capital market fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for capital market fees is pegged at $81 million, indicating a 50% increase from the prior quarter’s reported figure.The consensus mark of $102 million for non-interest income indicates a 6.3% sequential rise. Trust service revenues of $64 million indicate a marginal sequential increase.The consensus mark of $522 million for non-interest income suggests a 7.6% sequential rise.Expenses: Huntington’s investments in digital capabilities, marketing and hiring personnel to aid its revenue growth are anticipated to have raised its costs. Also, the Capstone and Torana acquisitions are anticipated to have increased expenses in the quarter under review.Asset Quality: With loan growth, expectations of a worsening macroeconomic outlook and growing recession fears, HBAN is likely to have set aside more money to cover expected loan losses in the third quarter.What Our Quantitative Model RevealsHuntington has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat this time around.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Huntington is +0.72%.Zacks Rank: Huntington currently has a Zacks Rank of 3.

49,b41921a8-9161-3f4b-8116-620ddb37ed25,HBAN,2022-10-18,Enterprise Financial Services (EFSC) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q3 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enterprise-financial-services-efsc-expected-140002305.html,1666015202,STORY,"['EFSC', 'HBAN']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Enterprise Financial Services (EFSC) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis financial holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.2%.Revenues are expected to be $131.49 million, up 14.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Enterprise Financial Services?For Enterprise Financial Services, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.63%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Enterprise Financial Services will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Enterprise Financial Services would post earnings of $1.13 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.19, delivering a surprise of +5.31%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Enterprise Financial Services appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry, Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.38 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +8.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.84 billion, up 8.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Huntington Bancshares has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.72%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Huntington Bancshares will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But at least the stock is up over the last five years. In that time, it is up 24%, which isn't bad, but is below the market return of 48%. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 21% drop, in the last year.Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 10%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. View our latest analysis for Microchip Technology While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Microchip Technology managed to grow its earnings per share at 22% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 4% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Microchip Technology the TSR over the last 5 years was 33%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Microchip Technology shares lost 20% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 25%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 6% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

If you want to read about some more insurance stocks, go directly to 5 Best Insurance Stocks Under $70.The insurance sector has been one of the standout performers in a volatile marketplace in the United States over the past few months, demonstrating remarkable flexibility and resilience in overcoming a series of challenges, including the impact of the pandemic and the economic fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to a report by research firm Deloitte, this outperformance continues to be threatened by rising inflation, interest rates, loss costs, the looming threats of recession, climate change, and geopolitical upheaval. Some of the best insurance companies include Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), and MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET). Deloitte estimates that property-casualty price hikes were among the primary drivers pumping up premium volume and sending US consolidated surplus over the $1 trillion mark for the first time, even as inflation was driving loss costs even higher and faster in most markets. Per the research firm, as of May 12, average replacement costs were up 16.3% — nearly twice the Consumer Price Index rise. These numbers highlight the core contention that inflation is continuing to hamper non-life profitability even while boosting prices and top-line growth in the insurance industry. Research firm RSM claims that two key trends that investors should monitor in the space moving forward include artificial intelligence and machine learning. These, per RSM, can provide flexibility that allows insurers to innovate and transform faster. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the insurance sector and are trading at under $70 were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues10 Best Insurance Stocks Under $70austin-distel-jpHw8ndwJ_Q-unsplashBest Insurance Stocks Under $7010. Aegon N.V. (NYSE:AEG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 7   Share Price as of October 13: $3.77   Aegon N.V. (NYSE:AEG) provides insurance, pensions, and asset management services in the Americas, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. It is one of the best insurance stocks to invest in. The shares of the firm have risen recently after the company announced that it would buy back $413 million of debt and $300 million of common shares after it completed the sale of its Hungarian business for gross proceeds of EUR 620 million. On September 13, Societe Generale analyst Nick Holmes upgraded Aegon N.V. (NYSE:AEG) stock to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of EUR 5.25, noting that the company has a strong case for additional buybacks in 2023.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 7 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $16.9 million in Aegon N.V. (NYSE:AEG), compared to 7 the preceding quarter worth $34.4 million.Just like Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), and MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), Aegon N.V. (NYSE:AEG) is one of the best insurance stocks to buy now. 9. American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (NYSE:AEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14   Share Price as of October 13: $38.75     American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (NYSE:AEL) provides life insurance products in the United States. It is one of the top insurance stocks to invest in. On August 8, the company posted earnings for the second quarter of 2022, reporting earnings per share of $0.98, beating expectations by $0.27. The revenue over the period was $121.4 million. On August 11, Truist analyst Mark Hughes maintained a Buy rating on American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (NYSE:AEL) stock and raised the price target to $51 from $45, highlighting the earnings beat of the company in Q2 2022.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Pzena Investment Management is a leading shareholder in American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (NYSE:AEL), with 1.7 million shares worth more than $63.7 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, First Pacific Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (NYSE:AEL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (NYSE:AEL), a leading writer of fixed index annuities, has continued to transition to its American Equity Investment (AEL) 2.0 business model. The plan’s main goals are to diversify the company’s assets into a broader array of investments, including private debt through strategic partnerships, and to increase its use of reinsurance to free up capital. We think this is an interesting, but somewhat aggressive plan. Thus far, the results have been impressive, but we continue to monitor the credit quality of their assets as they move toward achieving their target of having 40% of their portfolio invested in private assets, up from 15.4%.”8. Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15 Share Price as of October 13: $21.23     Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) provides financial products and services in Asia, Canada, the United States, and internationally. It is one of the premier insurance stocks to invest in. On June 29, the company announced that the application to gain full control of its Chinese joint venture was accepted by Chinese regulators as the world’s second largest economy continues to open up its financial sector to allow foreign firms full ownership of their operations there. On July 27, Scotiabank analyst Meny Grauman upgraded Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) stock to Outperform from Sector Perform with an unchanged price target of C$27, noting that analysts remain constructive on the insurance sector despite falling equity markets. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 15 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $155 million in Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC), compared to 19 in the previous quarter worth $517.5 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Harding Loevner, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC), the Canadian life insurer operating primarily in North America and Asia, is a new holding. Manulife offers a full suite of life insurance products as well as retirement and wealth management services. While the wealth management and retirement products appeal to the aging populations of the Western world, long-term life insurance products address the needs of the growing number of middle-class families in places like China and southeast Asia. COVID-19-induced lockdowns in China brought the shares down to a significant discount to our estimate of long-term value. The holding now serves as a nice diversifier to our Asia-centered insurers AIA and Ping An.”7. Unum Group (NYSE:UNM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25      Share Price as of October 13: $40.66  Unum Group (NYSE:UNM) provides financial protection benefit solutions primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland.

He added that finance has gotten more involved directly and was not only prioritizing where to spend dollars, but also focusing on value creation. On September 22, Raymond James analyst Wilma Burdis initiated coverage of Unum Group (NYSE:UNM) stock with a Market Perform rating and no price target, noting that the company's valuation reflects an expectation for continued reserve strengthening within the LTC block. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 25 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $436 million in Unum Group (NYSE:UNM), compared to 30 in the previous quarter worth $323.5 million.6.

Analysts presented their findings during Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo™, which is taking place here through Thursday.""To enhance their organization’s financial position during times of economic turbulence, CIOs and IT executives must look beyond cost savings to new forms of operational excellence while continuing to accelerate digital transformation,"" said Frances Karamouzis, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner. ""The Gartner strategic technology trends for 2023 are built around three themes — optimize, scale and pioneer — where technologies can help organizations optimize resilience, operations or trust, scale vertical solutions and product delivery, and pioneer with new forms of engagement, accelerated responses or opportunity.""""However, in 2023, delivering technology will not be enough. These themes are impacted by environmental, social and governance (ESG) expectations and regulations, which translate into the shared responsibility to apply sustainable technologies. Every technology investment will need to be set off against its impact on the environment, keeping future generations in mind. ‘Sustainable by default’ as an objective requires sustainable technology,"" said David Groombridge, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner.The top strategic technology trends for 2023 are:SustainabilitySustainability traverses all of the strategic technology trends for 2023. In a recent Gartner survey, CEOs reported that environmental and social changes are now a top three priority for investors, after profit and revenue. This means that executives must invest more in innovative solutions that are designed to address ESG demand to meet sustainability goals. To do this, organizations need a new sustainable technology framework that increases the energy and material efficiency of IT services, enables enterprise sustainability through technologies like traceability, analytics, renewable energy and AI, and deploys IT solutions to help customers achieve their own sustainability goals.Story continuesPioneerMetaverseGartner defines a metaverse as a collective virtual 3D shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical and digital reality. A metaverse is persistent, providing enhanced immersive experiences. Gartner expects that a complete metaverse will be device-independent and won’t be owned by a single vendor. It will have a virtual economy of itself, enabled by digital currencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). By 2027, Gartner predicts that over 40% of large organizations worldwide will use a combination of Web3, AR cloud and digital twins in metaverse-based projects aimed at increasing revenue.SuperappsA superapp combines the features of an app, a platform and an ecosystem in one application. It not only has its own set of functionalities, but it also provides a platform for third parties to develop and publish their own mini-apps on. By 2027, Gartner predicts that more than 50% of the global population will be daily active users of multiple superapps.""Although most examples of superapps are mobile apps, the concept can also be applied to desktop client applications, such as Microsoft Teams and Slack, with the key being that a superapp can consolidate and replace multiple apps for customer or employee use,"" said Karamouzis.Adaptive AIAdaptive AI systems aim to continuously retrain models and learn within runtime and development environments based on new data to adapt quickly to changes in real-world circumstances that were not foreseen or available during initial development. They use real-time feedback to change their learning dynamically and adjust goals. This makes them suitable for operations where rapid changes in the external environment or changing enterprise goals require an optimized response.OptimizeDigital Immune SystemSeventy-six percent of teams responsible for digital products are now also responsible for revenue generation. CIOs are looking for new practices and approaches that their teams can adopt to deliver that high business value, along with mitigating risk and increasing customer satisfaction. A digital immune system provides such a roadmap.Digital immunity combines data-driven insight into operations, automated and extreme testing, automated incident resolution, software engineering within IT operations and security in the application supply chain to increase the resilience and stability of systems. Gartner predicts that by 2025, organizations that invest in building digital immunity will reduce system downtime by up to 80% - and that translates directly into higher revenue.Applied ObservabilityObservable data reflects the digitized artifacts, such as logs, traces, API calls, dwell time, downloads and file transfers, that appear when any stakeholder takes any kind of action. Applied observability feeds these observable artifacts back in a highly orchestrated and integrated approach to accelerate organizational decision-making.""Applied observability enables organizations to exploit their data artifacts for competitive advantage,"" said Karamouzis ""It is powerful because it elevates the strategic importance of the right data at the right time for rapid action based on confirmed stakeholder actions, rather than intentions. When planned strategically and executed successfully, applied observability is the most powerful source of data-driven decision-making.""AI Trust, Risk and Security ManagementMany organizations are not well prepared to manage AI risks. A Gartner survey in the U.S, U.K. and Germany found that 41% of organizations had experienced an AI privacy breach or security incident. However, that same survey found that organizations that actively managed AI risk, privacy and security achieved improved AI project results. More of their AI projects moved from proof-of-concept status into production and achieved more business value than did AI projects in organizations that did not actively manage these functions.Organizations must implement new capabilities to ensure model reliability, trustworthiness, security and data protection. AI trust, risk and security management (TRiSM) requires participants from different business units to work together to implement new measures.ScaleIndustry Cloud PlatformsIndustry cloud platforms offer a combination of SaaS, platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) providing industry-specific sets of modular capabilities to support specific industry business use cases. Enterprises can use the packaged capabilities of industry cloud platforms as building blocks to compose unique and differentiating digital business initiatives, providing agility, innovation and reduced time to market, while avoiding lock-in.By 2027, Gartner predicts that more than 50% of enterprises will use industry cloud platforms to accelerate their business initiatives.Platform EngineeringPlatform engineering is the discipline of building and operating self-service internal developer platforms for software delivery and life cycle management. The goal of platform engineering is to optimize the developer experience and accelerate product teams’ delivery of customer value.Gartner predicts that 80% of software engineering organizations will establish platform teams by 2026 and that 75% of those will include developer self-service portals.Wireless Value RealizationWhile no single technology will dominate, enterprises will use a spectrum of wireless solutions to cater for all environments, from Wi-Fi in the office, through services for mobile devices, to low-power services and even radio connectivity. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 60% of enterprises will be using five or more wireless technologies simultaneously.As networks move beyond pure connectivity, they will provide insight using built-in analysis and low-power systems will harvest energy directly from the network. This means the network will become a source of direct business value.This year's top strategic technology trends highlight those trends that will drive significant disruption and opportunity over the next five to 10 years.

This is what Gartner calls IT for sustainable growth.During the opening keynote of Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo™, which is taking place here through Thursday, Gartner analysts said that CIOs can use IT for sustainable growth by focusing on three strategies – revolutionary work, responsible investment and resilient cybersecurity.CIOs and IT executives should revolutionize work by tech-enabling the workforce to create sustainable performance. Organizations should responsibly invest to deliver both financial and sustainability outcomes. Stakeholders are demanding products that, at a minimum, do no harm, and grant competitive advantage to enterprises that can prove that they deliver responsibly and sustainably. Lastly, implement resilient cybersecurity to deliver sustainable protection that supports business outcomes without constraining them.Revolutionize Work""IT now matters more than ever in the recruitment, retention, employee engagement and high performance of all enterprise employees, not just IT. However, a new Gartner survey found that only 31% of employees said that they have the technology they need,"" said Tina Nunno, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner. ""This provides a tremendous opportunity for CIOs to make the difference. Employers who revolutionize the work and empower their workers with technology will become the employers of choice.""Gartner identified three force multipliers that CIOs should focus on to help make their organization an employer of choice and to create sustainable performance for the enterprise:Story continuesTake the friction out of work: Friction is when work is unnecessarily hard. The more friction points an organization has, the worse employee performance and retention is. By removing friction and investing in digital skills, organizations can create a more engaged workforce that is better equipped to sustain future performance.Invest aggressively in AI augmentation: To create sustainable performance, organizations should focus on impact instead of productivity. Employees need tools and technologies that empower them and increase the impact of their work. AI can increase the impact of employees by extending their reach, range and capabilities. The workforce of the future is AI-enabled.Experiment with the highly visible and highly hyped: Organizations that innovate during tough economic times stay ahead of the pack. Technology is the new epicenter of corporate culture, and one area for innovation is in digital spaces and experiences. For example, an intraverse is a virtual office that incorporates emerging metaverse technologies to bring employees together in immersive meetings to collaborate, connect and innovate. Gartner predicts that immersive meeting technologies will not plateau on the Gartner Hype Cycle for 5-10 years. Organizations that experiment with technologies early on the Hype Cycle curve will attract talent who want to stay ahead of the pack.Responsible Investment""Responsible investment is a ""two for one"" strategy for achieving sustainable growth and returns. It delivers both financial and sustainability outcomes. By sustainability, we mean environmental, social and governance,"" said Kristin Moyer, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner. ""Responsible investment matters for the people that are important to your enterprise. Employees get the opportunity to make a difference. Customers get solutions that align with their values. And investors get a more attractive investment.""Gartner identified three force multipliers that will create both a financial and sustainability return:Intelligent connected infrastructure (ICI): ICI is like an air traffic control system for ports, bridges, roads and airports. ICI combines mesh fabric, AI, IoT, cloud, analytics and edge computing to share data. Infrastructure used to be silent, but ICI gives it a voice. Investing in ICI is a force multiplier because it can increase growth for cities and businesses and improve lives for citizens.Leverage autonomous sourcing: Autonomous sourcing uses AI, machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to give organizations access to a much wider range of suppliers. Autonomous sourcing is a force multiplier because it can increase efficiency and improve supplier sustainability at the same time.Digitally reduce energy usage: CIOs should use cloud, data and analytics to establish what is called ""base load."" Base load is information on how much energy the enterprise has consumed. Implement an energy and optimization system (EMOS) to reduce energy usage by making proactive, data-led decisions in near real-time. EMOS can reduce energy usage from 4% to 15%. Use a microgrid combined with AI and ML to reduce energy costs and make money by selling energy back into the grid.Resilient Cybersecurity""A 2022 Gartner survey of board directors found that 88% of boards now view security as a business risk, not a technical one. This means that organizations need to start treating resilient, sustainable cybersecurity as a business risk that needs new types of investment,"" said Paul Proctor, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner. ""Protecting your brand makes you an employer of choice and a supplier of choice to your customers. Protecting your execution supports sustainable growth.""Gartner identified three force multipliers to deliver competitive advantage for organizations in the long term:Manage the attack surface: Use external attack surface management (EASM), a process governance and management technology, to discover vulnerable external-facing assets. Implement software composition analysis to gain visibility into software supply chain vulnerabilities. Use threat intelligence to prioritize and fix vulnerabilities.Protect business outcomes and customers: Organizations should prioritize their most important business outcomes by identifying their technology dependencies that have a direct line-of-sight to their most important business or mission outcomes. By using this business outcome approach, organizations can prioritize systems that support sustainable growth, such as manufacturing, sales and citizen engagement.Use outcome-driven metrics (ODMs) and protection-level agreements (PLAs): PLAs enable organizations to make business decisions over how much security they want and how much they want to spend. Gartner is benchmarking 16 ODMs which organizations can use to compare their protection levels to their peers. This creates an outcome-based priorities and investments roadmap. Organizations should invest in achieving protection-level outcomes, not the implementation of tools.Learn more about IT for Sustainable growth in Insights from the 2022 Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo Keynote.About Gartner IT Symposium/XpoGartner IT Symposium/Xpo™ 2022 is the world's most important gathering for CIOs and other IT executives.

His administration has considered a ban on exports of US gas, and Biden himself has called on gas station operators to immediately cut prices.Gas prices spiked above $5 a gallon in June as western sanctions against Russia squeezed crude oil supplies. They dropped to $3.87 a gallon Tuesday, according to data from the AAA.The price of gas has been lower in recent days, after starting to rise for the first time in 99 days last month. That reversal of a steady decline came after the Biden administration began releasing the record amount of crude oil from the SPR.The OPEC+ decision to slash production quotas has prompted speculation about whether the White House would respond with more drawdowns to replace some of the missing supply.

A new proposal from the 27-nation bloc’s executive arm, the European Commission, is due to be discussed this week.The plan involves a temporary mechanism that would impose a dynamic price cap for transactions on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF), a virtual marketplace in the Netherlands used for trading. The TTF’s main index is the benchmark for all gas traded on the continent.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eat“This will help avoid extreme volatility and price hikes, as well as speculation which could lead to difficulties in the supply of natural gas to some member states,” the commission said in a draft document seen by Bloomberg News.The EU member states still need to approve this “last resort” measure, and it would last for no longer than three months, according to Reuters. Around 15 countries seem to be on board with an Europe-wide limit on wholesale prices but some, like Germany, Austria, and Norway, worry that capping prices could hurt energy security as winter approaches.Why does the EU need to control prices?Before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, Moscow used to contribute to 40% of the gas in EU. But since then, Russia’s tap has reduced to a trickle.Many European buyers rejected the ruble-based payment system Putin put in place in April as a breach of contract. Over the next few months, Russia cut off the majority of gas supplies to the EU indefinitely, retaliating to sanctions against the Kremlin.The share of gas from Moscow now hovers around 7%.Moreover, OPEC seems to be in stride with Russia in its decision-making. It’s reducing output, which could send prices higher.Charted: The Russia-Ukraine war’s impact on Europe’s gasdatawrapper-chart-RIZBSWhat else does the EU’s draft proposal suggest?📝 Temporary intra-day price-spike caps on TTF.

Arriving at a consensus is only the first problem. Establishing the appropriate caps and corridors without artificially suppressing prices or affecting demand and supply remain a challenge.To avoid paying more money for less Russian gas, the EU has inked deals to get LNG or pipeline gas from the US 🇺🇸, Algeria 🇩🇿, Azerbaijan 🇦🇿, and others. Norway 🇳🇴 is already delivering more gas to the EU than Russia. It’s also trying to move towards LNG and interconnectors to reduce reliance on Russian oil.In the long-term, renewable sources like hydrogen and biomethane are coming into focus. A month ago, the European Parliament approved the proposal to increase the target in the Renewable Energy Directive from 40% to 45% by 2030. The Commission earlier proposed reducing energy consumption in 2030 by 9% compared to 2020—now it’s pushing to up the target to 13%.Related stories]"

White House chief of staff Ron Klain said on Twitter on Tuesday that Biden would address gasoline prices on Wednesday, but did not provide details.The White House and Department of Energy did not respond to requests for comment.Biden has in the past lambasted the oil industry for high energy prices, saying they are reaping bumper profits at a time when Americans are struggling with inflation. His administration has also said it is studying more drastic options to lower consumer prices, such as limiting fuel exports, something sources said he is likely to repeat in his Wednesday speech.Rising retail gasoline prices have helped boost inflation to the highest in decades, posing a risk to Biden and his fellow Democrats ahead of the Nov. 8 midterm elections, in which they are seeking to keep control of Congress.The administration's plan for the SPR would likely include marketing the remaining 14 million barrels from the administration's previously announced record sale from the reserve of 180 million barrels that started in May.The Energy Department still has about 14 million barrels of SPR oil left to sell from that release because selling was slowed in July and August by holidays and hot weather.The administration has also spoken with oil companies about selling an additional 26 million barrels from a congressionally mandated sale in fiscal year 2023, a fourth source said. Fiscal year 2023 began Oct. 1.Story continues""The administration has a small window ahead of midterms to try to lower fuel prices, or at least demonstrate that they are trying,"" said a source familiar with the White House deliberations. ""The White House did not like $4 a gallon gas and it has signaled that it will take action to prevent that again.""Average U.S. gasoline prices hit about $3.89 a gallon on Monday, up about 20 cents from a month ago and 56 cents higher than last year at this time, according to the AAA motor group. Gasoline prices hit a record average above $5.00 in June.David Turk, Biden's deputy energy secretary, said last week the administration can tap the SPR in coming weeks and months as necessary to stabilize oil.The administration has also spoken with energy companies about buying back oil through 2025 to replenish the SPR, the sources said, in a sign it wants to ensure drillers keep pumping.In May, the DOE said it would launch bids late this year for a buy-back of about one third of the 180 million barrel sale. It suggested then that deliveries would be linked to lower oil prices and lower demand, likely after fiscal year 2023, which ends Sept. 30 next year. Two sources said the buy-backs could continue through 2025.Biden officials in recent months also urged oil refiners including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Valero to not increase exports of fuel and warned them it could take action if plants do not build inventories.The administration has not taken a potential ban of gasoline and diesel exports off the table although opponents of such a move say it could exacerbate Europe's energy crisis and raise fuel prices at home.(Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw, Timothy Gardner, Laura Sanicola and Andrea Shalal; Editing by Sam Holmes and Marguerita Choy)]"

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 63% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$8.0b. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 24% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Morgan Stanley, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Morgan Stanley, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Morgan Stanley?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Morgan Stanley. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Morgan Stanley, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Morgan Stanley is not owned by hedge funds. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 22% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.9% by the third-largest shareholder.We did some more digging and found that 8 of the top shareholders account for roughly 51% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Morgan StanleyThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Morgan Stanley in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$323m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Morgan Stanley. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 22% of Morgan Stanley. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth.

This week’s list includes JPMorgan JPM, Citigroup C, Wells Fargo WFC and Morgan Stanley MS.Can Bank Stocks Maintain the Recent Momentum?The market liked what it saw in the quarterly releases from JPMorgan, Citigroup and even Wells Fargo on an otherwise down day for the indexes. There was plenty to like in these results, with higher interest rates helping these big players expand their margins as demand for loans remained strong overall, despite slowing mortgage and auto originations.The Citigroup report was relatively ‘noisy’ and less impressive on traditional profitability metrics, but the market liked the progress made on management’s restructuring plan that has been in the works for some time now.The fact that the investment banking business was weak in Q3 was no surprise for the market. We knew that advisory fees will likely be about half of what they were in the year-earlier period, as persistent macroeconomic headwinds have been weighing on deal making.For JPMorgan, investment banking fees were down -47%, while the same segment at Morgan Stanley dropped a larger -55% from the year-earlier level. Citigroup suffered an even bigger decline in investment banking revenues, down -64% YoY.Morgan Stanley still remains an investment banking powerhouse, but it has deliberately been reducing its trading footprint, investing more in the relatively stable investment management business. Revenue in that business increased +3% from the year-earlier level and accounted for 47% of the total in Q3.Trading revenues rose +8% at JPMorgan, with fixed income up +22% and stocks down -11% from the same period last year. Trading revenues were up only +3% at Morgan Stanley. Unlike JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, trading revenues were down -7% at Citigroup, with the +1% gain in fixed income trading insufficient to offset the -25% decline in equities.Story continuesThe strength for these banking giants lay in traditional commercial banking, with expanded net interest margins and bigger loan portfolios resulting in very strong net interest earnings. JPMorgan’s loan portfolio was up +7% from the same period last year, even though demand for rate-sensitive auto and mortgage loans were significantly down. The same unit for Wells Fargo climbed an impressive +10% YoY.JPMorgan’s net interest margin of 2.08% in the September quarter compared to 1.8% in the preceding period. Net interest margins were up at Citigroup as well, with the sequential comparison at 2.31% vs. 2.24%. At Wells Fargo, net interest margin in Q3 came in at 2.83%, up from 2.39% in the preceding period.The big year-over-year decline in profitability for each of these companies is primarily a function of differences in how reserves or provision for loan losses behaved in the two periods. Tough comparisons in the investment banking businesses are the other contributing factor. At JPMorgan, Q3 earnings declined -16.7% from the same period last year on +10.4% higher revenues. Quarterly earnings were down -39.4% at Citigroup and up +2.5% at Wells Fargo. For Morgan Stanley, Q3 and revenues were down -28.4% and -12% from the year-earlier level, respectively.In terms of the Finance sector scorecard, we now have results from 22.6% of the sector’s total market cap in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total earnings for these companies are down -16.2% from the same period last year on +4.3% higher revenues, with 88.9% beating EPS estimates and 55.6% beating revenue estimates.Looking at the Finance sector as a whole, total Q3 earnings for the sector are expected to be down -8.5% on +3.2% higher revenues.For the Zacks Major Banks industry, which includes Citi and JPMorgan and accounts for roughly 40% of total Finance sector earnings, total Q3 earnings are on track to be down -14.3% from the same period last year on +5.8% higher revenues.The earnings declines expected in Q4 are essentially a replay of the forces that are shaping the Q3 numbers.The much bigger question of the long-term profitability outlook for the banking industry is a function of the negative impact that the coming economic downturn will have on the group’s credit quality.Skeptics of the banking industry argue that the group ends up giving away all the profits that it accumulated during the good times when the macro environment turns south. The Covid downturn was an anomaly in that respect, but there is some truth to the allegation.We will see how the economic picture unfolds in the coming quarters, but the credit quality metrics in the reported Q3 results do not point toward any imminent deterioration.Q3 Earnings Season ScorecardIncluding results from the aforementioned big banks on Friday, we now have Q3 results from 35 S&amp;P 500 members. We get into the heart of the reporting cycle this week, with results from more than 150 companies on deck, including results from 63 S&amp;P 500 members.This week’s line-up of reports is concentrated in the Finance sector, but we will get results from a host of bellwether operators in other spaces.For the 35 index members that have reported results already, total earnings are down -5.6% from the same period last year on +9.5% higher revenues, with 74.4% beating EPS estimates and 54.3% beating revenue estimates.As you can see here, companies are finding it hard to beat consensus estimates, even though estimates had significantly come down ahead of the start of this earnings season.The Earnings Big Picture2022 Q3 earnings are expected to be up +0.2% on +9% higher revenues.Don’t forget that it is the strong contribution from the Energy sector that is keeping the aggregate Q3 earnings growth in positive territory. Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the S&amp;P 500 index would be down -6.6% from the same period last year.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Breaking Down the Rough Start to Q3 Earnings Season  Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

(NYSE: FE) reminds the public to keep safety top of mind as they decorate their homes and partake in seasonal festivities. Celebrating responsibly will help keep people of all ages safe and the electricity flowing reliably this season.FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)""Halloween is a peak time of year for spooky celebrations and activities, but it also has the potential to present some truly scary electrical hazards if simple precautions aren't taken,"" said Candace Webb, manager of public safety at FirstEnergy. ""As children and adults celebrate the holiday, we want them to know where potential electrical or fire risks exist so they can take the steps needed to minimize them.""Keep Your Home Spooky and SafeIf your home will be decked out with eerie lights and jack-o'-lanterns, take the time to ensure all decorations are installed safely and functioning properly. Consider these safety measures while decorating this Halloween: Never put any decorations on or near utility equipment, like poles and transformers.Inspect each electrical cord of lights and decorations before use. Look for damage such as cracked, frayed or bare wires, damaged sockets or loose connections that can lead to shocks. If a cord is hot, don't use it.Use the proper clips for securing lights and decorations. Staples and nails can damage electrical cords.Decorative lights should be approved by Underwriter's Laboratory and carry a UL seal on the tag. Red UL marks indicate the lights are approved for indoor or outdoor use, while green UL tags indicate approval for indoor use only.Outdoor lights and decorations should be plugged into outlets that feature Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs).Indoor lights should not touch window treatments, carpet or furniture.Replace traditional candles with flame-free options like flashlights, battery-operated candles or glow sticks to light up your jack-o'-lanterns or seasonal decor.Keep flammable decorations, like cornstalks and bales of hay, far away from any open flames or heat sources, such as candles, heaters and light bulbs.Story continuesStay Safe While Trick-or-TreatingWhile collecting treats this season, the following tips can help keep your family and friends safe during popular events, including trunk-or-treat or trick-or-treat:Keep a clear, well-lit path at your home for trick-or-treaters. Prevent falls by keeping walkways, steps and porches free of electrical cords or any other items that may pose a hazard for trick-or-treaters.Carry a flashlight or add reflective tape, LED shoelaces or glow sticks to your costume to make yourself more visible to others in dark or dimly lit areas.Limit travel to well-lit, familiar areas. Always walk in groups and use sidewalks or crosswalks whenever possible.Motorists should use extra caution and keep an eye out for children crossing the street. Know the trick-or-treat hours in your neighborhood and anticipate heavy foot traffic.Customers are reminded to report any issues with their streetlights so they can be addressed as quickly as possible. Here are the best ways to report a streetlight outage:Call FirstEnergy at 1-888-LIGHTSS (1-888-544-4877) and say ""streetlight"" after the greetingReport the lighting problem onlineWhen reporting a streetlight outage, please provide the following information:Visit www.firstenergycorp.com/publicsafety to learn about FirstEnergy's ""Stop.

The bottom line beat estimates by 8.9%, on average, over the trailing four quarters.Key Points to NoteWhirlpool has been reeling under global supply-chain disruptions and weak demand. Supply-chain disruptions have led to higher freight costs. These factors are likely to have marred the company’s margin performance in the to-be-reported quarter.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management predicted the inefficiencies across the supply chain, particularly in distribution and labor, to continue. It also anticipated the global cost inflation in steel and resins to remain a headwind. Inflationary pressures are likely to have significantly impacted the third-quarter 2022 performance.However, the company has been undertaking cost-based pricing efforts to help offset raw material inflation. It has also been on track with early and decisive actions to protect margins and productivity amid the ongoing supply-chain constraints and significant inflationary pressures.Whirlpool Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Whirlpool Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseWhirlpool Corporation price-eps-surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Whirlpool this time around.

78,246b5f3d-7bb5-31a4-bb28-3417e1ac3f7a,NWS,2022-10-18,Fox (FOXA) and News Corp to Merge Under One Media Empire,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-foxa-news-corp-merge-164904832.html,1666025344.0,STORY,"['FOXA', 'NWSA']","[Fox Corporation’s FOXA founder Rupert Murdoch recently announced that the company is considering a merger with the media publishing company, News Corporation NWSA.Special board committees have been established by both companies and are at an initial stage of discussion to evaluate a possible deal and potential financial terms.A merger of the two companies would likely be structured as a stock deal. The exchange ratio reflecting the relative value of each company would be negotiated by the board committees of independent directors.What Does This Merger Bring to Fox?This merger of Fox Corporation and News Corporation would bring back high-profile business divisions under one roof after a split in 2013. Fox’s Fox News, Fox broadcast network, local TV stations and the Tubi streaming service would be combined with News Corp’s Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, as well as other assets including HarperCollins Publishers and news organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia.This would diversify and broaden the portfolio of Fox Corporation hence gaining traction with more customers and adding new sources of revenue to its top line.Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteThe publishing wing of Murdoch’s empire, News Corp has been performing better than expected. The Journal, part of its Dow Jones unit, enjoyed robust growth in its digital-subscription business over the past few years. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Digital-only subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products rose 9% year over year.The digital real-estate unit and book-publishing business also have propelled growth. Revenues in the Digital Real Estate Services segment increased 7% year over year to $443 million in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022.Fox’s driving engine has been Fox News with Fox News Channel once again closing August as the best-performing news brand for 18 consecutive months. Fox News usually attracts more prime-time audiences than its rivals and is competitive with the more widely distributed broadcast networks as well.Murdoch sees potential moneymaking and cost-saving opportunities in joining the two companies. The new company could look for ways to integrate its media properties. It could also explore ways to use the company’s assets for emerging business lines, such as sports betting, for which Fox has already laid a foundation by launching a sports-betting platform called Fox Bet along with the Stars Group in 2019.The merged companies could potentially save money by hiring one management team and maintaining one set of relationships with vendors, the people said.Story continuesThreats Attached to Proposed MergerHowever, this merger also brings some headwinds for Fox. Readers’ preference for accessing news online, mostly free, has made News Corporation’s print-advertising model increasingly redundant.Digital platforms, such as Meta Platform’s META Facebook, Twitter TWTR, Google and Amazon, which have higher mass penetration, audience data and targeting capabilities, may impact News Corporation’s share of the digital display advertising market.Meta benefits from increasing mobile ad revenues and growing adoption of stories by advertisers across Instagram. Twitter’s initiatives to add features and focus on effectively tackling abuse issues are helping it to expand the monetized user base, thereby driving ad revenues.A major portion of News Corporation’s total revenues is generated outside the United States. The ongoing foreign exchange fluctuation or the U.S. dollar gaining strength may hurt both the top and bottom lines of the company.Fox’s cable TV business also faces a serious threat from OTT platforms due to cord-cutting and changing consumer preferences. This does not bode well for Fox.In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Cable Network Programming EBITDA decreased 6.8% year over year to $628 million. The EBITDA margin contracted 520 bps to 43%.Fox, which currently has Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) declined 14.5% year to date against the Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector, which was down 41.7%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Nano-Cap Stocks To Buy For 2022.Nano-cap stocks refer to companies that have a market cap of less than or around $50 million. These are volatile investments or trades and investors should always evaluate their risk tolerance before thinking about parking some cash in nano-caps.A study conducted by O’Shaughnessy Asset Management, a Connecticut-based money management firm, examined and compared the returns of small-caps and large-caps between 1964 and 2017. The researchers at OSAM found that small-cap stocks returned over 5.1% per year between 1964 and 2017 and outperformed large-cap stocks, which returned -11.0% per year over the same period.Nancy Prial, co-CEO of Massachusetts-based Essex Investment Management, appeared in an interview on CNBC where she made her bull case for small-cap stocks. Here are some comments from Nancy Prial:""We saw small-caps and interestingly even micro-caps outperform on a relative basis (in the third quarter of 2022), and small-cap growth and micro-cap growth were two of the only sectors that were actually up a little bit for the quarter. One of the other factors for small-caps here is not only are the stocks very attractively valued, selling at valuations of 10x or less, in aggregate, on next year's earnings and those earnings might be too high but that's still a great valuation. We have also seen, historically, that it's not really rising inflation so much as it is inflation that is high, leveling out, and starting to come down, which is the scenario that we think we are entering today. So that bodes very well for the outlook of this very neglected sector of the market (small-caps and micro-caps)...We are going to go into a market that rewards individual stocks, as opposed to macro themes, that will be even more tailwinds for the small-cap sector""Story continuesNano-cap stocks are not ideal for risk-averse investors. For investors with low risk tolerance, the best bet is to stick with investing in stable and mature businesses such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe screened for nano-cap stocks and identified stocks that had attractive valuations, strong fundamentals, and interesting growth catalysts.

Factors That Augur WellABM Industries started a comprehensive transformational initiative called 2020 Vision in 2015. This initiative aimed to attain long-term profitable growth through an industry-based go-to-market approach. As part of this initiative, ABM centralized the key functional areas, reinforced its sales capabilities and began investing in service delivery tools and processes to support standard operating practices important for its long-term success. These, in turn, enhanced ABM’s Janitorial, Parking, Facilities Services, Building &amp; Energy Solutions, and Airline Services offerings to strengthen its position as a leading integrated facilities management company.We are also impressed with ABM Industries’ endeavors in rewarding its shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. In fiscal 2021, ABM paid out $51 million of dividends but did not repurchase any shares. In fiscal 2020, ABM returned $49.3 million through dividend payments and $5.1 million through share buybacks.In fiscal 2019, ABM Industries returned $47.7 million of dividend payments to its shareholders but did not repurchase any shares.  Such moves indicate ABM’s commitment to creating its shareholder value and underline its confidence in its business. These initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence in the stock but also positively impact the earnings per share.Some RisksABM Industries' current ratio at the end of the July quarter was pegged at 1.21, lower than the current ratio of 1.45 reported at the end of the prior-year quarter. A decreasing current ratio is not desirable as it suggests a company’s inefficiency in serving its short-term debt obligations.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderABM Industries currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

If the referendum receives roughly 623,000 signatures by the first week of December, the measure will appear on the November 2024 California ballot.The legislation could pave the way for raising the minimum wage for fast food workers to $22 an hour for employers with more than 26 workers. Currently, the minimum wage stands at $15 in the state.""Equitable? You signed a bill from the hills of Napa that singles out franchise owners with new rules and costs to appease your biggest campaign donors; will raise prices on lower income Californians and will accelerate business leaving the state,"" tweeted the CEO of the International Franchise Association Matt Haller to Newsom.Niccol predicts any changes to the industry that come as a result of the Fast Food Council will ultimately backfire on Newsom.""The brand is loved in California and the employees love working there, and the customers love getting our food.

If you want to see some more undervalued stocks to buy,  go directly to 5 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.Undervalued stocks are defined as stocks that arguably trade for below what they are worth in terms of their fair value. Given each stock is different, there is no real metric to define which stocks are undervalued and which aren't. Forward Price to earnings ratios are not perfect as analyst estimates could be wrong and market valuations can change over time. Analyst price targets are also just a reflection of what analysts think and not what will actually happen.Nevertheless, the two metrics are still useful as information, and generally undervalued stocks are stocks of high quality companies that trade substantially below their historical valuations. Given that markets can be bearish at times, high quality stocks can be undervalued and their stock prices can go even lower for a long time.Due to the Federal Reserve having increased interest rates 5 times this year, the markets have fallen substantially in 2022. The S&amp;P 500 is down around 25% and the NASDAQ is down around 35%.As a result, the stocks of many high quality companies with quality earnings potential and strong competitive advantages have fallen substantially year to date.If the economy recovers in the long run, the stocks of those high quality companies could recover and rise too.When that happens, however, is uncertain and it looks like 2023 could be a year with potentially more rate hikes and an economic recession as well.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to hold a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors. If economic data fails to meet estimates or sentiment worsens, the market could decline further. In the long term, however, the earnings per share of the high quality companies will likely continue to grow and their stock prices could be higher if the market becomes more bullish.Story continues7 Stocks to Buy According to Eduardo Costa's Calixto Global InvestorsSource: pexelsMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now, we selected stocks that we think have the right mix of value, competitive advantages and scale. Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we then ranked them based on the number of hedge funds that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q2 2022.12 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now12. Kimberly Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Kimberly Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) is a leading consumer products company that has a forward P/E ratio of 17.86 and also a dividend yield of 4.1% as of October 16. Although the world faces headwinds and there could be a recession in 2023, Kimberly Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB)'s earnings per share is likely steadier than many other companies and Kimberly Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB)'s stock could potentially bounce back from its down 20.79% year to date performance in 2022 once things normalize in the longer term.Of the 895 hedge funds in our database, 24 owned shares of Kimberly Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) at the end of the second quarter.Alongside Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Kimberly Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) is an undervalued stock that's held by many hedge funds in our database at the end of Q2 2022.11. The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) is a leading household and personal products company with a forward P/E of almost 25. While that's still premium priced, The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) has a dividend yield of 3.6% as of 10/16.Although some analysts aren't as bullish on the company given the average analyst target price of $130.07 versus the current stock price of $131.29, The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) has high quality earnings and its earnings potential could bounce back to pre-Covid levels in the long term. In the near term, the company could have downside if sentiment weakens or the economy worsens.With 31 hedge fund holders we track owning shares of The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) at the end of Q2 2022, the company ranks #11 on our list of 12 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.10. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55While Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has a P/E ratio of 24.29 and a forward P/E ratio of 25.74, the company has a durable income stream and is arguably undervalued. Analysts have an average target price of $96.71 per share on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Matrix Asset Advisors commented on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a premiere global coffee brand supported by over 32,600 stores across the world. The firm has a long history of beverage innovation and strong employee/barista relations with the firm paying above-market wages and benefits. Starbucks has a strong balance sheet and finances. The company generates steady and consistent cash flow, selling millions of cups of premium coffee every day. The company’s share price declined in part due to its large business in China which was largely shut down due to Covid restrictions and because of rising commodity and labor costs. We think the shares are attractively priced for a company that should grow 10% plus per year with a dividend yield of 2.6% at our average cost.9. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is down 23.5% year to date given the S&amp;P 500's decline of around 25% year to date. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)'s dividend yield of 2.92% as of October 16 also isn't as attractive given the Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. Nevertheless, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has high quality earnings that are likely pretty durable. In the long term, the stock could bounce back if the economy rebounds. Analysts have an average price target of $149.21 per share.8. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares have fallen substantially year to date with the stock down almost 50% in 2022. According to NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)'s first quarter earnings report, inventories are building and the company's gross margins are weaker. If there is a recession in 2023, the company could find it harder to maintain its growth. In the long term, however, demand for NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)'s products will likely return to normal and the company's stock price could potentially be higher. Analysts have an average price target of $113.04 per share.7. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a high quality conglomerate that is selling for just 15.6 times forward earnings estimates. Although the Federal Reserve rate hikes have made the Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s dividend yield of around 2.75% as of October 16 less attractive, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) still has long term upside. Demand for healthcare products will only grow as the world develops.83 hedge funds in our database owned shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) at the end of the second quarter, ranking it #7 on our list of 12 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.6. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 104JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a bank that has benefited from higher net interest income due to the rising interest rates. Nevertheless, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) also faces potential headwinds if the economy slows due to the rapid rise in those rates and its stock could fall further in the near term.In the long term, however, the bank has a lot of qualities that might make it undervalued.  Vltava Fund said the following about JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term. JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008. A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.In addition to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are undervalued stocks held by many hedge funds at the end of Q2 2022.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.Suggested articles:15 Most Valuable British CompaniesMost Valuable Companies in HistoryTop 10 High Dividend Stocks To Buy NowDisclosure: None. 12 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
106,8cd9a687-fab1-3fa6-9d0c-3ae1c37191b5,SYY,2022-10-18,7 Consumer Staples Stocks to Buy in a Falling Market,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-consumer-staples-stocks-buy-210327288.html,1665781407,STORY,"['KO', 'KR', 'SYY', 'COST', 'KMB', 'PG']","[Consumer staples are items considered essential for everyday life. This category typically includes clothing, food, and personal care items that everyone purchases on a regular basis. Accordingly, consumer staples stocks are simply shares of companies that produce and sell those items. Consumer staples stocks tend to perform well in difficult times, and have become synonymous with defensive stocks. In short, this group generally performs better than the market in a selloff. That’s held true in 2022. The Consumer Staples Select Sector ETF (NYSEARCA:XLP) has lost about 13% of its value this year. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has declined more than 23% during the same period. Accordingly, it makes sense to pivot to consumer staples stocks in a falling market in order to mitigate losses. Here are the best consumer staples stocks to consider right now. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPGProcter &amp; Gamble$125.08KMBKimberly-Clark$113.21COSTCostco$454.65KRKroger$43.16KOCoca-Cola$54.98SYYSysco$73.74BGBunge$84.99Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)A Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) distribution center in Vandalia.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comProcter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) tops my list of best consumer staples stocks to buy for a reason. This company sells a wide range of household products with well-known brands including Tide, Bounty, Charmin, Gillette, and many more. The company’s strategy is to produce superior products with superior packaging and brand communications, dominate the retail landscape, and provide value to consumers. Purchasing PG stock makes sense because of the steady nature of its earnings. Procter &amp; Gamble tends to be within a few cents of EPS consensus numbers quarter in and quarter out. Last quarter it missed by a penny, the quarter before that, it beat EPS expectations by 4 cents. This consistently is what long-term investors looking for defensiveness will like to see. During the April through June quarter, P&amp;G saw organic volume decrease by 1%. However, organic sales increased by 7%. That’s a testament to the strength of the firm’s brands. Consumers are willing to pay more because of the brand equity P&amp;G provides, and trust that the company is providing high-quality every-day items.   Story continuesPG stock has yielded annual returns of 9.43% over the past decade. That’s more than double the return of the New York Stock Exchange, where it is listed. In other words, it’s a strong historical performer that will likely continue to outperform the market.  Kimberly-Clark (KMB)Kimberly Clark (KMB) sign, positioned outside the world headquarters’ main entrance.Source: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.comKimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) stock provides many of the paper and cotton products brands that are ubiquitous in homes, businesses, and schools around the world. As the company notes on its website, its brands are sold in 175 countries and used by one-quarter of the world’s population daily. KMB stock has had a tough 2022, declining more than 21% in value. However, there are positives to be taken from what has happened. Kimberly-Clark has dealt with input cost increases that have nearly doubled this year. That should lead to declining EPS figures as rising costs normally cut into earnings. That said, Kimberly-Clark notes that it now expects organic sales growth to be between 5% to 7% in 2022. That is an increase over the 3% to 4% growth guidance the company provided at the beginning of the year. Consequently, EPS expectations for 2022 have held steady with between 3% to 9% growth expected. That’s great news for investors. And that’s why, despite the stock losing value, it could be an excellent time to buy. Costco (COST)Costco logo on a sign on a Costco store.Source: ARTYOORAN / Shutterstock.comInvestors have grown accustomed to expecting perfection from Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock. That’s the gist of the message from Citi (NYSE:C) analyst Paul Lejuez. Costco’s sales in the most recent quarter were in-line with Wall Street expectations, reaching $70.8 billion. And the company’s earnings per share (EPS), at $4.20, bested consensus figures by 3 cents. While those results were impressive, Costco’s margins were something of a problem. The company’s gross margin declined 70 basis points year-over-year, signaling some concern among investors. The problem is that COST stock is an investor favorite and carries rich valuation metrics including a P/E ratio that’s higher than 82% of peers. Investors expect the company to sort out the kinks because Costco is so richly-valued. Thus, a slight snag can lead to rather sharp price declines for this stock. That said, I think this recent decline provides long-term investors with an opportunity. Costco is simply too strong a company to ignore. The company has a rich history of creating value as measured by an ROIC vs. WACC that proves Costco invests capital in a way that leads to consistent returns. Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comKroger (NYSE:KR) stock is one of the best grocery retail stocks to own in 2022. Food is a consumer staple with inelastic demand, and that is reflected in Kroger’s latest earnings which were released on Sept. 9.The Cincinnati company has seen sales increase throughout the first half of 2022. In Q2, sales increased 9.33% to $34.6 billion. Excluding fuel sales, overall revenue still increased by 5.8% in the quarter. It’s clear that Kroger is reacting strongly to the macro environment that continues to test consumers. Kroger’s in-store value line, Our Brands, achieved a 10.2% increase in sales during the second quarter. Additionally, shoppers are spending more on groceries as they look to save more money and cook more at home. The company has found itself in a strong position as it reacts to inflation that continues to have consumers concerned. Kroger appears to be very confident that the strategy it has pursued will continue to work. As a result, the company has raised full-year EPS guidance to a range between $3.95 and $4.05. Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) shares are currently as cheap as they’ve been in 2022. Consider it a great opportunity to buy the stock. The simple bull argument behind Coca-Cola is that this is a stock which is trading well below its lowest analyst target stock price. Currently, KO stock currently trades at $54.50. Among the 25 analysts with coverage, the low target price is $63. Coca-Cola last released earnings in late-July. The results were mixed, with sales remaining strong and increasing by 12%. However, costs increased and margins declined leading to EPS declining 28%, to 44 cents in the quarter. Coca-Cola shares appreciated in price following the news. And then, in mid-August, they turned downward and have since fallen to a new low price for 2022. That’s more a reflection of the current macro environment than it is a condemnation of KO stock. Thus, I think now is the time to buy KO stock for its dividend and capital appreciation upside. Let it sit, reinvest the dividend, and understand why so many have undertaken that strategy in the past. Sysco (SYY)Best Stocks for Students: Sysco (SYY)Source: ShutterstockSysco (NYSE:SYY) stock has declined a very modest 8.8% this year. The foodservice company that distributes products to restaurants, hospitals, and schools is holding up very well relative to the broader market.There were a lot of positives to be taken from its earnings report in August. Sales increased 17.5% on a year-over-year basis. Gross profit reached $3.4 billion, up 18.1%. And earnings per share hit 99 cents, up dramatically from the 29-cent EPS it reported during the same period in 2021. Sysco has shown rapid improvement moving out of the pandemic. Net earnings increased 126% and 60.6% in H1 and Q2, respectively. Sysco is still working through debt issues that affected it during the pandemic. However, it’s clear that Sysco remains a vitally important firm. Sysco is a foodservice distributor, and as such, its stock will remain attractive as a necessary link in the supply chain for consumer staples stocks. Bunge (BG)October 18, 2020, Brazil. In this photo illustration the B&amp;G Foods logo seen displayed on a smartphone. BGS stockSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comBunge (NYSE:BG) supplies oilseed, grain products, and related ingredients. In other words, Bunge is the company providing the basic ingredients that allow consumer staples companies to produce many of their goods. In a way, this is an upstream way to play the entire consumer staples sector. Currently, the company operates more than 300 port terminals, processing plants, and production facilities. These help put food onto tables. There’s something to be said about that.I personally like Bunge because it is a value-creating business as measured by its return on invested capital (ROIC) compared to the company’s weighted average cost of that capital (WACC). Firms whose ROIC exceeds their WACC are said to be value-creating. Bunge, with an ROIC of 9.82% and a WACC of 4.3%, is one of those firms. It is the kind of firm that Warren Buffett would tell investors to consider. It is also well-regarded by a Wall Street, which currently has it rated as an overwhelming buy. Part of this thesis relates to the ongoing war in Ukraine which has jolted wheat production, and part can be attributed to a rotation toward value stocks. Investors who decide to buy will have shares of a company with 50% upside baked into target prices. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

ADM.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top Research Reports for Alibaba, NextEra and Texas InstrumentsThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) and Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Alibaba shares have underperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (-55.4% vs. -43.0%). The company is facing the rising COVID-19 cases in China which continues to remain a serious headwind. We note that the pandemic-led disruptions are likely to persist as concerns for Alibaba’s domestic businesses.However, solid momentum across China and International wholesale businesses is benefiting its China and International commerce businesses, respectively. We expect China commerce and international commerce to be up 6.5% and 8.6% in fiscal 2023 year over year, respectively.Further, strength across the local consumer services, cloud computing business and Cainiao logistics services is contributing well to the top-line growth. Also, well-performing direct sales businesses like Alibaba Health and Freshippo remain tailwinds. Considering these factors, our estimates suggest that the top-line is likely to witness a 2.7% rise in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022.Story continues(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here &gt;&gt;&gt;)NextEra Energy shares have held up very well relative to the turmoil in the broader market, but they modestly underperformed the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry over the past year (-10.5% vs. -7.6%). The nature of its business is subject to complex federal, state and other regulations. Unfavorable weather conditions and an increase in supply costs adversely impact earnings as well.Nevertheless, through the proper execution of organic projects and strategic acquisitions, it is expanding its operations. NextEra Energy currently has a lot of renewable projects in its backlog and the renewable project backlog is rising every quarter, which is aiding the company in cutting emissions.The merger of Gulf Power and FPL strengthens NextEra Energy’s position in Florida. Improving the Florida economy and FPL’s reliable services are expanding its customer volume every quarter.

The company is facing weakness in the personal electronics market and remains a headwind. Further, intensifying market competition and coronavirus related uncertainties are concerns.However, Texas Instruments is benefiting from a solid rebound in the automotive market. Further, a solid demand environment in the industrial, communication equipment and enterprise systems markets is a major positive. Additionally, solid momentum across the Analog segment owing to robust signal chain and power product lines, is contributing well to the top line.Also, the robust Embedded Processing segment is contributing well. Notably, solid investments in new growth avenues and competitive advantages remain tailwinds. The company’s portfolio of long-lived products and efficient manufacturing strategies are other positives.(You can read the full research report on Texas Instrument here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Honeywell International Inc. and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

""And the Fed has sort of softened its tone a little bit over the past two months. They used to say that they could probably do this and achieve a softish [economic] landing. But now they've already said that there will be pain felt.

PM is likely to register top and bottom-line declines from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s readings when it reports third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $7,270 million, suggesting a decline of 10.5% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has declined by a cent in the past seven days to $1.36 per share, indicating around a 14% decline from the figure reported in the prior-year fiscal quarter. The tobacco giant has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.8%, on average. PM delivered an earnings surprise of 19.4% in the last reported quarter.We expect third-quarter net revenues to be down 13.7% year over year to $7,007.7 million and the bottom line to dip 1.7% to $1.55 a share.Philip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Philip Morris International Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteOn its second-quarter 2022 earnings call, management highlighted that it expects continued uncertainty concerning the recovery pace from the pandemic-led operating landscape, especially in the South &amp; Southeast Asia Regions in 2022. Management expects continued gradual recovery in the duty-free business outside Asia.Management stated that in 2022, the gross margin is expected to be lower due to a considerable rise in IQOS device volumes (with supply restrictions easing), the increased initial cost of IQOS ILUMA, elevated logistic costs, growth-oriented investments in the smoke-free space, raw material and energy cost inflation and incremental supply-chain costs. Also, the company expects a lower gross margin in the third quarter.While these aspects raise concerns for the quarter under review, strong pricing power has been working well for Philip Morris. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes. Further, strength in smoke-free net revenues, especially due to IQOS, remains an upside.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Philip Morris this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is the case here.Philip Morris has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.93%.

This powerful connection between heart and brain health is the target of a new initiative focused on clinical training, community and patient education, as well as diagnosis and treatment. Getting to the Heart of Stroke from the American Heart Association, the world’s leading nonprofit organization focused on heart and brain health for all, with support and collaboration from HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), one of the nation’s leading health care providers, and the HCA Healthcare Foundation, will also include individualized health education efforts in 15 local markets across the United States.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221017005116/en/Getting to the Heart of Stroke, developed in conjunction with HCA Healthcare and HCA Healthcare Foundation, features several efforts focused on preventing initial and recurrent strokes and improving overall stroke care by:Educating and deepening the collaboration between health care professionals, especially in neurology and cardiology.Empowering consumers to know and better manage their stroke risk, including through the use of a new stroke self-management tool, along with greater engagement with patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AFib) through the Association’s MyAFibExperience patient support network.Improving the overall health of communities by addressing disparities through local health impact work.Story continues""What’s good for the heart is good for the brain, but the reverse is also true: problems with the heart, including AFib, are well-documented as major stroke risk factors,"" said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association. ""To effectively combat stroke, we need to work together and elevate the heart-brain connection among health care professionals, while simultaneously addressing health disparities and resource gaps in our communities. We are not a one-size-fits-all nation and neither is the most successful approach to public health.""Getting to the Heart of Stroke focuses on education and care across medical disciplines and specialties and addresses risk factor management for people at highest risk of stroke from AFib—which is known to increase stroke risk by up to 5 times1—or secondary stroke from other undiagnosed heart issues.""Getting to the Heart of Stroke and our support of the American Heart Association further demonstrates our unwavering commitment to the individuals, families and communities we serve,"" said Sam Hazen, chief executive officer, HCA Healthcare and chairman, HCA Healthcare Foundation. ""Through this collaboration, we hope to have a significant impact in improving heart and brain health outcomes in order to beat stroke.""As part of the new initiative, American Heart Association staff and volunteer experts with support from the HCA Healthcare Foundation and HCA Healthcare community colleagues will work in 15 select communities (listed below) to implement community education. The nationwide initiative will also focus on stroke risk factor awareness and professional education projected through the lens of equitable health for all.Working closely with health care professional thought leaders, including those from HCA Healthcare, the Association will also develop accredited education programming that will be available to all health care professionals, and a specific learning collaborative with 10 HCA Healthcare facilities focused on continuously improving quality of care.""We are proud to be collaborating with the American Heart Association and recognize that increased education and connectivity between our neurology and cardiology health care teams, patients and communities are integral to reducing the devastation of stroke, determining its underlying cardiac causes, such as AFib and structural heart disease and preventing another one,"" said Steven Manoukian, MD, FAHA, senior vice president, HCA Healthcare. ""Through this unique and multi-faceted initiative with the AHA, everyone will become better at Getting to the Heart of Stroke.""Identifying the cause of a stroke is critical to being able to prevent a subsequent stroke. Certain patient subsets, including Black and Hispanic/Latino populations, face additional barriers to identifying and treating stroke risk factors as well as receiving thorough assessment and treatment following stroke2.While some AFib risk factors, including uncontrolled high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity, are more prevalent among Black people, they are less likely to be diagnosed with the condition, which may be related to race or ethnicity3. Black adults also have a higher prevalence of stroke and the highest death rate from stroke compared to any other racial group4. Getting to the Heart of Stroke will address these disparities through local health impact work in select communities. Focus areas may include women’s health and wellbeing, high blood pressure management, nutrition security or tobacco/vaping prevention.The local HCA Healthcare hospital systems participating in Getting to the Heart of Stroke are:ColoradoDenver – HealthONEFloridaGainesville/Ocala - HCA Florida HealthcareJacksonville - HCA Florida HealthcareOrlando - HCA Florida HealthcarePalm Beach - HCA Florida HealthcareSt. Petersburg/Tampa - HCA Florida HealthcareMissouriKansas City - HCA Midwest HealthNevadaLas Vegas - Sunrise HealthNorth CarolinaAsheville - Mission HealthTennesseeNashville – Tristar HealthTexasAustin – St. David’s HealthcareDallas/Fort Worth - Medical City HealthcareHouston/Gulf Coast - HCA Houston HealthcareSan Antonio - Methodist HealthcareVirginiaRichmond - HCA Virginia Health SystemAbout the American Heart AssociationThe American Heart Association is a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives.

PPG ranks #44 among the largest 250 U.S. public companies. The focus of the assessment is on workers’ access to role, wage and career advancement.""At PPG, we know our greatest strength is our people, who are focused on fulfilling our purpose and protecting and beautifying the world every day. We protect their well-being and ensure our employees are safe, healthy, engaged and valued for the diverse talents they bring to PPG,"" said Kevin Walling, PPG vice president and chief human resources officer. ""Our inclusion in the American Opportunity Index recognizes our efforts to make opportunities available regardless of education, as well as our competitive wages and benefits.""The index, developed by Harvard Business School’s Project on Managing the Future of Work, the Burning Glass Institute and the Schultz Family Foundation, measures which companies are most likely to create opportunities for workers in roles open to non-college graduates across three criteria: access (who is able to join the company); wage (how well they are paid); and mobility (how far a worker will advance—either at that company or once they leave for another company). PPG scored top marks in providing a career launchpad - hiring workers without experience, training them, and enabling them to move on to better positions – and growing talent - filling roles by promoting from within, and whose managers and executives are mostly likely to have risen from within.PPG has more than 6,000 positions in the U.S. that do not require a college degree, of which the vast majority are in sales, retail and at manufacturing and distribution center locations. The company offers a variety of education, training, networking and advancement opportunities, including:Story continuesProviding specific on-the-job trainings for different roles. For example, in manufacturing plants there is a series of process trainings.Offering access to a PPG-run mentoring platform and PPG’s online Learning Management System with nearly 25,000 digital learning resources.Supporting and funding PPG’s eight Employee Resource Networks (ERN).Offering tuition reimbursement for continuing education and certifications.Making available various external platforms, including LinkedIn Learning, Rosetta Stone for language skills, and Udemy for upskilling in areas of interest.In addition to the American Opportunity Index, PPG has been recently recognized for its employment efforts in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index, Forbes Best Employers for Women, Forbes 2022 America’s Best Employers, FORTUNE World’s Most Admired Companies list.PPG’s ranking of #44 is based on its overall index score, which is a weighted average of nine measurements of opportunity a company affords workers or helps create beyond it, based on access to work it provides, ability to advance within the company, and wages.PPG: WE PROTECT AND BEAUTIFY THE WORLD™At PPG (NYSE:PPG), we work every day to develop and deliver the paints, coatings and materials that our customers have trusted for nearly 140 years.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 2.65% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 1.86%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.24%.Coming into today, shares of the world's largest oilfield services company had gained 9.88% in the past month. In that same time, the Oils-Energy sector lost 4.88%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 8.99%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Schlumberger as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 21, 2022. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.55, up 52.78% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.14 billion, up 22.17% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.03 per share and revenue of $27.25 billion. These totals would mark changes of +58.59% and +18.85%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Schlumberger. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.52% higher within the past month. Schlumberger currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).In terms of valuation, Schlumberger is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 20.8. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 20.83, so we one might conclude that Schlumberger is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that SLB currently has a PEG ratio of 0.49. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Oil and Gas - Field Services was holding an average PEG ratio of 0.64 at yesterday's closing price.The Oil and Gas - Field Services industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 20, which puts it in the top 8% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

The outlook is bullish this time thanks to the upbeat oil market. Let’s delve into the earnings potential of the big six banking companies that could regulate the performance of the sector ahead.According to our methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive  Earnings ESP increases our chances of predicting an earnings beat, while companies with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter.Investors should note that oil prices have been among the most-typed investment words this year. United States Oil Fund, LP USO has advanced 29% this year but lost 4.8% in the past three months (as of Oct 14, 2022).Factors like easing Omicron concerns, supply shortages, and geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East have thus boosted oil prices this year. Russia is oil rich and hence West’s abandonment of Russia has made the supply matter worse and boosted oil prices. The recent OPEC+ output cut is another positive for the space.Inside Our Surprise PredictionSchlumberger SLB is likely to report on Oct 21. SLB has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of +0.23%.Halliburton HAL is likely to report on Oct 25. HAL has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +1.54%.What’s in Store This Earnings Season?As discussed above, the chances of a broad-based earnings beat are higher, thanks to higher oil prices. This has been reflected in the latest earnings estimates too, with Halliburton’s current quarter EPS estimate of $0.56 rising from $0.54 three months ago.The current-quarter EPS expectation for Schlumberger has gained from $0.51 three months ago to $0.55 now.ETFs in FocusSchlumberger has exposure to ETFs like iShares U.S. Oil Equipment &amp; Services ETF IEZ (21.91% exposure), VanEck Oil Services ETF OIH (19.34% exposure) and Invesco Dynamic Oil &amp; Gas Services ETF PXJ (5.19% exposure).Story continuesHalliburton too has the same exposure. iShares U.S. Oil Equipment &amp; Services ETF (with 21.97% exposure), VanEck Oil Services ETF (OIH) (with 12.22% exposure) and Invesco Dynamic Oil &amp; Gas Services ETF (PXJ) (with 5.14% exposure) are top three ETFs that are heavily-focused on Halliburton.What Lies in Q4?Recessionary fears are rife. The Fed raised interest rates several times this year and signaled continued tightening ahead, which could further weigh on risk-on trade sentiments.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales is pinned at $2.21 billion, indicating a 10.3% rise from the year-ago quarter’s levels.Factors at PlayPackaging products are essential for distributing food, beverage and pharmaceutical products. Ongoing strong demand for packaging of meat, fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, medicine and other consumer products is expected to have aided the Packaging segment’s September quarter’s performance. This segment accounts for around 91% of PKG’s revenues.  Demand for containerboard and corrugated products remains strong across most of PKG’s end markets.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s quarterly revenues is pegged at $2,024 million, calling for growth of 11% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. The consensus mark for the segment’s operating income is pinned at $376 million, indicating growth of 1% from the prior-year tally.Management stated that it expects higher scheduled outage costs at the International Falls paper mill for the third quarter as it postponed the scheduled outage due to excessive flooding in the area prior to the outage. This might have dented the Paper segment’s sales volume in the September quarter. Also, the paper segment was impacted unfavorably by dismal paper demand due to the rising preference for electronic data transmission, e-readers and electronic document storage alternatives, and the declining North American uncoated freesheet market. These are likely to be reflected in Packaging Corp’s performance in the quarter to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Paper segment’s revenues stands at $143 million for the September quarter, suggesting a decline of 5% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s operating income is pinned at $20.3 million, indicating a 66% increase from the prior-year quarter’s $12.2 million.Persistent rail service challenges and rail fuel surcharges resulted in higher freight and logistics expenses in the September quarter.  Packaging Corp continued to face inflation in most of its operating and converting costs. These factors along with higher gas, chemical prices and higher labor costs are expected to have negatively impacted PKG’s margins during the third quarter.Story continuesWhat Our Model IndicatesOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Packaging Corp this season.

130,b22c1728-d12c-368d-933d-8a29979bc074,PKG,2022-10-18,Packaging Corp. (PKG) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/packaging-corp-pkg-earnings-expected-140002311.html,1666015202,STORY,['PKG'],"[Packaging Corp. (PKG) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of containerboard and corrugated packaging products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.84 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.6%.Revenues are expected to be $2.21 billion, up 10.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.64% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Packaging Corp.For Packaging Corp.The Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.35%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Packaging Corp. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Packaging Corp. Would post earnings of $2.87 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.23, delivering a surprise of +12.54%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Packaging Corp. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

131,3202ce75-2402-36cc-b68b-9dff7d721c58,APTV,2022-10-18,2 “Strong Buy” Stocks for a Tax-Loss Harvesting Haul,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-strong-buy-stocks-tax-184753009.html,1666032473,STORY,"['BAC', 'APTV']","[As we get down toward the end of the year, hedge funds and large-scale individual investors have a habit of shedding their losing positions, swallowing the losses now to offset them against capital gains taxes on their profitable holdings. The trades are called tax-loss harvesting, and they open up an interesting opportunity for the daring retail investor.The opportunity comes due to a statistical quirk of trading history noted by Savita Subramanian, Bank of America’s head of US equity strategy. She points out “a higher potential for a bigger subsequent bounce in these stocks following the selling.”These stocks, that have lead the losers through the year, tend to outperform from November through January. In fact, according to Subramanian’s analysis, in years when the S&amp;P 500 has seen a negative return through October, the tax-loss harvesting stocks have outperformed the markets during November to January 100% of the time, by an average of 8.2%. The S&amp;P 500 is down 23% so far this year.Against this backdrop, Subramanian has identified 159 buy-rated stocks that fit the bill. Using TipRanks' database, we narrowed down the list to 2 names that boast Strong Buy ratings from the rest of the Street. Let's take a closer look.Aptiv PLC (APTV)The first stock we’ll look at is Aptiv, an automotive technology company formed when Delphi, one of Detroit’s biggest names in the powertrain supply chain, divested itself of the powertrain and aftermarket auto parts business segments in 2017. The sold-off segments became a division of the transmission giant Borg Warner, while the remainder of the company rebranded as Aptiv and change its focus to automotive tech platforms, including on-road computing and network, and the software packages to enable connected and/or autonomous vehicles. Aptiv’s range of automotive solutions now includes software architecture for connection systems, electrical distribution, vehicle electrification, and smart vehicle capabilities.Story continuesWhile Aptiv traces its roots to Detroit, and the ‘Motor City’s’ legendary auto industry, the company now works in 46 countries and boasts 12 technical centers and 127 manufacturing facilities around the world.Quarterly revenues since the end of 2020 have been stable at or near $4 billion. The most recent quarterly report, for 2Q22, showed a top line of $4.1 billion, up from $3.8 billion, or 7% year-over-year. However, earnings per diluted share came in at 22 cents, down sharply from the year-ago result of 60 cents EPS.Like many others, Aptiv hasn't had a great year, with shares falling 48% since the start of 2022. But things aren’t as bad as they may seem, argues Berenberg Bank analyst Jared Maymon, who sees a clear path forward for Aptiv.“In our view, Aptiv’s investments in high-voltage electrification, active safety, and user experience are beginning to pay off as OEMs produce more electric vehicles; as a result, we believe APTV is well-positioned to capture meaningful share of an expanded TAM in the long run... In our view, APTV’s Signal &amp; Power Solutions (SPS) content per vehicle (CPV) is rising from ~$500 in internal combustion engine vehicles (ICE) to ~$1,100 in EV’s, which should lead to annual growth over market (GoM) of 4%-6% through 2026E,” Maymon opined.These comments are clearly bullish, and Maymon uses them to hold up his Buy rating on the stock. His price target, now set at $130, suggests a one-year gain of 54% is in the offing for Aptiv. (To watch Maymon’s track record, click here)Overall, there are 13 recent analyst reviews for APTV shares, and they break down to 11 Buys and just 2 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock has a trading price of $85.27 and its $136.67 average price target implies ~60% upside in the next 12 months. (See APTV stock forecast on TipRanks)EPAM Systems, Inc. (EPAM)From automotive systems, we’ll now switch our focus to custom software and system design, engineering, and consulting services. EPAM boasts that it can reimagine any company through a ‘digital lens,’ and that it has partnered with over 160 tech firms around the world to deliver cutting edge solutions. EPAM operated in 50 countries, claims more than 280 of the Forbes 2000 firms among its customer base.This software firm was heading ever upward since its 2012 public debut. It posted more than $2 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2019, saw that grow to $2.65 billion in 2020, and saw it jump again to $3.76 billion in 2021. The firm took a major hit, however, earlier this year, when Russia invaded Ukraine. EPAM is based in the US and Belarus, and at the end of 2021 it was employing more than 12,000 workers in Ukraine. Shares in EPAM fell sharply after the Russian invasion, and have not yet recovered. EPAM stock is down 49% for this year so far.Even though the stock is down, EPAM has continued to post strong revenues. In 1Q22, the company showed a top line of $1.17 billion, and that was up to $1.195 billion for 2Q22. Year-over-year, the 2Q revenues were up 35%. Earnings results were mixed, however. The GAAP EPS showed a drop of 83% y/y, to 32 cents per diluted share, while the non-GAAP earnings were up 16% y/y, from $2.05 per diluted share to $2.38. The company does have deep pockets, however; even after burning 10% of its cash holdings in 1H22, EPAM still reported having $1.29 billion in cash and liquid assets available at the end of the second quarter.All of this has caught the attention of 5-star analyst James Faucette of Morgan Stanley, who remains bullish on the IT firm despite freely acknowledging the risks it faces with so much exposure to the conflict in Eastern Europe.“Despite the challenging operating environment, demand continues to be robust for EPAM’s services, driven largely by the secular trends we’ve seen over the last year, with project work around modernization of applications, movement to the cloud, data analytics, and platform engineering, among others,"" Faucette noted.“We remain constructive on EPAM’s execution abilities around recruiting and delivery, as well as the company’s ability to deliver compounding growth going forward. We continue to believe that EPAM is among the best-positioned IT Services companies to benefit from digital transformation spending given its 100% digital exposure, agile development-focused nearshore workforce, and disciplined acquisition-focused capital allocation strategy,"" the analyst added.Looking forward, Faucette rates EPAM shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and sets a $480 price target that implies a 42% upside over the course of the coming year. (To watch Faucette’s track record, click here)The Morgan Stanley view on EPAM is no outlier; all 11 of the recent analyst reviews are positive, for a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus. The average price target of $470, with the trading price of $338.29, gives a one-year upside potential of ~39%.

133,2e8bf31c-5a3d-328c-ae8d-e08fb3640285,HOLX,2022-10-18,"Investors Heavily Search Hologic, Inc. (HOLX): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-hologic-inc-130001692.html,1666011601,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this medical device maker have returned -6.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Hologic belongs, has lost 12.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.62 per share, indicating a change of -61.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -30.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.49 indicates a change of -40% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Hologic is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Hologic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $866.83 million indicates a year-over-year change of -34.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $4.78 billion and $3.79 billion estimates indicate -15.2% and -20.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -14.2%. EPS of $0.95 for the same period compares with $1.33 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $896.2 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +11.88%. The EPS surprise was +37.68%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The key is pleasing members. It’s why we’ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us.""The company attributed its success in the quarter to several TV and film hits, including ""Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,"" ""Stranger Things S4,"" ""Extraordinary Attorney Woo,"" ""The Gray Man,"" and ""Purple Hearts.""Additionally, Netflix noted its streaming prowess relative to competitors, writing, ""Our competitors are investing heavily to drive subscribers and engagement, but building a large, successful streaming business is hard - we estimate they are all losing money, with combined 2022 operating losses well over $10 billion, vs. Netflix's $5 to $6 billion annual operating profit.""""Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" (Courtesy: Netflix)Tuesday's earnings marked the first time this year the company has added subscribers, which mostly came from outside of the United States. In the first and second quarters, the company lost 200,000 and 970,000 subscribers, respectively.The company said it will stop giving guidance on paid memberships moving forward due to its introduction of new revenue streams. For now, though, it estimated an addition of 4.5 million subscribers next quarter (above prior forecasts of 3.9 million.)Story continuesTo help stem earlier subscriber losses, the company plans to launch an ad-supported subscription tier in November.Most analysts have remained bullish on the profitability aspects of the new ad tier.UBS analyst John Hodulik recently upped his price target on the stock by $52 to $250 a share, and JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth said that the ad tier's lower price point ($6.99 in the U.S.) indicates Netflix's confidence in advertising revenue.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet (who maintains a Buy rating on the stock) said that the upcoming ad tier ""could point to material upside"" in free cash flow, and Evercore ISI's Mark Mahaney predicted that ad-supported will bring in $1 to $2 billion in incremental revenue by 2024.On a call prior to the ad tier announcement, Netflix Worldwide Advertising President Jeremi Gorman said the platform ""nearly sold out all of its [ad] inventory"" globally for launch — bucking the trend of a global ad spend slowdown.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Despite the earnings beat, the company lowered its guidance, citing foreign exchange (FX) headwinds as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against most major currencies.""Based on our YTD actuals and Q4 guidance, we estimate that this appreciation since January 1, 2022 will negatively impact our full year 2022 revenue and operating income by ~$1 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively,"" the company noted in the release.Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Food Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

To skip our detailed analysis of the obesity epidemic and its effects on the weight loss and fitness industry in 2022, go directly and see 5 Best Weight Loss Stocks To Buy Now.The 21st century has seen obesity emerge as one of the largest health concerns across the globe. According to a report by McKinsey and Company, more than 30% of the global population is struggling with obesity. It is responsible for more than 5% of worldwide deaths, and if the prevalence of the epidemic continues, more than half of the world's population will be classified as 'obese' by 2030. However, the economic impact of the epidemic is rarely talked about. Obesity, along with other human activities like armed conflict, war and terrorism, has one of the greatest negative impacts on the global economy. Not only does it inflict immense pressure on healthcare sectors in terms of cost and spending, with obesity prevention taking up more than 7% of global healthcare budget, it also hampers overall economic gains. The increasing awareness about the crisis, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, has prompted an entire wave of millennials and Gen-Z consumers to engage with the weight loss and fitness industry.The obesity crisis offers a huge opportunity to investors who are currently struggling with the macroeconomic headwinds perpetrated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, rise in energy prices, supply chain disruptions, rising interest rates, and tightening monetary policies. The IMF is expected to lower the global growth forecast for the fourth time this year in October 2022, and the warning signs of a possible recession are already on the horizon. Even in such tough macroeconomic conditions, a report by McKinsey and Company finds that the market for health, wellness products, and fitness is growing by 5% to 10% per year, varying region to region. The industry was revolutionized during the COVID-19 pandemic, when huge swaths of people were constrained within their homes, catalyzing a large-scale shift towards personalized, at-home workouts, making weight loss and fitness even more important. Fitness tech apps raised a mammoth $2 billion in investments in 2020. As a result, a recent survey has revealed a shift in popular conceptions of fitness and weight loss, with more than 40% of the general population recognizing and regarding health as a top priority in 2022. This spells great things for the weight loss and fitness market in the coming years.Story continues Currently, the weight loss and fitness industry is shifting from navigating through the pandemic to thriving in the normal, building consumer relationships which can last and grow. The health and fitness market is set to grow at a CAGR of 7.21% through to 2027. The current market size for the industry, measured by revenue, is more than $1.5 trillion in 2022, with estimated growth rates of more than 5% to 10% in 2023. Fitness companies that have incorporated a digital model in their services have generated a collective revenue growth of 40.61% in 2021.Some of the most prominent weight loss stocks in the world are Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), and Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF).

(NYSE:NLS) to $4 from $5, maintaining a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst attributed the lower price target to macroeconomic pressures and skyrocketing interest rates.

Investor interest around Nautilus Inc. (NYSE:NLS) has also increased, with 13 hedge funds having stakes worth $5.83 million in Q2 2022. This is up from 11 hedge funds which were long the stock in Q1 2022.Here is what Olstein Capital Management had to say about Nautilus Inc. (NYSE:NLS) in their Q4 2021 investor letter:“During the reporting period, the Fund initiated and eliminated its position in multi-brand fitness company, Nautilus Inc. (NYSE:NLS).

(NYSE:MED) shares are priced particularly cheaply. The company is also big on dividend payouts, having an annual dividend yield of 5.54% and a quarterly dividend amount of $1.64 per share.Here is what Miller Howard Investments had to say about Medifast's (NYSE:MED) performance during and post the pandemic in their Q3 2021 investor letter:“AFTER A METEORIC RISE OVER THE PAST YEAR, small-cap stocks reversed course with the Russell 2000 Index down -4.4% for the quarter. Much of the downdraft was focused on stocks that had done well in the pandemic environment but lost favor with investors who see a recovery on the horizon. Our largest detractors have all benefitted from pandemic-driven demand. Medifast (NYSE:MED) , a provider of weight loss programs and our second biggest detractor, traded off this quarter over worries that their success has been bolstered by people working from home.”7. WW International Inc. (NASDAQ:WW) Hedge Fund Holdings: 20Headquartered in New York City, WW International (NASDAQ:WW) is a global company which provides weight loss, maintenance, fitness, and mindset services, an example being the Weight Watchers comprehensive diet program.

The analyst also has positive expectations from the new CEO, who is curtailing unnecessary spending and streamlining product lines.Although the company's revenue stream and share price have taken a hit due to major shifts in consumers' dietary preferences, WW International (NASDAQ:WW) is still in profit and posts generous cash flows, which they have been using to alleviate external debt load and thereby, steer clear of the rising interest rates entirely. With operational costs continually lowering, projected growth is solid, albeit far in the future. Management has projected a 4% growth in sales and a 2% increase in earnings-per-share in 2023.6. Planet Fitness Inc.

Despite the massive sell-off of 23% in the stock in 25 trading sessions, which was guided by a relatively slow 2022, the analyst contends that Planet Fitness' (NYSE:PLNT) low-cost value proposition will prove to be extremely beneficial for the company's growing customer base. Krotthapalli explains how the current bottlenecks in the market are only a temporary hiccup caused by macroeconomic headwinds and asserts that like Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), and Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF), the company is well-leveraged to navigate through the crisis, making for an attractive investment for the long-term investor.

(NASDAQ:VTRS)Callodine Capital Management’s Stake Value: $11,269,000 Percentage of Callodine Capital Management’s 13F Portfolio: 3.33% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS) is a global healthcare organization. The firm has 1,400 authorized medicinal compounds in its portfolio and develops and distributes a range of medications. In addition, it owns branded medications such as Lipitor, Xanax, and Viagra, complicated generics, bio-similars, over-the-counter medications, and pharmaceutical components.

Here is what the fund said:“Davis Global Fund added several new positions over the past year, including the pharmaceutical Viatris. Viatris is an unloved global pharmaceutical manufacturer created through the merger of Mylan and Upjohn (Pfizer’s off-patent drugs business). The company is highly diversified, with leading positions across a wide span of generic and specialty/partnered drugs in many countries around the world. While growth for the portfolio overall is moderated by pricing pressures in traditional generics, Viatris has an attractive pipeline of complex drugs (e.g., inhaled drugs, injectables, etc.) and biosimilars, the latter of which are poised to see growth in the years ahead after a long period of regulatory and legal deadlock in the U.S.Near-term, Viatris is committed to using free cash flow to pay down debt, but we believe its extremely cheap valuation (4–5x owner earnings) and growing cash generation offers a compelling risk/reward proposition that should eventually be recognized by the market.”8.

(NYSE:KKR). Here is what the firm said:“We reinitiated a position in KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR), an alternative asset manager that we have previously owned, after a recent significant fall in its stock price. Much like our current Blackstone holding, most of KKR’s investor capital is long-dated or even permanent (perpetual capital is currently $165 billion, 43% of its fee-paying assets under management), most of their fees (which are highmargin and recurring) are not sensitive to the stock market (fee-paying AUM was $371 billion for 1Q22, up 29% year over year, helping to generate $605 million of fees, up 66% year-overyear), and the company has billions of dollars of uninvested capital available to put to work (KKR has $115 billion of “dry powder” or uncalled capital commitments, an increase of 66% year over year). This combination of large and growing AUM that generates recurring fees, along with the company’s stellar history of opportunistic investing and harvesting, offers a fantastic combination of consistent fee based recurring earnings with the potential for substantial incentive fee upside over time. As with Blackstone, we believe this combination provides a strong foundation for long-term stock performance. Along with the broader markets, KKR’s stock has come under significant pressure over the last several months (falling nearly 40% from its recent November 2021 peak) affording us the opportunity to re-invest in the company at what we believe to be an extremely compelling valuation.”7.

For the first six months of 2022, oil was up 41%, natural gas up 45%, natural gas liquids up 34%, and the futures curve for electricity (in the two biggest deregulated power markets) is up ~30%, but our holdings were only up a measly ~1% by mid-year!

150,44f749f4-200b-3955-82e2-6dd26e4eef5d,NOV,2022-10-18,U.S. natgas futures hold at 3-month low on milder weather forecasts,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-natgas-futures-hold-3-122553546.html,1666095953,STORY,['NG=F'],"[Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures held near a three-month low as forecasts for milder weather through the end of October offset forecasts for higher demand than previously expected. Gas futures have been declining for eight weeks on record output and reduced liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports that have allowed utilities to inject much bigger than normal amounts of gas into storage over the past month. Major LNG outages include Berkshire Hathaway Energy's shutdown of its 0.8-billion-cubic-feet-per-day (bcfd) Cove Point LNG export plant in Maryland for about three weeks of planned maintenance on Oct. 1 and the continuing shutdown of Freeport LNG's 2.0-bcfd plant in Texas for unplanned work after an explosion on June 8. Freeport expects the facility to return to at least partial service in early to mid-November. At least three vessels were heading to Freeport, according to Refinitiv data, including Prism Brilliance (expected to arrive Oct. 18), Prism Diversity (Oct. 27) and Seapeak Methane (Nov. 22), prompting some traders to believe Freeport will return in November. Others in the market, however, believe the plant's return will be delayed. Officials at Freeport said they remain on track to return the plant in November. U.S. LNG exports could start to rise later this week if Cove Point returns to service as some traders expect. Front-month gas futures remained unchanged at $5.999 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 7:59 a.m. EDT (1159 GMT), the same as on Monday when the contract closed at its lowest price since July 6. Despite recent declines, U.S. futures are still up about 61% so far this year as soaring global gas prices feed demand for U.S. exports due to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Gas was trading at $34 per mmBtu in Europe and $31 in Asia. That puts European forwards down about 8% for the day and on track for their lowest close since June 14 as strong LNG imports boosted the amount of gas in storage in Northwest Europe to healthy levels above 90% of capacity. European prices hit an all-time high of $90.91 on Aug. 25. During the first nine months of 2022, roughly 60%, or 6.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), of U.S. LNG exports went to Europe, as shippers diverted cargoes from Asia to fetch higher prices. Last year, just 29%, or about 2.8 bcfd, of U.S. LNG exports went to Europe. TOP PRODUCER U.S. gas futures lag far behind global prices because the United States is the world's top producer with all the fuel it needs for domestic use, while capacity constraints and the Freeport outage prevent the country from exporting more LNG. Data provider Refinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states has risen to 99.6 bcfd so far in October, up from a monthly record of 99.4 bcfd in September. With milder weather coming, Refinitiv projected average U.S. gas demand, including exports, would fall from 101.0 bcfd this week to 95.9 bcfd next week. Those forecasts were higher than Refinitiv's outlook on Monday. The average amount of gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants has fallen to 11.0 bcfd so far in October from 11.5 bcfd in September. That compares with a monthly record of 12.9 bcfd in March. The seven big U.S. export plants can turn about 13.8 bcfd of gas into LNG.

His administration has considered a ban on exports of US gas, and Biden himself has called on gas station operators to immediately cut prices.Gas prices spiked above $5 a gallon in June as western sanctions against Russia squeezed crude oil supplies. They dropped to $3.87 a gallon Tuesday, according to data from the AAA.The price of gas has been lower in recent days, after starting to rise for the first time in 99 days last month. That reversal of a steady decline came after the Biden administration began releasing the record amount of crude oil from the SPR.The OPEC+ decision to slash production quotas has prompted speculation about whether the White House would respond with more drawdowns to replace some of the missing supply. Some investors worry the US could flood the market with another 100 million barrels.Story continuesBut the SPR is meant to supply oil in emergencies, rather than being used to ease pressure on prices, Energy Aspects' Amrita Sen told CNBC.The SPR is now ""absolutely being used to keep prices lower, even though that's not what it's meant to be used for.""Oil prices fell early Tuesday but recovered somewhat to trade around the flatline. Brent crude futures were at $91.80 a barrel, while WTI crude futures traded at $85.56.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

(NYSE:ZTS) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At ZoetisIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Catherine Knupp, sold US$2.2m worth of shares at a price of US$217 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$150). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last year Zoetis insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does Zoetis Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 0.07% of Zoetis shares, worth about US$48m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Do The Zoetis Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Zoetis shares in the last quarter. Our analysis of Zoetis insider transactions leaves us cautious. But it's good to see that insiders own shares in the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example - Zoetis has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Story continuesBut note: Zoetis may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

159,a01c0c23-fd06-3939-83ca-0dc415f89bc2,NEE,2022-10-18,"NextEra Energy, Inc.'s (NYSE:NEE) recent 4.0% pullback adds to one-year year losses, institutional owners may take drastic measures",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-energy-inc-nyse-nee-120104773.html,1666094464,STORY,"['NEE', 'NEE-PR']","[To get a sense of who is truly in control of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 79% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 4.0% last week. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 7.2% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell NextEra Energy, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about NextEra Energy. View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NextEra Energy?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that NextEra Energy does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NextEra Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. NextEra Energy is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.4% of shares outstanding. With 7.4% and 5.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of NextEra EnergyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that NextEra Energy, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$238m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 21% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand NextEra Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for NextEra Energy that you should be aware of before investing here.Ultimately the future is most important.

The company is facing the rising COVID-19 cases in China which continues to remain a serious headwind. We note that the pandemic-led disruptions are likely to persist as concerns for Alibaba’s domestic businesses.However, solid momentum across China and International wholesale businesses is benefiting its China and International commerce businesses, respectively. We expect China commerce and international commerce to be up 6.5% and 8.6% in fiscal 2023 year over year, respectively.Further, strength across the local consumer services, cloud computing business and Cainiao logistics services is contributing well to the top-line growth. Also, well-performing direct sales businesses like Alibaba Health and Freshippo remain tailwinds.

Unfavorable weather conditions and an increase in supply costs adversely impact earnings as well.Nevertheless, through the proper execution of organic projects and strategic acquisitions, it is expanding its operations.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK)Berkshire Hathaway's Stake Value: $3,018,027,000 Dividend Yield as of October 17: 3.67%The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) is an American investment banking holding company that provides related services to its consumers.

First Eagle Investment Management was one of the company's leading stakeholders in Q2.Ariel Investments mentioned The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Rising interest rates, after a surprisingly long period of low absolute rates and negative “real” rates, will create a headwind. While there has been much debate about the cause of these low rates, we believe the most important factor has been the $120 billion in monthly federal reserve open market bond purchases and the accumulation of an $8 trillion balance sheet. The former will end, and the latter will shrink. It is not just the Fed that has aggressively purchased bonds, bidding up prices and lowering yields. Bond traders and hedge fund managers have added to positions, confident that being on the same side as the Fed was the wise place to be. Now as the Fed is about to become a seller of bonds rather than a buyer, Wall Street’s “smart money” is likely to follow suit. Against this backdrop, fixed income securities and bond substitutes such as high dividend paying utilities and absolute return hedge funds are substantially overpriced and are not likely to produce attractive returns going forward.This expectation of a reversion to the mean for interest rates helped 2021 performance, though not as much as we had hoped. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury did indeed increase from +0.92% at the beginning of the year to +1.52% at year-end. An underreported story was the poor performance of bonds last year. The Barclays Aggregate Index declined -1.67% for the year ending December compared to a return of +28.71% for equities as measured by the S&amp;P 500. Interest rates have continued to climb in 2022 with the 10-year Treasury at +1.79% as we go to print. This move higher in rates has contributed to our good, early start to 2022. Smaller positions in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) also benefited from higher rates, principally with their ability to invest customer cash.”7.

The bottom line represents a rise of 11% from the prior-year quarter.Shares of BK gained 4.9% in pre-market trading on better-than-expected earnings. The full-day trading session will display a clearer picture.Results have been aided by a rise in net interest revenues. However, asset balances witnessed a decline, which was a negative. Also, higher expenses hurt the results to some extent.Net income applicable to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $319 million or 39 cents per share, down from $881 million or $1.04 per share recorded in the year-ago quarter.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseTotal revenues grew 6% year over year to $4.28 billion. The top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.18 billion.Net interest revenues, on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, were $929 million, up 44.3% year over year. The rise reflected higher interest rates on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding expenses and lower interest-earning assets.The net interest margin (FTE basis) expanded 37 basis points (bps) year over year to 1.05%.Total fee and other revenues declined 1.2% to $3.35 billion. The decline was due to a fall in investment management and performance fees, financing-related fees, and investment and other revenues.Total non-interest expenses (GAAP basis) were $3.68 billion, up 26.1% year over year. The rise was due to an increase in almost all cost components, except for sub-custodian and clearing costs, costs related to the amortization of intangible assets, and other expenses.Asset Balances DeclineAs of Sep 30, 2022, assets under management were $1.78 trillion, down 22.9% year over year. The decline was due to lower market values and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by net inflows.Assets under custody and/or administration of $42.2 trillion declined 6.8%, primarily reflecting lower market values and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by client inflows and net new business.Credit Quality ImprovesAllowance for loan losses, as a percentage of total loans, was 0.23%, down 13 bps from the prior-year quarter.In the reported quarter, the company recorded provision benefits of $30 million compared with $45 million in the year-ago quarter. As of Sep 30, 2022, non-performing assets were $107 million, down 1% year over year.Capital Position DeterioratesAs of Sep 30, 2022, the common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.1%, down from 11.8% as of Sep 30, 2021. Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.4%, down from 5.7% as of Sep 30, 2021.Our TakeHigher interest rates, BNY Mellon’s global footprint and a strong balance sheet position are likely to keep supporting revenue growth in the near term. However, concentration risks, arising from significant dependence on fee-based revenues, are major concerns. Recessionary fears are expected to put additional pressure on the company's asset values (which witnessed a decline in the third quarter).The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation QuoteCurrently, BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The results included $959 million or 24 cents of net investment securities losses in the Corporate segment.As expected, the performance of JPM’s investment banking business was hugely disappointing. In the quarter, operating expenses recorded a rise. Nevertheless, higher interest rates and a solid rise in loan balance aided the bank’s net interest income.U.S. Bancorp USB reported third-quarter 2022 earnings per share (excluding merger and integration-related charges) of $1.18, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1.17 per share. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.30 per share.USB’s results were primarily aided by increased net interest income, supported by higher interest rates and loan growth. However, a decline in non-interest income and higher expenses were the undermining factors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is expected to be November 14, 2022. In that report, analysts expect Tyson Foods to post earnings of $1.74 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 24.35%.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Mastercard has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for Mastercard peKeen to find out how analysts think Mastercard's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Enough Growth For Mastercard?Mastercard's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 37% gain to the company's bottom line. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 54% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 18% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.5% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Mastercard is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Final WordUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesWe've established that Mastercard maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.You should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for Mastercard  you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 74% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 9.1% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 14% for shareholders. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell QUALCOMM which might hurt individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about QUALCOMM. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About QUALCOMM?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in QUALCOMM. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at QUALCOMM's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in QUALCOMM. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.5% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.3% and 4.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of QUALCOMMThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of QUALCOMM Incorporated. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$142m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 26% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand QUALCOMM better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with QUALCOMM (at least 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Ultimately the future is most important.

186,fb7cf127-0e1c-3cd9-bc4a-641b31a2d404,QCOM,2022-10-18,Investors Heavily Search QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-qualcomm-incorporated-130001734.html,1666011601,STORY,['QCOM'],"[Qualcomm (QCOM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this chipmaker have returned -12% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9% change. The Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, to which Qualcomm belongs, has lost 12% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $3.15 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +23.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $12.55 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +47%. This estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.69 indicates a change of +1.1% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Qualcomm is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for QCOM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $11.38 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.9%. The $44.17 billion and $46.5 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +31.6% and +5.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryQualcomm reported revenues of $10.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +35.7%. EPS of $2.96 for the same period compares with $1.92 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.88 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.5%. The EPS surprise was +3.5%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Qualcomm is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In July, Lockheed revised the figure down from $66 billion.In an interview with Reuters, chief financial officer Jay Malave said that next year ""in spite of sales and margin pressure, we believe that we can still deliver the same absolute free cash flow that we had talked about last year, and had guided, so that's about $6.1 billion.""That, coupled with a fresh $14 billion multiyear share repurchase authorization plan adopted on Monday, means Malave expects earnings per share to increase in 2023.The Bethesda, Maryland-based company posted $6.71 in earnings per diluted share for the quarter, versus analysts' estimates of $6.67, according to Refinitiv data.Still, pandemic-related supply chain challenges have continued, Malave said. Lockheed's largest unit, aeronautics, which also makes the F-16 jet, was hit by difficulties obtaining key components in the first part of the year, hampering production volume.Compared to the same quarter a year ago sales at aeronautics, which makes the F-35, rose 7.6% to $7.1 billion. Profit margins in the unit fell slightly from 10.9% to 10.7% compared with the same quarter last year.The F-35 has had several recent successes in jet fighter competitions, including Finland, Switzerland and Germany. Potential customers include Greece and the Czech Republic.Story continuesSales at the Missiles and Fire Control unit, which makes HIMARS launchers, were up 1.8% to $2.83 billion, but profit margins fell slightly compared with the same quarter a year ago.Malave said Lockheed has not been in discussions about the Defense Production Act, an emergency authority the U.S. government can use to direct arms production, to speed up weapons deliveries to Ukraine. And despite recent turbulence between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia over a cut to oil production, Malave said Lockheed had not been asked to alter deliveries to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.(Reporting by Mike Stone in Washington.

Capital expenditures were $405 million, resulting in free cash flow of $2.7 billion. The increase in operating and free cash flows from the third quarter of 2021 was primarily due to timing of production and billing cycles (primarily the F-35 program) impacting contract assets, the collection of receivables (primarily F-35) and deferral of cash payments for accounts payable (primarily Aeronautics).The company's capital deployment activities in the quarter ended Sept. 25, 2022 included the following:paying cash dividends of $739 million; andrepurchasing 3.4 million shares for $1.4 billion, of which $112 million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2022 upon settlement of certain repurchased shares.Multi-Year $14 Billion Share Repurchase Program and Dividend Rate IncreaseOn October 17, 2022, the company's board authorized the purchase of up to an additional $14.0 billion of Lockheed Martin common stock under its share repurchase program.

The remainder of the repurchase program authorization is expected to be utilized over a three-year period.

The stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be amended or terminated by the board of directors at any time. The amount of shares ultimately purchased and the timing of purchases are at the discretion of management and subject to compliance with applicable law and regulation.On Sept. 30, 2022, the company increased its quarterly dividend by $0.20 per share, to $3.00 per share, beginning with the dividend payment in the fourth quarter of 2022.Segment ResultsThe company operates in four business segments organized based on the nature of products and services offered: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Nano-Cap Stocks To Buy For 2022.Nano-cap stocks refer to companies that have a market cap of less than or around $50 million. These are volatile investments or trades and investors should always evaluate their risk tolerance before thinking about parking some cash in nano-caps.A study conducted by O’Shaughnessy Asset Management, a Connecticut-based money management firm, examined and compared the returns of small-caps and large-caps between 1964 and 2017. The researchers at OSAM found that small-cap stocks returned over 5.1% per year between 1964 and 2017 and outperformed large-cap stocks, which returned -11.0% per year over the same period.Nancy Prial, co-CEO of Massachusetts-based Essex Investment Management, appeared in an interview on CNBC where she made her bull case for small-cap stocks. Here are some comments from Nancy Prial:""We saw small-caps and interestingly even micro-caps outperform on a relative basis (in the third quarter of 2022), and small-cap growth and micro-cap growth were two of the only sectors that were actually up a little bit for the quarter. One of the other factors for small-caps here is not only are the stocks very attractively valued, selling at valuations of 10x or less, in aggregate, on next year's earnings and those earnings might be too high but that's still a great valuation. We have also seen, historically, that it's not really rising inflation so much as it is inflation that is high, leveling out, and starting to come down, which is the scenario that we think we are entering today. So that bodes very well for the outlook of this very neglected sector of the market (small-caps and micro-caps)...We are going to go into a market that rewards individual stocks, as opposed to macro themes, that will be even more tailwinds for the small-cap sector""Story continuesNano-cap stocks are not ideal for risk-averse investors.

The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward.Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.”9.

If you want to skip our industry introduction and jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, then take a look at 5 Best Space Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. The space industry is undoubtedly the hottest industry in public discourse these days, spurred by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation's (SpaceX) remarkable feat of landing first stage rocket boosters. This has generated significant public interest, since watching rockets landing is a novel experience that was out of reach just a decade ago.Naturally, these advancements, combined with those in computing and manufacturing, have also led to optimistic growth figures for the industry itself. Leading the charge with these reports is the investment bank Morgan Stanley, which estimates that the revenue generated by the global space industry can cross a whopping $1 trillion by 2040. In its report, the bank estimates that the cost to launch a satellite has dropped to $60 million and can potentially go even lower to sit at $5 million and that the bulk of the projected growth will come through satellite internet - particularly as launch costs drop just as the internet services themselves become profitable.Backing Morgan Stanley is Citi, who also believes that a drop in launch costs and the proliferation of satellite broadband will drive the space sector to generate the eye popping $1 trillion revenue estimate.Research firm Fortune Business Insights also focuses on the space industry, and it narrows down its focus on the launch services market. Right now, this segment in the U.S. is served by a handful of companies such as SpaceX, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin, with other firms currently developing and testing their rockets. The research firm believes that the launch services segment was worth $13 billion in 2021. The firm estimates the sector will grow to $14 billion by the end of this year, and from then to 2029, it will continue to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.25% to sit at an estimated $32 billion at the end of the forecast period.Story continuesAny mention of space would be incomplete without the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

Given this, you might be surprised to hear that U.S. defense spending as a share of GDP is at the lowest level in recorded history,9 at a mere 3.8%. In other words, U.S. military spending could double and not be out of line with historical norms. While we are not calling for a new Cold War, given the global instability we are witnessing, it is not unreasonable to expect defense spending to grow faster than GDP over the next decade.”The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Amazon.com, Inc.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Nano-Cap Stocks To Buy For 2022.Nano-cap stocks refer to companies that have a market cap of less than or around $50 million. These are volatile investments or trades and investors should always evaluate their risk tolerance before thinking about parking some cash in nano-caps.A study conducted by O’Shaughnessy Asset Management, a Connecticut-based money management firm, examined and compared the returns of small-caps and large-caps between 1964 and 2017. The researchers at OSAM found that small-cap stocks returned over 5.1% per year between 1964 and 2017 and outperformed large-cap stocks, which returned -11.0% per year over the same period.Nancy Prial, co-CEO of Massachusetts-based Essex Investment Management, appeared in an interview on CNBC where she made her bull case for small-cap stocks. Here are some comments from Nancy Prial:""We saw small-caps and interestingly even micro-caps outperform on a relative basis (in the third quarter of 2022), and small-cap growth and micro-cap growth were two of the only sectors that were actually up a little bit for the quarter. One of the other factors for small-caps here is not only are the stocks very attractively valued, selling at valuations of 10x or less, in aggregate, on next year's earnings and those earnings might be too high but that's still a great valuation. We have also seen, historically, that it's not really rising inflation so much as it is inflation that is high, leveling out, and starting to come down, which is the scenario that we think we are entering today. So that bodes very well for the outlook of this very neglected sector of the market (small-caps and micro-caps)...We are going to go into a market that rewards individual stocks, as opposed to macro themes, that will be even more tailwinds for the small-cap sector""Story continuesNano-cap stocks are not ideal for risk-averse investors. For investors with low risk tolerance, the best bet is to stick with investing in stable and mature businesses such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe screened for nano-cap stocks and identified stocks that had attractive valuations, strong fundamentals, and interesting growth catalysts.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK)Berkshire Hathaway's Stake Value: $3,018,027,000 Dividend Yield as of October 17: 3.67%The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) is an American investment banking holding company that provides related services to its consumers.

First Eagle Investment Management was one of the company's leading stakeholders in Q2.Ariel Investments mentioned The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Rising interest rates, after a surprisingly long period of low absolute rates and negative “real” rates, will create a headwind. While there has been much debate about the cause of these low rates, we believe the most important factor has been the $120 billion in monthly federal reserve open market bond purchases and the accumulation of an $8 trillion balance sheet. The former will end, and the latter will shrink. It is not just the Fed that has aggressively purchased bonds, bidding up prices and lowering yields. Bond traders and hedge fund managers have added to positions, confident that being on the same side as the Fed was the wise place to be. Now as the Fed is about to become a seller of bonds rather than a buyer, Wall Street’s “smart money” is likely to follow suit. Against this backdrop, fixed income securities and bond substitutes such as high dividend paying utilities and absolute return hedge funds are substantially overpriced and are not likely to produce attractive returns going forward.This expectation of a reversion to the mean for interest rates helped 2021 performance, though not as much as we had hoped. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury did indeed increase from +0.92% at the beginning of the year to +1.52% at year-end. An underreported story was the poor performance of bonds last year. The Barclays Aggregate Index declined -1.67% for the year ending December compared to a return of +28.71% for equities as measured by the S&amp;P 500. Interest rates have continued to climb in 2022 with the 10-year Treasury at +1.79% as we go to print. This move higher in rates has contributed to our good, early start to 2022. Smaller positions in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) also benefited from higher rates, principally with their ability to invest customer cash.”7.

Jordyn Harris was among them. The recent graduate of Delaware State University - one of the historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) - was there as not just an alum, but as a recent Medtronic recruit.For the first time, Medtronic was a presidential sponsor of the event and invested in discovering top Black talent there, specifically from HBCUs. Harris, an Associate Finance Analyst, was an intern at Medtronic and learned of the company through TMCF.""I had not heard of Medtronic,"" Harris said. ""But once I got into the program, they introduced us to medical devices and told us how the company helps patients ― that was fascinating to me because that's what I want to do with my career.""Just four months into her professional career, Harris assumed an ambassador role, sharing her Medtronic experience with fellow HBCU students as part of a larger company effort to increase diversity and invest in talent from underrepresented communities.Amplifying HBCUs as a source of exceptional talentTrent Agnew, Regional Program Manager from the company's Cranial &amp; Spinal Technologies Operating Unit, signed up to be a recruiter on behalf of Medtronic. He was consistently impressed by the readiness of the TMCF candidates. Agnew acknowledged that companies need to challenge the biases that exist when recruiting from HBCUs.""I attended the University of Illinois while working for another company in aerospace and there was one HBCU student from Howard University that was a part of the program,"" Agnew said. ""I noticed they weren't given as much time with orientation or called upon for certain things and it seemed unfair.""That treatment directly impacted Agnew, and he felt obligated to help change the perception of HBCUs - schools born out of a legacy of segregation in the United States that can and do graduate exceptional talent. He gave up his scholarship to Illinois and transferred to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical (A&amp;T) State University, the HBCU from which he graduated.Story continues""That fuel is still burning for me to call upon people to reevaluate those they may underestimate and undervalue,"" he said. ""And now that we recognize we are bringing in all-stars to this company, we also have to show them what success looks like, prepare them to be great ― in the end it's a win-win situation.""Partnership with TMCFTMCF supports over 300,00 students representing 47 HBCUs. It's a part of a larger effort the company has to promote equity and representation. Also the African Descent Network (ADN), a Medtronic employee resource group, supports this alliance even participating in the recruitment process at the event.To that end, the TMCF partnership aligns with the Medtronic commitment to zero barriers to opportunity. The company is working to remove barriers to equity in its workplace, industry, and communities they serve. One of the systemic barriers remains access to economic opportunities.

In 2018, the FDA approved the SelectSecure™ MRI SureScan® Model 3830 cardiac lead for His-Bundle pacing, another form of conduction system pacing. Now this cardiac lead is approved for pacing and sensing at the bundle of His or in the left bundle branch area as an alternative to apical pacing in the right ventricle in a single- or dual-chamber pacing system. These implanted pulse generator systems help patients who experience slow heart rates (bradycardia).This new approval adds to the Medtronic legacy of cardiac pacing innovative ""firsts,"" which include:The first leadless pacemaker (the Micra™ Transcatheter Pacing System, launched in 2016 and expanded to patients with AV block in 2020)The first pacemaker approved for use in MRIs (the Revo® MRI SureScan® pacing system launched in 2011), andThe first wearable pacemaker invented by Medtronic founder Earl Bakken in 1957.""Conduction system pacing is more like simulating natural activation and can yield positive outcomes for patients,"" said Pugazhendhi Vijayaraman, M.D., F.H.R.S., director of electrophysiology at Geisinger Heart Institute in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. ""This approval signals to physicians that the Model 3830 lead is safe and effective for patients for conduction system pacing, and it may encourage more physicians to learn the procedure.""Story continuesThe SelectSecure Model 3830 lead received approval for left bundle branch area pacing based on real-world evidence showing high procedural success rates at 92%, and low procedural complication rates at 2.5%.2Originally indicated in the U.S. for pacing and sensing in the atrium or right ventricle, the MR-conditional, steroid-eluting, bipolar SelectSecure Model 3830 lead has more than 20 years of proven performance and reliability. The expanded indication for left bundle branch area pacing was granted based on evidence from multiple sources spanning more than 20,000 treated patients.3  Now the SelectSecure Model 3830 lead is the first and only lead approved for conduction system pacing.""Physicians are telling us about their excitement for the future of pacemakers, which will rely on conduction system and leadless pacing,"" said Robert C. Kowal, M.D., Ph.D., general manager of Cardiac Pacing Therapies at Medtronic, who joined Medtronic in 2017 after more than 17 years in electrophysiology practice. ""Expanded labeling of this lead allows us to train physicians to successfully perform left bundle procedures, bringing the benefits of conduction system pacing to more patients.""1 Padala SK and Ellenbogen KA.

These candidates were discovered by Merck scientists as part of the TB Drug Accelerator (TBDA). The TBDA is a collaboration established among biopharmaceutical companies, research organizations and universities to accelerate the discovery and development of novel therapeutic candidates against TB. The initiative was established with support and leadership from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.""Tuberculosis is one of the world’s most significant infectious causes of human disease and death,"" said Dr. Emilio Emini, chief executive officer, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute. ""The development of novel therapies to simplify and more effectively treat TB has been a long-standing goal of scientific and medical research. The two novel compounds discovered by Merck scientists, and now licensed to the Gates MRI for further development and distribution, may represent potentially important constituents of future TB therapeutic regimens.""Under the agreement, Merck has granted the Gates MRI an exclusive global license for MK-7762 and MK-3854. In furtherance of its charitable purpose, Gates MRI will conduct non-clinical and clinical studies of these candidates to determine their potential for inclusion in new affordable combination treatment regimens for TB with the aim of shortening the duration of treatment irrespective of resistance to the currently available TB drugs.""At Merck we have a proud legacy of addressing some of the world’s most challenging infectious diseases,"" said Dr. Dean Y. Li, president, Merck Research Laboratories. ""With the expertise and capabilities of the Gates MRI, MK-7762 and MK-3854 are positioned for rigorous evaluation of their potential as components of novel TB treatment regimens.""Story continuesIn vitro and in vivo evaluation of MK-7762 and MK-3854 have shown that both candidates have potent antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the organism that causes tuberculosis, including some strains known to be resistant to current therapiesAbout TuberculosisTuberculosis is a major global cause of illness, disability, and is one of the leading causes of death from an infectious disease worldwide, responsible for an estimated 1.5 million deaths per year.The most commonly used drug regimen for the treatment of drug-sensitive TB requires patients to take multiple drugs for up to six months with routine clinical monitoring. Patients with drug-resistant forms of the infection can face longer and more complex treatment journeys, often with significant side effects that require increased monitoring. The need for drug-resistance testing prior to treatment initiation is an added challenge. A substantially shorter drug regimen for the treatment of both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant forms of TB could provide a significant benefit to both patients and health systems and may overcome the need for accompanying drug-resistance testing.About the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Medical Research InstituteThe Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute is a non-profit medical research organization dedicated to the development and effective use of novel biomedical interventions addressing substantial global health concerns, for which investment incentives are limited, including malaria, tuberculosis, enteric and diarrheal diseases, and diseases that impact maternal, newborn, and child health.

ENPH as the Bull of the Day and Nike, Inc. NKE asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on DCP Midstream LP DCP, The Williams Companies Inc WMB and MPLX LP MPLX.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Enphase Energy, Inc. is a solar energy company that operates in the inverter space, which has been able to sustain far more consistent growth than the broader solar industry. Enphase stock has skyrocketed over the last five years and it’s climbed to fresh highs in 2022 even as the market falls and growth stocks tumble.Enphase reports its third quarter results on October 25. ENPH’s most recent analyst estimates suggest it might be poised to post another huge quarter and provide upbeat guidance as the solar energy sector continues to gain momentum in the U.S. and beyond. Enphase BasicsEnphase is a solar energy firm that’s thrived as the one of largest sellers of microinverter-based solar and battery systems in the world. Inverters are vital high-tech components in the solar energy ecosystem because they convert the DC (direct current) power that solar PV (photovoltaic) panels produce into the AC (alternating current) power used in our homes and businesses.Enphase has hundreds of patents and patent filings covering various renewable energy technology for the U.S. and beyond. Enphase has thrived in a space alongside others such as SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) because its microinverters are designed to work one-for-one with each individual solar module to help generate more consistent power and for production to continue even if one module or panel fails.Meanwhile, string or central inverters often stop working if just one panel fails. Plus, microinverters help things run smoothly if one or more panels are obstructed by leaves, snow, clouds, or something else because the panels operate independently. Enphase has been perfecting its flagship microinverters since 2008 and they are designed to last up to 25 years to match the length of the panels themselves.Story continuesOverall, Enphase aims to connect solar generation, storage, and energy management into one intelligent platform. The company has gained traction within the home solar space, as well as for businesses and installers, working directly with the likes of SunPower, Panasonic, and others.Enphase has also expanded beyond microinverters into the battery storage segment that allows users to store power, which is crucial given the variability of the sun. And its namesake app aims to help homeowners and businesses effectively and efficiently manage their power usage, storage, and more.Growth OutlookRenewables accounted for 20% of the total U.S. electricity generation mix in 2021, to put the growing segment neck and neck with coal. This marks a stark contrast to 2010 when coal accounted for around 45% of electricity and renewables generated 10%—almost all from hydropower.The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects renewable’s share of the electricity mix will double by 2050, with a bulk of the growth expected to come from solar. Plus, the U.S. and many other governments around the world are spending money and offering tax incentives to spur growth in solar and other alternative energies.Enphase has ample runway as solar energy expands, with many envisioning a smart-home future where solar panels power homes, electric cars, and even allow consumers to sell electricity back to the grid. The company has relationships with many different solar panel companies and it’s growing its reach outside of the U.S. Enphase announced in early September that it boosted its distribution partnership with German firm BayWa r.e. AG.The solar industry is just starting to take off. Enphase’s revenue climbed from around $300 million in fiscal 2018 to $1.38 billion in FY21. Zacks estimates call for ENPH’s revenue to surge another 63% on top of last year’s 79% expansion to pull in $2.25 billion in 2022. Enphase is then projected to post another 33% sales growth to reach $3 billion in FY23.Enphase’s adjusted earnings are projected to climb 71% this year and an additional 26% next year to hit $5.16 per share. Plus, the company has continued to up its bottom-line guidance in the face of rising costs and a global economic slowdown that’s seen the earnings outlook for the S&amp;P 500 fade rather significantly.ENPH has topped our quarterly EPS estimates by an average of 25% in the trailing four quarters. And its Zacks Most Accurate estimates (most recent) have come in higher than the current consensus, especially for FY23. This bottom-line positivity is a great sign and highlights Enphase’s resilience and growth, and helps it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Other FundamentalsEnphase soared from around $3 per share five years ago all the way to $240 at the moment. This run includes a 900% surge in the past three years. ENPH stock is also up 40% in the trailing 12 months to blow away its Zacks Alt-Energy market’s 13% drop and its Solar industry’s 18% dip. ENPH has also managed to climb 32% in 2022 even as the market tumbles and growth stocks get crushed.The stock has fallen recently, which should help investors grab a better entry point. Enphase is down 25% since it hit new all-time highs in the middle of September to trade at around $242 per share. In terms of valuation, ENPH is not what anyone would call cheap, but that’s not the kind of stock it is right now.ENPH trades at 67X forward earnings vs. its Solar industry’s 52X. This is far better than the 120X it traded at this time last year and well off its highs. Wall Street is willing to pay up for its future growth and its 1.5 PEG ratio nearly matches its industry’s average and is directly in line with Tesla (TSLA). Enphase also sports a solid balance sheet, with $1.3 billion in cash and equivalents and $2.4 billion in total assets vs. $480 million in current liabilities and $1.9 in long-term debt, with it taking on more debt in recent years to fuel expansion.Bottom LineEnphase’s earnings outlook has climbed steadily higher and higher over the last several years. Wall Street remains rather bullish on the stock given its current standing in a red-hot industry and its ability to continue innovating in the solar market that has decades of expansion ahead.Bear of the Day:Nike, Inc. tumbled after it released its quarterly results on September 29 as it warned Wall Street that soaring inventory would eat away at its profit margins. The sportswear titan, like many others, is struggling to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to consumer demand amid ongoing supply chain bottlenecks.Nike’s post-earnings release drop is part of a much longer downturn that’s seen NKE shares sink 44% in the past 12 months alongside many other consumer discretionary stocks. Nike’s StoryNike remains one of the heavyweight champions of sportswear. The company has continued to adapt and create trends to help fend off improved challenges from Adidas, Lululemon (LULU), and many smaller digital-native brands.The iconic Swoosh is attached to many of the most popular sports, athletes, and cultural icons on the planet. This helps Nike stand out as one of the most valuable brands, alongside the likes of Coca-Cola and Apple.Nike continues to invest in its future through multiple shopping apps and its massive, wide-ranging digital marketplace. Nike is all-in on its own e-commerce and direct-to-consumer offerings, having cut ties with many retailers, all of which are great for margins and maintaining its brand cachet.That said, it’s facing a rough near-term outlook as it continues to find it difficult to navigate the rocky supply chain ecosystem and it’s getting crushed by the strong U.S. dollar. Plus, Nike is finding it somewhat of a challenge to adapt to rapidly changing shopping patterns as more consumers tighten their purse strings.Nike’s Q1 FY23 (recently-reported quarter) revenue popped by nearly 4% and 10% on a currency-neutral basis. The company direct-to-consumer segments continue to fuel sales growth. Despite its top-line expansion, the firm’s adjusted earnings tumbled 20% YoY as higher costs and surging inventory levels took a chunk out of its profits.Nike said that its inventories soared 44% to $9.7 billion in the latest quarter, “driven by volatility in transit times in North America, strategic decisions to buy inventory for future seasons earlier, and lower inventory levels due to last year's factory closures in Vietnam and Indonesia.”Bottom LineNike’s consensus earnings estimates have crumbled recently to help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). NKE’s Shoes and Retail Apparel industry is also in the bottom third of over 250 Zacks industries. And it lands “F” grades for Value and Momentum in our Style Scores system.Nike’s 1.4% dividend yield is nothing to write home about and it’s still not “cheap” in terms of forward earnings. And Nike is being forced to mark down its offerings heading into the vital holiday shopping season. Zacks estimates call for Nike’s adjusted FY23 earnings to slide 17% to $3.13 per share on 5% stronger sales. The company is then set to post 9% sales growth the following year and 27% higher earnings to climb above its FY22 levels.The long-term bullish case for Nike is somewhat firmly intact. Yet, investors might want to stay away from the stock for now given all of the economic uncertainty and inventory setbacks.Additional content:Bet on Midstream Stocks to Beat VolatilityStubbornly high inflation is keeping the broader equity market under pressure. Thus, to rein in inflation, which is at the 40-year high mark, the Federal Reserve is likely to opt for continued large interest-rate increases, thereby raising fears of recession and spurring market volatility. The energy sector is known for its volatile business scenario, and a slowdown in economic activities could significantly dent energy fuel demand.Companies belonging to the sector have been witnessing a choppy business environment since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020. However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Considering the backdrop, it would be wise for investors to bet on midstream stocks like DCP Midstream LP, The Williams Companies Inc and MPLX LP.Midstream Energy Players to the RescueAlthough the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks belonging to midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Thus, their business model is relatively low-risk, signifying considerably less exposure to both oil and gas price and volume risks.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three stocks belonging to the midstream energy space. While one stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), two carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.3 Stocks in the SpotlightDCP Midstream LP: DCP Midstream is a leading provider of midstream services, having a fully integrated and resilient business model. With 12 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage assets, the master limited partnership has 2.8 billion cubic feet of daily natural gas pipeline capacity. DCP Midstream, with Zacks Rank of 2, strongly focuses on strengthening its balance sheet with the foremost priority of reducing debt load.MPLX LP: MPLX has ownership and operating interests in midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets, thereby generating stable cashflows. With a strong focus on returning capital to unit holders, #1 Ranked MPLX announced a repurchase authorization for an incremental $1 billion of units.The Williams Companies Inc: The Williams Companies is well-poised to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy since it is engaged in transporting, storing, gathering and processing natural gas and natural gas liquids.With its pipeline networks spread across more than 30,000 miles, The Williams Companies connects premium basins in the United States to the key market. With a Zacks Rank of 2 at present, WMB’s assets can meet 30% of the nation’s consumption of natural gas, which is utilized for heating purposes and clean-energy generation.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Nano-Cap Stocks To Buy For 2022.Nano-cap stocks refer to companies that have a market cap of less than or around $50 million. These are volatile investments or trades and investors should always evaluate their risk tolerance before thinking about parking some cash in nano-caps.A study conducted by O’Shaughnessy Asset Management, a Connecticut-based money management firm, examined and compared the returns of small-caps and large-caps between 1964 and 2017. The researchers at OSAM found that small-cap stocks returned over 5.1% per year between 1964 and 2017 and outperformed large-cap stocks, which returned -11.0% per year over the same period.Nancy Prial, co-CEO of Massachusetts-based Essex Investment Management, appeared in an interview on CNBC where she made her bull case for small-cap stocks. Here are some comments from Nancy Prial:""We saw small-caps and interestingly even micro-caps outperform on a relative basis (in the third quarter of 2022), and small-cap growth and micro-cap growth were two of the only sectors that were actually up a little bit for the quarter. One of the other factors for small-caps here is not only are the stocks very attractively valued, selling at valuations of 10x or less, in aggregate, on next year's earnings and those earnings might be too high but that's still a great valuation. We have also seen, historically, that it's not really rising inflation so much as it is inflation that is high, leveling out, and starting to come down, which is the scenario that we think we are entering today. So that bodes very well for the outlook of this very neglected sector of the market (small-caps and micro-caps)...We are going to go into a market that rewards individual stocks, as opposed to macro themes, that will be even more tailwinds for the small-cap sector""Story continuesNano-cap stocks are not ideal for risk-averse investors. For investors with low risk tolerance, the best bet is to stick with investing in stable and mature businesses such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe screened for nano-cap stocks and identified stocks that had attractive valuations, strong fundamentals, and interesting growth catalysts.

President Joe Biden's administration has stepped up the crackdown against Russian airlines that followed the invasion of Ukraine, seeking to deny them access to spare parts, refueling and other services.The department said Ural was still advertising flights within Russia as well as international flights from Moscow,to Bishkek and Osh, Kyrgyzstan, and Kulyab, Tajikistan.To date, Commerce has issued 10 orders against Russia and Belarus’s biggest airlines, said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod.""Today’s action highlights the peril and consequences of attempting to circumvent our comprehensive export controls, and further impairs Russia’s aviation sector,"" Axelrod said, adding ""U.S. legal authorities are substantial, far-reaching, and have a meaningful impact on access to global commerce by parties found to be in violation of U.S. law.""Last month the department added three Iranian cargo planes serving Russia to a list of aircraft believed to violate U.S. export controls.The Commerce Department identified Boeing 747s operated by Mahan Air, Qeshm Fars Air and Iran Air transporting goods, to Russia in apparent violation of stringent U.S. export controls.The department has warned that any refueling, maintenance, repair, spare parts or services violate U.S. export controls and subject companies to U.S. enforcement actions.With the additions, there were 183 Boeing and Airbus aircraft on the list mostly operated by Russian airlines for apparent violations of U.S. export controls, the department said.Also last month, the department added 50 Russian entities to an economic blacklist, including the Moscow Aviation Institute and a number of aviation repair plants.

If you want to skip our industry introduction and jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, then take a look at 5 Best Space Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. The space industry is undoubtedly the hottest industry in public discourse these days, spurred by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation's (SpaceX) remarkable feat of landing first stage rocket boosters. This has generated significant public interest, since watching rockets landing is a novel experience that was out of reach just a decade ago.Naturally, these advancements, combined with those in computing and manufacturing, have also led to optimistic growth figures for the industry itself. Leading the charge with these reports is the investment bank Morgan Stanley, which estimates that the revenue generated by the global space industry can cross a whopping $1 trillion by 2040. In its report, the bank estimates that the cost to launch a satellite has dropped to $60 million and can potentially go even lower to sit at $5 million and that the bulk of the projected growth will come through satellite internet - particularly as launch costs drop just as the internet services themselves become profitable.Backing Morgan Stanley is Citi, who also believes that a drop in launch costs and the proliferation of satellite broadband will drive the space sector to generate the eye popping $1 trillion revenue estimate.Research firm Fortune Business Insights also focuses on the space industry, and it narrows down its focus on the launch services market. Right now, this segment in the U.S. is served by a handful of companies such as SpaceX, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin, with other firms currently developing and testing their rockets. The research firm believes that the launch services segment was worth $13 billion in 2021. The firm estimates the sector will grow to $14 billion by the end of this year, and from then to 2029, it will continue to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.25% to sit at an estimated $32 billion at the end of the forecast period.Story continuesAny mention of space would be incomplete without the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NASA is currently about to launch its Artemis 1 rocket to the Moon, and the development of this rocket involved NASA working with more than 1,100 suppliers across America. Some of these, as you'll find out below, are also part of this list, and the Artemis 1 launch is just the beginning, with the space agency hoping to eventually land humans on the Moon in partnership with SpaceX and another, to be decided, supplier.Therefore, it's worthwhile to take a serious look at the space industry, and some famous companies on our list are The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).10 Best Space Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by SpaceX on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe studied the space industry to narrow down which firms are operating in it and then consulted our hedge fund survey of 895 funds to determine which stocks are on their radar.10 Best Space Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds10.

What’s more, we believe that revenue growth may accelerate in the next few years. A lot of ink spilled every year about the “massive” U.S. defense budget7 that critics claim is “out of control”8. Given this, you might be surprised to hear that U.S. defense spending as a share of GDP is at the lowest level in recorded history,9 at a mere 3.8%. In other words, U.S. military spending could double and not be out of line with historical norms. While we are not calling for a new Cold War, given the global instability we are witnessing, it is not unreasonable to expect defense spending to grow faster than GDP over the next decade.”The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Amazon.com, Inc.

The BRU enhances pilot safety by allowing a mix of weapons and improves ground crew effectiveness through thoughtful operations and clearly visible indicators of critical release system elements.ProspectsThe United States, which is the largest exporter of military weaponry worldwide, is also strengthening military resources. This is quite evident from the fiscal 2023 budget proposal worth $773 billion put forward by the Biden administration for the Department of Defense, with $56.5 billion planned investments in combat aircraft. Impressively, the defense budget request reflects a 4.1% increase from the fiscal 2022 enacted amount.Such solid budgetary provisions should usher in contracts involving the production and upgrade of aircraft like the latest one. This in turn must benefit defense contractors like L3Harris, which designs and manufactures advanced EO/IR sensors and surveillance as well as targeting systems.

(NASDAQ: ILMN), a global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies, and GenoScreen, an innovative genomics company, today announced a partnership to accelerate progress to end tuberculosis (TB) worldwide. The partnership will expand capabilities for countries most impacted by tuberculosis to more effectively detect and combat multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). This alliance will enable global access to a package combining Illumina sequencing products and the GenoScreen Deeplex® Myc-TB assay, a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) based test for rapid and extensive detection of anti-TB drug resistance, to promptly inform treatment decision. This will help advance the World Health Organization's (WHO) strategy to end the global TB epidemic by 2035.Illumina today announced a partnership with GenoScreen to accelerate progress to end tuberculosis (TB) worldwide. The partnership will expand capabilities for countries most impacted by tuberculosis to more effectively detect and combat multidrug-resistant TB.""Through our partnership, we will enable lower-income countries to confront the pervasive threat of TB and work toward eliminating it,"" said Phil Febbo, chief medical officer of Illumina. ""The COVID-19 pandemic response led to expanded NGS capacity around the world, so now institutions have the platforms needed to support testing for TB drug resistance and improve survival for patients with TB, the leading infectious disease killer prior to COVID.""According to the WHO, TB is the first worldwide bacterial infectious killer, claiming over 1.5 million lives each year. And even though TB can be cured when appropriately treated, MDR-TB represents a global public health emergency. In 2019, an estimated 465,000 people developed TB with rifampicin resistance (RR) or MDR, yet only 40% of these cases were detected and enrolled on MDR-TB treatment. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, deaths from TB increased for the first time in a decade.""As a world specialist in TB genomic solutions, we envision this partnership with Illumina as an accelerator for the global deployment of our Deeplex Myc-TB assay, especially for countries with the highest needs,"" said André Tordeux, CEO of GenoScreen.Story continuesStandard culture-based testing methods currently incur turnaround times of up to two months, and conventional molecular assays are limited in identifying drug resistance. The combined use of the GenoScreen Deeplex Myc-TB assay and the Illumina NGS platforms allows much more rapid determination of extensive drug resistance profiles and TB strain types affecting patients.The Deeplex Myc-TB assay, developed and produced by GenoScreen since 2019, uses a culture-free approach to identify TB mycobacteria and more than 100 non-TB mycobacterial species, and to predict resistance to 15 antibiotics, in 24 to 48 hours—directly from primary respiratory samples. The Deeplex web application for automated analysis of the sequencing data enables clinicians to easily interpret the results and best define personalized treatments.""The Deeplex Myc-TB kit is the most comprehensive commercial molecular test for detection of anti-TB-drug resistance available to date,"" said Philip Supply, research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research. ""We are continually updating the technology to detect emerging resistance to the newest anti-TB drugs.""Implementing NGS testing will also benefit national TB programs around the world by providing critical surveillance data about resistance to different anti-TB drugs—important information for high-burden countries to guide TB control strategies.Use of forward-looking statementsThis release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The grant, worth over $300,000, includes cash and in-kind product.The grant will support CHRF's Building Scientists for Bangladesh program, which will introduce young women in under-resourced communities around the country to science and provide hands-on genomic training for university students and early career professionals.Bangladesh faces a multifaceted problem: Disease burden is high, and access and exposure to STEM education and the benefits and practice of science remain low. To complicate matters further, Bangladeshi universities are experiencing a significant decline in STEM enrollment, particularly among women. CHRF director Senjuti Saha, PhD, and her team hope to counteract this discouraging trend.""We believe that everyone across the world should have equal access to the practice and benefits of science and that if more young women completing high school can see themselves as scientists addressing problems in their communities, they will be encouraged to pursue STEM,"" says Saha, who is spearheading the education program. ""To make science more relatable to their everyday lives-not limited to theories they read about in textbooks-our researchers will take science to high schools across the country, especially in rural communities, and perform easy-to-do experiments to engage students and teachers.""The MissionCHRF has been working in Bangladesh since the 1980s because pediatric infections were causing far too many preventable deaths. The organization now has five laboratories and works with four hospitals in urban and rural communities, providing low-cost diagnostics, collaborating with local physicians, conducting research, and providing education.""We envision a Bangladesh where there are zero deaths and disabilities in children due to preventable diseases,"" Saha says. ""To achieve this, we must build a generation of young people who aspire to be scientists and leaders in their local communities.""Story continuesMany Bangladeshi students, even those enrolled in formal STEM programs, lack access to hands-on training, let alone to advanced technology like next-generation sequencing. This has a ripple effect throughout the country, reducing the number of STEM graduates who can support a much-needed diagnostics infrastructure.""We're committed to empowering the next generation of scientists,"" says Sharon Vidal, head of Corporate Social Responsibility at Illumina. ""We aim to expand access to genomics through STEM education and genomic literacy, so the benefits of genomics can reach everyone, regardless of geography, economic status, or gender.""Training Young ScientistsThe grant is supporting CHRF's multipronged approach to teaching young students about the life sciences and genomics. The organization is setting up six 2-day science camps at rural high schools, which they hope will reach 72 women. It's also creating a dedicated genomics training center that will offer two-week sessions, giving students unique opportunities to prepare sequencing libraries, load sequencers, perform bioinformatic analyses, and discuss data-sharing ethics. CHRF will train five students each month and award merit-based scholarships.The education program is already having an impact. Rupali, a high school student who donned a lab coat in one of CHRF's Dhaka facilities, is now considering a STEM career. Lubaba, who used a microscope to examine bacteria from her hand, hopes to be an astronaut.Both CHRF and Illumina want to inspire young Bangladeshi women to pursue STEM careers to improve their quality of life and build the intellectual foundation to fight infectious diseases. ""We want to show students the possibilities that are out there for them,"" says Saha. ""I believe that everyone across the world should have equal access to the practice and benefits of science. And for that, we need to build local capacity, starting with young students who have never met a scientist, or have never seen the scientific equipment that we take for granted.""To learn more about Illumina's commitment to Empowering Communities and Inspiring the Next Generation, click here.Illumina, Monday, October 17, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.illumina.com/company/about-us/corporate-social-responsibility.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/720624/Boosting-STEM-Education-in-Bangladesh]"
231,c44b5191-581c-3eef-bec9-4bc8cd237ead,PWR,2022-10-18,Should JPMorgan Diversified Return U.S. Equity ETF (JPUS) Be on Your Investing Radar?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-diversified-return-u-equity-102010830.html,1666088410,STORY,"['JPM', '^GSPC', 'PWR']","[If you're interested in broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market, look no further than the JPMorgan Diversified Return U.S. Equity ETF (JPUS), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 09/29/2015.The fund is sponsored by J.P. Morgan. It has amassed assets over $476.50 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendCompanies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Typically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments.CostsSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.18%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.37%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Consumer Staples sector--about 14.30% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Utilities round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Quanta Services Inc (PWR) accounts for about 0.48% of total assets, followed by Mckesson Corp Common (MCK) and General Mills Inc Common (GIS).The top 10 holdings account for about 4.53% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskJPUS seeks to match the performance of the Russell 1000 Diversified Factor Index before fees and expenses. The JP Morgan Diversified Factor US Equity Index utilizes a rules-based approach combining risk-weighted portfolio construction with multi-factor security screening based on value, quality and momentum factors.Story continuesThe ETF has lost about -15.13% so far this year and is down about -9.41% in the last one year (as of 10/18/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $85.50 and $106.83.The ETF has a beta of 0.95 and standard deviation of 24.10% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 367 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesJPMorgan Diversified Return U.S. Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, JPUS is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Southern Company SO, Valero Energy VLO and Fortinet FTNT.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Entering Q3 Earnings Season: Global Week AheadIn the Global Week Ahead, U.S. stock traders will enter the U.S. Q3 earnings season.China stock traders have seen a congress of China's ruling Communist Party kick off.FX traders are back on Japanese yen intervention watch.And across the remainder of global risk markets?According to Reuters, Britain’s government, for now, remains the key to whether a calmer mood can take a hold in markets unnerved by turmoil in the U.K. financial center. This has stoked wider worries about financial stability elsewhere.Next are Reuters’ five world market themes, reordered for equity traders:(1) Q3 U.S. S&amp;P 500 Earnings Season Now UnderwayThird-quarter U.S. earnings season heats up as companies report results in the throes of a difficult operating environment given a strengthening dollar and surging inflation.Earnings for S&amp;P 500 companies overall are expected to have climbed +4.1% from the year-earlier period, which would be the slowest growth since the fourth quarter of 2020.But more focus may be on how executives project the future; consensus analyst estimates are for a nearly +8% rise in profits next year, according to Refinitiv IBES.But many investors are dubious of that forecast as recession risks loom.A market slide has moderated stock valuations, but a downgrade in the earnings outlook could dampen equities' attractiveness.Upcoming earnings reports include results from Tesla, Netflix and Johnson &amp; Johnson.(2) Global Financial Market Stress UpdateOn top of UK turmoil, unease triggered by decades-high inflation, an energy shock and aggressive global rate hikes are putting markets through a stress test.Story continuesThe carnage in British gilts has exposed vulnerabilities in the pensions sector, shining a light on financial stability risks.So, the coming days will see increased focus on other possible hot spots that have gone under the radar of regulators.The IMF warns of ""disorderly asset repricings"" and ""financial market contagion.”Asset manager PIMCO reckons the U.K. is unlikely to be the only source of instability, adding that loan and private credit markets may also face stress.(3) Bank of England May Be Only the BeginningBarring a last-minute extension, from Monday the Bank of England (BoE) will no longer be the buyer of last resort of battered British bonds.The government's ""mini-Budget"" on Sept. 23rd sparked some of the biggest ever jumps in U.K. bond yields, spooked wider markets and triggered a crisis among pension funds needing to find bucket loads of cash.The BoE has been forced to intervene repeatedly to ensure financial stability, even as those measures contradict its task of fighting inflation by jacking up interest rates and selling some of the bonds it owns.The pensions industry has warned schemes aren't ready for bond-buying to end, while the government has suggested that if more volatility ensues the blame lies with the BoE.Growing expectations of a government u-turn on most of its unfunded tax cuts should end much of the pain.If it doesn't, buckle up for a messy Monday.(4) An FX Crisis Intervention Watch Is On, TooTraders are back on currency intervention watch as the dollar scales:Fresh 24-year peaks to the yen, andHeads back towards multi-year highs versus the Chinese yuan and Korean won.Japan's currency careened to the cusp of 147 per dollar on Wednesday, crashing through the trough at 145.89 that spurred the Bank of Japan to intervene last month to support the yen for the first time since 1998.South Korea also sold billions of dollars last quarter to prop up its currency, as the won plumbed a 13-year low just shy of 1,445 per dollar last month. Even so, it's not strayed far from there, nearing 1,440 this week.China has likely been deploying state banks to sell dollars and cushion the yuan's slide to ever-deeper 14-year lows, and traders are jittery over more aggressive steps to come.(5) Mainland China’s (Twice a Decade) Communist Party Congress UnderwayChina's twice-a-decade Communist party congress kicked off on Sunday, and the week-long, closed-door assembly is set to hand Xi Jinping an unprecedented third five-year term as supreme leader, securing his place as the country's most powerful ruler since Mao Zedong.It puts Xi in a position to pursue his vision for the ""rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,"" which includes the ""common prosperity"" policies that toppled behemoths including Alibaba and Evergrande.A desire to bring Taiwan under Beijing's control is also ramping up tensions with Washington.As for the economy, Xi has let that fall victim to other priorities: growth is set to miss a +5.5% target after repeated lockdowns under the zero-COVID program.The latest reading of gross domestic product is due Tuesday, after growth ground to a virtual halt in the second quarter.Hopes of pandemic controls relaxing at this congress could prove unfounded, considering how Beijing met a flare-up in cases just beforehand by barring many travelers in the recent Golden Week holiday from returning to the capital.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) StocksHere are three top large-cap picks, drawn from our latest #1 list.(1) The Southern Company: This is a $64 a share Electric Power Utility company, with a market cap of $65.3B.

According to labor statistics, millions lost jobs or were furloughed, while others had to switch occupations.(PRNewsfoto/Virginia Natural Gas)One industry that has remained strong is the energy industry. In 2021, new jobs in the U.S. energy sector grew 4% over 2020, outpacing the overall U.S. employment, which climbed 2.8% at the same time according to the United States Energy and Employment Report.As part of the local energy industry, Virginia Natural Gas has kept up with industry trends over the past two years and looks to increase positions at the energy company in 2022. In 2020, VNG hired 38 new employees, a 30% increase over 2019, and 25 new hires in 2021, all while dealing with an ongoing pandemic.As the industry continues to expand, the energy company hopes to add nearly 40 new hires to the payroll this year in positions that include utility workers, engineers, construction inspectors, asset protection, and project coordinators.""As a Top Workplace in Hampton Roads, Virginia Natural Gas is the perfect place to start a career in one of the fastest growing industries,"" said Robert Duvall, president of Virginia Natural Gas. ""We attract and retain highly skilled employees who remain with the company for sometimes up to 30 years, and in fact, we have an employee retiring soon with 50 years with the company. That speaks volumes to our culture which is built on mutual respect, inclusiveness, and safety, as well as keeping customers at the center of everything we do.""Take Kevin Stark, an engineer with VNG who has been with the company for more than 29 years. Stark began his career with VNG as an intern in the marketing department, and after graduating from Old Dominion University, rose through the ranks and into the engineering department.Taking his knowledge of roadway projects, he now handles city service projects. He may have taken an unconventional route to the engineering department since his bachelor's degree is in business administration, but he feels the company does a wonderful job mentoring employees into successful careers.Story continues""I enjoy the design side of my job,"" said Stark. ""It's a challenging job, solving day-to-day problems, but I work with a great team, and we keep the projects moving.""He also loves working for the energy company that put a lot of trust in him, he said, to promote him to his present position.""Virginia Natural Gas treats their employees great,"" he said. ""Not only do I get the chance to do something I love, but the people are great, as well as the pay and benefits. I can't see myself working any other place.""One of the newest engineers with the company, Sloan Parker, agrees with Stark, saying that the energy industry really is the best place to begin a career.Parker, a graduate of the University of Alabama in Huntsville, joined the VNG engineering department in May 2022 after graduating with a degree in mechanical engineering. The 25-year-old always knew he wanted to begin his career in some aspect of the energy industry.""I've always been interested in energy,"" said Parker. ""Even though I've only been here a few months, the work has been exciting as I'm learning about all the systems. Everyone is very helpful in answering questions and mentoring, plus the pay and benefits are great. I couldn't ask for anything better fresh out of college.""Parker joins the growing number of other recent college graduates entering the energy-industry workforce. Currently, the average age of U.S. utility workers is over 50, several years older than the national average in other careers. This means that 25% of the utility workforce will retire in the next five to ten years according to the U.S. Department of Energy, and not enough skilled workers will exist to fill the gap.Due to a ""graying"" of the energy industry workforce, VNG is proactively hiring in critically-manned positions, such as utility workers, to replace those workers who could retire soon, taking with them valuable institutional knowledge.""That could be problematic as many of our positions are largely dependent on OJT, or on-the-job training,"" said Michele Potter, Human Resources partner at VNG. ""That's why we are proactively hiring in those key entry-level roles. It's the perfect way to learn about the natural gas industry with the opportunity for growth and career advancement.""As the industry continues to expand, VNG will continue to offer career openings with opportunities for long-term career growth and stability in the energy industry. And as a Top Workplace in Hampton Roads, it's the perfect place to start a career while being well compensated with the potential for high earnings.""This all shows we are hiring and VNG is the best place to start a career and learn about the energy industry,"" added Potter. ""Our industry is booming, and VNG offers successful team members the opportunity to learn from some of the industry's best and be able to parlay that into a long and successful career.""To learn more about careers with Virginia Natural Gas, visit the careers page at https://www.virginianaturalgas.com/company/careers.html.About Virginia Natural Gas Virginia Natural Gas is one of four natural gas distribution companies of Southern Company Gas, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company (NYSE: SO).

236,9c753063-7072-361f-8d6f-15ba53885c5e,SO,2022-10-18,"How Good Is The Southern Company (NYSE:SO), When It Comes To ROE?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/good-southern-company-nyse-comes-130057383.html,1666011657,STORY,['SO'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine The Southern Company (NYSE:SO), by way of a worked example.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Southern How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Southern is:8.7% = US$2.9b ÷ US$33b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.09 in profit.Does Southern Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that Southern has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Electric Utilities industry (8.9%).roeThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Southern by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesSouthern's Debt And Its 8.7% ROESouthern clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.65. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Of course Southern may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

If you want to read about some more insurance stocks, go directly to 5 Best Insurance Stocks Under $70.The insurance sector has been one of the standout performers in a volatile marketplace in the United States over the past few months, demonstrating remarkable flexibility and resilience in overcoming a series of challenges, including the impact of the pandemic and the economic fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to a report by research firm Deloitte, this outperformance continues to be threatened by rising inflation, interest rates, loss costs, the looming threats of recession, climate change, and geopolitical upheaval. Some of the best insurance companies include Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), and MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET). Deloitte estimates that property-casualty price hikes were among the primary drivers pumping up premium volume and sending US consolidated surplus over the $1 trillion mark for the first time, even as inflation was driving loss costs even higher and faster in most markets. Per the research firm, as of May 12, average replacement costs were up 16.3% — nearly twice the Consumer Price Index rise. These numbers highlight the core contention that inflation is continuing to hamper non-life profitability even while boosting prices and top-line growth in the insurance industry. Research firm RSM claims that two key trends that investors should monitor in the space moving forward include artificial intelligence and machine learning. These, per RSM, can provide flexibility that allows insurers to innovate and transform faster. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the insurance sector and are trading at under $70 were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed.

CI.Insurance Giant Showing Immunity to This Year's Market VolatilityAs stocks continue to hover near the lows of the year, the question of whether we’ve hit a bottom for this bear market remains. A lot of damage has occurred, particularly in growth and technology stocks, as the Nasdaq has fallen over 33% from its November 2021 peak. Much has been discounted in the stock market in terms of the slowing growth that lies ahead.Will we encounter heavy selling on outsized volume, marking a capitulation meltdown as we’ve seen at previous troughs, or will it be more of a quiet bottom and slow, gliding trend back upward?The two big question marks are inflation and the Fed. As we’ve seen with September’s inflation readings for both PPI and CPI, higher prices continue to linger despite the Fed’s thwarting attempts. However, certain inflation components appear to have peaked, potentially paving the way for the Fed to take its foot off the gas pedal.Despite a very difficult year for most stocks, we’ve seen pockets of strength in several different sectors such as energy and insurance. These pockets have illustrated resilience, and rather than succumb to higher inflation, they’ve actually benefited from higher prices. We’re going to focus on the latter, which has held up very well this year.The Zacks Insurance – Multi Line is ranked in the top 31% out of approximately 250 industry groups. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.Let’s take a deeper look at a top-rated stock within this leading industry.Cigna Corp.Cigna provides insurance and related products and services in the United States. The company offers pharmacy, benefits management, care delivery, and intelligence solutions to health plans, employers, government organizations, and health care providers. CI distributes its products and services through insurance brokers and consultants, as well as directly to employers and other groups.Story continuesCI has exceeded earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 10.74% over that timeframe. The insurance giant most recently reported Q2 EPS back in August of $6.22/share, a 14.34% beat over the $5.44 consensus estimate. Shares have bucked the trend this year, rising nearly 30% and showing relatively little volatility.What the Zacks Model RevealsThe Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive earnings surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks #3 rank or better and a positive earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Cigna’s ESP presently sits at +0.07%. As a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, it appears CI is yet again primed for another positive earnings surprise when the company reports Q3 earnings on November 3rd.Make sure to put CI on your watchlist if you haven’t already done so.Disclaimer: The Zacks Income Investor Service currently has a position in Cigna.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Signature Bank (SBNY) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $5.45 a share, just one day from its upcoming earnings release on October 18, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $5.45 Most Accurate Estimate and the $5.42 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Signature Bank has an Earnings ESP of 0.57%.SBNY is part of a big group of Finance stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Cigna (CI) as well.Slated to report earnings on November 3, 2022, Cigna holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $5.70 a share 17 days from its next quarterly update.Cigna's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.07% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.70.Story continuesSBNY and CI's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

If you want to skip our industry introduction and jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, then take a look at 5 Best Space Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. The space industry is undoubtedly the hottest industry in public discourse these days, spurred by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation's (SpaceX) remarkable feat of landing first stage rocket boosters. This has generated significant public interest, since watching rockets landing is a novel experience that was out of reach just a decade ago.Naturally, these advancements, combined with those in computing and manufacturing, have also led to optimistic growth figures for the industry itself. Leading the charge with these reports is the investment bank Morgan Stanley, which estimates that the revenue generated by the global space industry can cross a whopping $1 trillion by 2040. In its report, the bank estimates that the cost to launch a satellite has dropped to $60 million and can potentially go even lower to sit at $5 million and that the bulk of the projected growth will come through satellite internet - particularly as launch costs drop just as the internet services themselves become profitable.Backing Morgan Stanley is Citi, who also believes that a drop in launch costs and the proliferation of satellite broadband will drive the space sector to generate the eye popping $1 trillion revenue estimate.Research firm Fortune Business Insights also focuses on the space industry, and it narrows down its focus on the launch services market. Right now, this segment in the U.S. is served by a handful of companies such as SpaceX, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin, with other firms currently developing and testing their rockets. The research firm believes that the launch services segment was worth $13 billion in 2021. The firm estimates the sector will grow to $14 billion by the end of this year, and from then to 2029, it will continue to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.25% to sit at an estimated $32 billion at the end of the forecast period.Story continuesAny mention of space would be incomplete without the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NASA is currently about to launch its Artemis 1 rocket to the Moon, and the development of this rocket involved NASA working with more than 1,100 suppliers across America. Some of these, as you'll find out below, are also part of this list, and the Artemis 1 launch is just the beginning, with the space agency hoping to eventually land humans on the Moon in partnership with SpaceX and another, to be decided, supplier.Therefore, it's worthwhile to take a serious look at the space industry, and some famous companies on our list are The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Amazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:TER) with strong pricing power for its products, since these chips are significantly smaller than their predecessors and as a result require more advanced equipment. 30 out of the 895 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey in Q2 2022 had held a stake in the company.Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER)'s largest investor is Panayotis Takis Sparaggis's Alkeon Capital Management which owns 2.9 million shares that are worth $264 million.Carillon Tower Advisors mentioned the company in its Q1 2022 investor letter, outlining that:Semiconductor test equipment and industrial robot producer Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER) fell after offering lower than expected revenue guidance due to fewer orders from its largest customer.

What’s more, we believe that revenue growth may accelerate in the next few years. A lot of ink spilled every year about the “massive” U.S. defense budget7 that critics claim is “out of control”8. Given this, you might be surprised to hear that U.S. defense spending as a share of GDP is at the lowest level in recorded history,9 at a mere 3.8%. In other words, U.S. military spending could double and not be out of line with historical norms. While we are not calling for a new Cold War, given the global instability we are witnessing, it is not unreasonable to expect defense spending to grow faster than GDP over the next decade.”The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Amazon.com, Inc.

(NYSE:NKE)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-nike-inc-110016910.html,1666090816,STORY,['NKE'],"[Does the October share price for NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for NIKE The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.94bUS$5.75bUS$6.89bUS$7.45bUS$8.50bUS$9.27bUS$9.91bUS$10.5bUS$10.9bUS$11.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x10Analyst x8Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.07%Est @ 6.94%Est @ 5.45%Est @ 4.41%Est @ 3.68% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$4.6kUS$5.0kUS$5.6kUS$5.7kUS$6.0kUS$6.1kUS$6.1kUS$6.0kUS$5.9kUS$5.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$57bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.0%) = US$225bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$225b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$113bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$170b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$90.0, the company appears about fair value at a 17% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NIKE as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.097. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

""And the Fed has sort of softened its tone a little bit over the past two months. They used to say that they could probably do this and achieve a softish [economic] landing.

Now, the retail giant’s Global Chief Technology Officer says crypto transactions will be right ""in the middle"" of its digital strategy moving forward.Speaking at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit (video above), Suresh Kumar said he envisions a future where digital assets will be used both in Walmart’s online stores and in the virtual world.“Crypto will become an important part of how customers transact,” Kumar said. “We want to make sure that we make it as friction free for customers …so that they are able to drive value out of it.”That vision reflects an increased emphasis on the development of emerging technologies at the Bentonville, Ark.-based retail giant since Kumar took the helm as the company’s first CTO back in 2019. In three years on the job, Kumar has built out a team of 20,000 workers globally, with another 5,000 tech workers and open tech hubs being established in Atlanta and Toronto.Speculation has swirled around Walmart’s crypto ambitions since the company filed seven separate trademark applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in December 2021, indicating a desire to sell virtual goods, including electronics, appliances, and personal care products. It also expressed an intent to offer users a virtual currency, including NFTs. Since then, the company has largely remained mum on how it plans to integrate crypto in the retailer’s larger footprint.Toronto , Canada - 23 June 2022; Suresh Kumar, CTO &amp; Chief Development Officer, Walmart, on Auto/Tech &amp; TalkRobot Stage during day three of Collision 2022 at Enercare Centre in Toronto, Canada. (Photo By Harry Murphy/Sportsfile for Collision via Getty Images)Kumar said he envisioned the use of digital assets to enable product discovery for customers at a time when shopping habits are changing rapidly. Specifically, he sees key use cases in the metaverse as well as live streams inside various social media apps.“I think a lot of the disruption is going to start happening in terms of different payment methods, and different payment options,” he said.Story continuesDespite the price volatility in crypto assets this year, major marketers have doubled down on their ambitions, in part, because it creates the potential for new revenue streams and allows brands to expand beyond their core customers. Pringles and Taco Bell are among a growing list of names that have issued and sold NFTs to appeal to younger customers, while Nike (NKE) partnered with Roblox (RBLX) to build out an online world called Nikeland, to sell virtual goods.NFTs are increasingly being used to create unique digital experiences, allowing brands to engage with customers who prefer to spend more time in virtual worlds or the metaverse, instead of physical stores, according to research by CB Insights.The global metaverse market alone is expected to reach nearly $400 billion in the next two years with virtual assets like NFTs and hardware driving the gains, according to Boston Consulting Group (BCG).Walmart has already integrated the use of blockchain technology at the core of crypto assets, with the development of a system that allows the retailer to track the origins of the produce and products they sell. The company is also exploring the technology’s use as a way to automate logistics transactions between suppliers and carriers.Kumar said the company is focusing its tech investments on three key areas, including in improving customer experience, and driving efficiencies in the supply chain.“We have got incredible computing power in the palm of our hands. We have mapped every single square inch of the planet. We have computers through deep learning that can recognize and understand natural language. And we have computers that can recognize objects,” Kumar said. “All of these things are coming together and they are the fuel for the next round of disruption that we are already starting to see. We are starting to see that in the way in which customers are finding, discovering, and getting inspired for new products.”Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

If you want to see some more undervalued stocks to buy,  go directly to 5 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.Undervalued stocks are defined as stocks that arguably trade for below what they are worth in terms of their fair value. Given each stock is different, there is no real metric to define which stocks are undervalued and which aren't. Forward Price to earnings ratios are not perfect as analyst estimates could be wrong and market valuations can change over time. Analyst price targets are also just a reflection of what analysts think and not what will actually happen.Nevertheless, the two metrics are still useful as information, and generally undervalued stocks are stocks of high quality companies that trade substantially below their historical valuations. Given that markets can be bearish at times, high quality stocks can be undervalued and their stock prices can go even lower for a long time.Due to the Federal Reserve having increased interest rates 5 times this year, the markets have fallen substantially in 2022. The S&amp;P 500 is down around 25% and the NASDAQ is down around 35%.As a result, the stocks of many high quality companies with quality earnings potential and strong competitive advantages have fallen substantially year to date.If the economy recovers in the long run, the stocks of those high quality companies could recover and rise too.When that happens, however, is uncertain and it looks like 2023 could be a year with potentially more rate hikes and an economic recession as well.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to hold a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors. If economic data fails to meet estimates or sentiment worsens, the market could decline further. In the long term, however, the earnings per share of the high quality companies will likely continue to grow and their stock prices could be higher if the market becomes more bullish.Story continues7 Stocks to Buy According to Eduardo Costa's Calixto Global InvestorsSource: pexelsMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now, we selected stocks that we think have the right mix of value, competitive advantages and scale.

Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55While Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has a P/E ratio of 24.29 and a forward P/E ratio of 25.74, the company has a durable income stream and is arguably undervalued. Analysts have an average target price of $96.71 per share on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Matrix Asset Advisors commented on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a premiere global coffee brand supported by over 32,600 stores across the world. The firm has a long history of beverage innovation and strong employee/barista relations with the firm paying above-market wages and benefits. Starbucks has a strong balance sheet and finances. The company generates steady and consistent cash flow, selling millions of cups of premium coffee every day. The company’s share price declined in part due to its large business in China which was largely shut down due to Covid restrictions and because of rising commodity and labor costs. We think the shares are attractively priced for a company that should grow 10% plus per year with a dividend yield of 2.6% at our average cost.9. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is down 23.5% year to date given the S&amp;P 500's decline of around 25% year to date. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)'s dividend yield of 2.92% as of October 16 also isn't as attractive given the Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. Nevertheless, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has high quality earnings that are likely pretty durable. In the long term, the stock could bounce back if the economy rebounds. Analysts have an average price target of $149.21 per share.8. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares have fallen substantially year to date with the stock down almost 50% in 2022. According to NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)'s first quarter earnings report, inventories are building and the company's gross margins are weaker. If there is a recession in 2023, the company could find it harder to maintain its growth. In the long term, however, demand for NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)'s products will likely return to normal and the company's stock price could potentially be higher. Analysts have an average price target of $113.04 per share.7. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a high quality conglomerate that is selling for just 15.6 times forward earnings estimates. Although the Federal Reserve rate hikes have made the Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s dividend yield of around 2.75% as of October 16 less attractive, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) still has long term upside. Demand for healthcare products will only grow as the world develops.83 hedge funds in our database owned shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) at the end of the second quarter, ranking it #7 on our list of 12 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.6. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 104JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a bank that has benefited from higher net interest income due to the rising interest rates. Nevertheless, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) also faces potential headwinds if the economy slows due to the rapid rise in those rates and its stock could fall further in the near term.In the long term, however, the bank has a lot of qualities that might make it undervalued.  Vltava Fund said the following about JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term. JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008. A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.In addition to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are undervalued stocks held by many hedge funds at the end of Q2 2022.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.Suggested articles:15 Most Valuable British CompaniesMost Valuable Companies in HistoryTop 10 High Dividend Stocks To Buy NowDisclosure: None. 12 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
253,3781ce01-e62b-36ef-971a-b360d990baaa,NKE,2022-10-18,Enphase Energy and Nike have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enphase-energy-nike-highlighted-zacks-151103522.html,1666019463,STORY,"['ENPH', 'NKE', 'WMB', '^GSPC', 'DCP', 'MPLX']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 17, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Enphase Energy, Inc. ENPH as the Bull of the Day and Nike, Inc. NKE asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on DCP Midstream LP DCP, The Williams Companies Inc WMB and MPLX LP MPLX.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Enphase Energy, Inc. is a solar energy company that operates in the inverter space, which has been able to sustain far more consistent growth than the broader solar industry. Enphase stock has skyrocketed over the last five years and it’s climbed to fresh highs in 2022 even as the market falls and growth stocks tumble.Enphase reports its third quarter results on October 25. ENPH’s most recent analyst estimates suggest it might be poised to post another huge quarter and provide upbeat guidance as the solar energy sector continues to gain momentum in the U.S. and beyond. Enphase BasicsEnphase is a solar energy firm that’s thrived as the one of largest sellers of microinverter-based solar and battery systems in the world. Inverters are vital high-tech components in the solar energy ecosystem because they convert the DC (direct current) power that solar PV (photovoltaic) panels produce into the AC (alternating current) power used in our homes and businesses.Enphase has hundreds of patents and patent filings covering various renewable energy technology for the U.S. and beyond. Enphase has thrived in a space alongside others such as SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) because its microinverters are designed to work one-for-one with each individual solar module to help generate more consistent power and for production to continue even if one module or panel fails.Meanwhile, string or central inverters often stop working if just one panel fails. Plus, microinverters help things run smoothly if one or more panels are obstructed by leaves, snow, clouds, or something else because the panels operate independently. Enphase has been perfecting its flagship microinverters since 2008 and they are designed to last up to 25 years to match the length of the panels themselves.Story continuesOverall, Enphase aims to connect solar generation, storage, and energy management into one intelligent platform. The company has gained traction within the home solar space, as well as for businesses and installers, working directly with the likes of SunPower, Panasonic, and others.Enphase has also expanded beyond microinverters into the battery storage segment that allows users to store power, which is crucial given the variability of the sun. And its namesake app aims to help homeowners and businesses effectively and efficiently manage their power usage, storage, and more.Growth OutlookRenewables accounted for 20% of the total U.S. electricity generation mix in 2021, to put the growing segment neck and neck with coal. This marks a stark contrast to 2010 when coal accounted for around 45% of electricity and renewables generated 10%—almost all from hydropower.The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects renewable’s share of the electricity mix will double by 2050, with a bulk of the growth expected to come from solar. Plus, the U.S. and many other governments around the world are spending money and offering tax incentives to spur growth in solar and other alternative energies.Enphase has ample runway as solar energy expands, with many envisioning a smart-home future where solar panels power homes, electric cars, and even allow consumers to sell electricity back to the grid. The company has relationships with many different solar panel companies and it’s growing its reach outside of the U.S. Enphase announced in early September that it boosted its distribution partnership with German firm BayWa r.e. AG.The solar industry is just starting to take off. Enphase’s revenue climbed from around $300 million in fiscal 2018 to $1.38 billion in FY21. Zacks estimates call for ENPH’s revenue to surge another 63% on top of last year’s 79% expansion to pull in $2.25 billion in 2022. Enphase is then projected to post another 33% sales growth to reach $3 billion in FY23.Enphase’s adjusted earnings are projected to climb 71% this year and an additional 26% next year to hit $5.16 per share. Plus, the company has continued to up its bottom-line guidance in the face of rising costs and a global economic slowdown that’s seen the earnings outlook for the S&amp;P 500 fade rather significantly.ENPH has topped our quarterly EPS estimates by an average of 25% in the trailing four quarters. And its Zacks Most Accurate estimates (most recent) have come in higher than the current consensus, especially for FY23. This bottom-line positivity is a great sign and highlights Enphase’s resilience and growth, and helps it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Other FundamentalsEnphase soared from around $3 per share five years ago all the way to $240 at the moment. This run includes a 900% surge in the past three years. ENPH stock is also up 40% in the trailing 12 months to blow away its Zacks Alt-Energy market’s 13% drop and its Solar industry’s 18% dip. ENPH has also managed to climb 32% in 2022 even as the market tumbles and growth stocks get crushed.The stock has fallen recently, which should help investors grab a better entry point. Enphase is down 25% since it hit new all-time highs in the middle of September to trade at around $242 per share. In terms of valuation, ENPH is not what anyone would call cheap, but that’s not the kind of stock it is right now.ENPH trades at 67X forward earnings vs. its Solar industry’s 52X. This is far better than the 120X it traded at this time last year and well off its highs. Wall Street is willing to pay up for its future growth and its 1.5 PEG ratio nearly matches its industry’s average and is directly in line with Tesla (TSLA). Enphase also sports a solid balance sheet, with $1.3 billion in cash and equivalents and $2.4 billion in total assets vs. $480 million in current liabilities and $1.9 in long-term debt, with it taking on more debt in recent years to fuel expansion.Bottom LineEnphase’s earnings outlook has climbed steadily higher and higher over the last several years. Wall Street remains rather bullish on the stock given its current standing in a red-hot industry and its ability to continue innovating in the solar market that has decades of expansion ahead.Bear of the Day:Nike, Inc. tumbled after it released its quarterly results on September 29 as it warned Wall Street that soaring inventory would eat away at its profit margins. The sportswear titan, like many others, is struggling to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to consumer demand amid ongoing supply chain bottlenecks.Nike’s post-earnings release drop is part of a much longer downturn that’s seen NKE shares sink 44% in the past 12 months alongside many other consumer discretionary stocks. Nike’s StoryNike remains one of the heavyweight champions of sportswear. The company has continued to adapt and create trends to help fend off improved challenges from Adidas, Lululemon (LULU), and many smaller digital-native brands.The iconic Swoosh is attached to many of the most popular sports, athletes, and cultural icons on the planet. This helps Nike stand out as one of the most valuable brands, alongside the likes of Coca-Cola and Apple.Nike continues to invest in its future through multiple shopping apps and its massive, wide-ranging digital marketplace. Nike is all-in on its own e-commerce and direct-to-consumer offerings, having cut ties with many retailers, all of which are great for margins and maintaining its brand cachet.That said, it’s facing a rough near-term outlook as it continues to find it difficult to navigate the rocky supply chain ecosystem and it’s getting crushed by the strong U.S. dollar. Plus, Nike is finding it somewhat of a challenge to adapt to rapidly changing shopping patterns as more consumers tighten their purse strings.Nike’s Q1 FY23 (recently-reported quarter) revenue popped by nearly 4% and 10% on a currency-neutral basis. The company direct-to-consumer segments continue to fuel sales growth. Despite its top-line expansion, the firm’s adjusted earnings tumbled 20% YoY as higher costs and surging inventory levels took a chunk out of its profits.Nike said that its inventories soared 44% to $9.7 billion in the latest quarter, “driven by volatility in transit times in North America, strategic decisions to buy inventory for future seasons earlier, and lower inventory levels due to last year's factory closures in Vietnam and Indonesia.”Bottom LineNike’s consensus earnings estimates have crumbled recently to help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). NKE’s Shoes and Retail Apparel industry is also in the bottom third of over 250 Zacks industries. And it lands “F” grades for Value and Momentum in our Style Scores system.Nike’s 1.4% dividend yield is nothing to write home about and it’s still not “cheap” in terms of forward earnings. And Nike is being forced to mark down its offerings heading into the vital holiday shopping season. Zacks estimates call for Nike’s adjusted FY23 earnings to slide 17% to $3.13 per share on 5% stronger sales. The company is then set to post 9% sales growth the following year and 27% higher earnings to climb above its FY22 levels.The long-term bullish case for Nike is somewhat firmly intact. Yet, investors might want to stay away from the stock for now given all of the economic uncertainty and inventory setbacks.Additional content:Bet on Midstream Stocks to Beat VolatilityStubbornly high inflation is keeping the broader equity market under pressure. Thus, to rein in inflation, which is at the 40-year high mark, the Federal Reserve is likely to opt for continued large interest-rate increases, thereby raising fears of recession and spurring market volatility. The energy sector is known for its volatile business scenario, and a slowdown in economic activities could significantly dent energy fuel demand.Companies belonging to the sector have been witnessing a choppy business environment since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020. However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Considering the backdrop, it would be wise for investors to bet on midstream stocks like DCP Midstream LP, The Williams Companies Inc and MPLX LP.Midstream Energy Players to the RescueAlthough the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks belonging to midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Thus, their business model is relatively low-risk, signifying considerably less exposure to both oil and gas price and volume risks.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three stocks belonging to the midstream energy space. While one stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), two carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.3 Stocks in the SpotlightDCP Midstream LP: DCP Midstream is a leading provider of midstream services, having a fully integrated and resilient business model. With 12 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage assets, the master limited partnership has 2.8 billion cubic feet of daily natural gas pipeline capacity. DCP Midstream, with Zacks Rank of 2, strongly focuses on strengthening its balance sheet with the foremost priority of reducing debt load.MPLX LP: MPLX has ownership and operating interests in midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets, thereby generating stable cashflows. With a strong focus on returning capital to unit holders, #1 Ranked MPLX announced a repurchase authorization for an incremental $1 billion of units.The Williams Companies Inc: The Williams Companies is well-poised to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy since it is engaged in transporting, storing, gathering and processing natural gas and natural gas liquids.With its pipeline networks spread across more than 30,000 miles, The Williams Companies connects premium basins in the United States to the key market. With a Zacks Rank of 2 at present, WMB’s assets can meet 30% of the nation’s consumption of natural gas, which is utilized for heating purposes and clean-energy generation.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021. Amazingly, they soared +40.3%, +48.2%, +67.6%, +94.4%, and +95.3%.

This week’s list includes JPMorgan JPM, Citigroup C, Wells Fargo WFC and Morgan Stanley MS.Can Bank Stocks Maintain the Recent Momentum?The market liked what it saw in the quarterly releases from JPMorgan, Citigroup and even Wells Fargo on an otherwise down day for the indexes. There was plenty to like in these results, with higher interest rates helping these big players expand their margins as demand for loans remained strong overall, despite slowing mortgage and auto originations.The Citigroup report was relatively ‘noisy’ and less impressive on traditional profitability metrics, but the market liked the progress made on management’s restructuring plan that has been in the works for some time now.The fact that the investment banking business was weak in Q3 was no surprise for the market. We knew that advisory fees will likely be about half of what they were in the year-earlier period, as persistent macroeconomic headwinds have been weighing on deal making.For JPMorgan, investment banking fees were down -47%, while the same segment at Morgan Stanley dropped a larger -55% from the year-earlier level. Citigroup suffered an even bigger decline in investment banking revenues, down -64% YoY.Morgan Stanley still remains an investment banking powerhouse, but it has deliberately been reducing its trading footprint, investing more in the relatively stable investment management business. Revenue in that business increased +3% from the year-earlier level and accounted for 47% of the total in Q3.Trading revenues rose +8% at JPMorgan, with fixed income up +22% and stocks down -11% from the same period last year. Trading revenues were up only +3% at Morgan Stanley. Unlike JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, trading revenues were down -7% at Citigroup, with the +1% gain in fixed income trading insufficient to offset the -25% decline in equities.Story continuesThe strength for these banking giants lay in traditional commercial banking, with expanded net interest margins and bigger loan portfolios resulting in very strong net interest earnings. JPMorgan’s loan portfolio was up +7% from the same period last year, even though demand for rate-sensitive auto and mortgage loans were significantly down. The same unit for Wells Fargo climbed an impressive +10% YoY.JPMorgan’s net interest margin of 2.08% in the September quarter compared to 1.8% in the preceding period. Net interest margins were up at Citigroup as well, with the sequential comparison at 2.31% vs. 2.24%. At Wells Fargo, net interest margin in Q3 came in at 2.83%, up from 2.39% in the preceding period.The big year-over-year decline in profitability for each of these companies is primarily a function of differences in how reserves or provision for loan losses behaved in the two periods. Tough comparisons in the investment banking businesses are the other contributing factor. At JPMorgan, Q3 earnings declined -16.7% from the same period last year on +10.4% higher revenues. Quarterly earnings were down -39.4% at Citigroup and up +2.5% at Wells Fargo. For Morgan Stanley, Q3 and revenues were down -28.4% and -12% from the year-earlier level, respectively.In terms of the Finance sector scorecard, we now have results from 22.6% of the sector’s total market cap in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total earnings for these companies are down -16.2% from the same period last year on +4.3% higher revenues, with 88.9% beating EPS estimates and 55.6% beating revenue estimates.Looking at the Finance sector as a whole, total Q3 earnings for the sector are expected to be down -8.5% on +3.2% higher revenues.For the Zacks Major Banks industry, which includes Citi and JPMorgan and accounts for roughly 40% of total Finance sector earnings, total Q3 earnings are on track to be down -14.3% from the same period last year on +5.8% higher revenues.The earnings declines expected in Q4 are essentially a replay of the forces that are shaping the Q3 numbers.The much bigger question of the long-term profitability outlook for the banking industry is a function of the negative impact that the coming economic downturn will have on the group’s credit quality.Skeptics of the banking industry argue that the group ends up giving away all the profits that it accumulated during the good times when the macro environment turns south. The Covid downturn was an anomaly in that respect, but there is some truth to the allegation.We will see how the economic picture unfolds in the coming quarters, but the credit quality metrics in the reported Q3 results do not point toward any imminent deterioration.Q3 Earnings Season ScorecardIncluding results from the aforementioned big banks on Friday, we now have Q3 results from 35 S&amp;P 500 members. We get into the heart of the reporting cycle this week, with results from more than 150 companies on deck, including results from 63 S&amp;P 500 members.This week’s line-up of reports is concentrated in the Finance sector, but we will get results from a host of bellwether operators in other spaces.For the 35 index members that have reported results already, total earnings are down -5.6% from the same period last year on +9.5% higher revenues, with 74.4% beating EPS estimates and 54.3% beating revenue estimates.As you can see here, companies are finding it hard to beat consensus estimates, even though estimates had significantly come down ahead of the start of this earnings season.The Earnings Big Picture2022 Q3 earnings are expected to be up +0.2% on +9% higher revenues.Don’t forget that it is the strong contribution from the Energy sector that is keeping the aggregate Q3 earnings growth in positive territory. Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the S&amp;P 500 index would be down -6.6% from the same period last year.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Breaking Down the Rough Start to Q3 Earnings Season  Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

Because there's been a lot of talk about that this is just the beginning. It's been worked on for years. COVID was sort of the big breakthrough event, for better and for worse, mostly for worse for the globe. But what now? There's talk about cancer vaccines, it used for other applications. So where is Pfizer on that?ALBERT BOURLA: I would say there are two horizons. One, it is applications. And the other is the technology itself. There's a lot of work that's happening to improve the technology. Now it's modified RNA. Could be self-amplifying RNA. It could be circular RNA. There are a lot of work happening right now that can have, let's say, way better even RNA vaccines.The other thing it is what applications. And I think the easiest hanging fruit, the lowest hanging fruit, will be other vaccines. So there is a lot of work right now that is happening. And we will know I think late this year, next year if those work. A second horizon will be in cancer. There is a lot of work that is happening right now.And then the third horizon, I think it is in gene editing. Gene editing is a very exciting technology that for people that they have a mistake from birth on their DNA and that causes a significant disease to them, you can go and correct this mistake. And for those people, it's really salvation. So I think we will see very exciting things from this technology.- And are you planning to do much of that work internally at Pfizer? There have been some questions on the part of analysts about how much progress you could make without a partner, as in beyond BioNTech in the case of the COVID vaccine. So talk to me about how that's working within Pfizer.ALBERT BOURLA: There are issues with intellectual property, who has the technology and the platforms. And there are issues with the combined work of two companies producing more. I think with BioNTech, we have a lot of collaborations. For example, we are about to enter in a zoster vaccine that, again, is happening with them. And we are working to expand even further. So there will be a lot of things that we're doing together with BioNTech. But they are doing a lot of things alone. And we are doing a lot of things alone.We are not shy from collaboration. Actually, we believe collaboration is a better way to bring science to the world today. For example, in gene editing, we are partnering with another biotech company that they have appropriate technology and we have all the expertise in scale to be able to produce solutions faster.]"

What's going to be the next source of revenue as you are going to see patents roll off for various products?ALBERT BOURLA: I think the pandemic from that aspect in all the bad things that brought to the world brought us something very important that gave to the Pfizer organization a belief that nothing is impossible. A belief in the culture that if we set our mind to a goal even if it is very big, we will make it. That's a big competitive advantage I think for the culture of this organization.Now going forward, as you said, we are starting losing patents of some of our existing products in year '26, '27, '28, '29. And there is a lot of discussion of how are we going to bridge that gap. So from '25 to '30 depends which the analyst that you rate could be from $17 to $20 billion of losses. We are having $25 billion that we are bringing through business development.COVID was nice in terms of revenue creation that COVID vaccines, but we are investing all of that. And we are investing in science that could bring products in 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. We committed to bring $25 billion of risk adjusted revenues by 2030.And we are already exceeded the 10. Now, our internal pipeline, it is what I think it is the biggest competitive advantage. And the business development will provide growth over the loss of exclusivity.We are losing to end you are gaining 25 so it's a small growth but the pipeline would be on top of it. Only next year, we are expecting to launch more than 10 products. Some were expecting to see the results right now.That's why I don't give a specific number. Five new vaccines, two oncology medicines, two immunoinflamation medicines. All of that next year, and '24 another round of new innovative vaccines.Story continues- And just by way of comparison, you said more than 10, what's a typical number of launches per year?- One or two.- Right. So you guys are busy?- Very busy. I think next year for Pfizer, it is a pivotal year. It is the year that we can prove to the world and to can prove to us that we can do multiple launches.I believe in the strength of our commercial organization and in the strength of our manufacturing organization, because it's very difficult for any company to pull together to 10 new medicines manufacturing wise, and sales force wise.- And those are, of course, are already in the pipeline at the company, that's not even to speak of acquisitions. You've made a couple of acquisitions this year. Most notably biohaven, which just closed recently. Global Blood Therapeutics, which was just announced.You have a lot of cash to make more, are you going to be making a lot more acquisitions, and I think we've talked about this in the past. Maybe not as large as legacy Pfizer, but maybe these sorts of mid-sized acquisitions, is that the path you see going forward?- I think so. This is what we have told our shareholders and this is what we believe that it is the best value creation. We want to acquire science at early stages that we can add value to it by bringing our manufacturing capabilities, our clinical development capabilities.All of these things that we demonstrated during the COVID period that we are able to do it, so that we can do way more with these medicines in our hands than if it was in the originator hands. We promised or we set a goal that we will make $25 billion of risk adjusted revenues we will acquire $25 billion of risk adjusted revenues. I feel very confident with what I see that there is enough substrate to do even more than that at prices and volume that requires a discipline.We are not going just to buy things, we are going to be very disciplined with acquisition. You mentioned some of them that are extremely well received by the market, the biohaven, the arena, and we will continue doing that.]"

You yourself had COVID a couple of times, I believe, in the August time frame. And I wonder if we're ever going to get to the point where vaccines can actually prevent COVID and its variants entirely. Is that the end goal? Is it a realistic goal?ALBERT BOURLA: First of all, I had COVID once in August, and one in October. And the second time was in the UK. I think that the goal is to bring vaccines so that they can last a year.I think that will simplify things, because I believe that people will not be that diligent to do the vaccinations as they are tired of making too many vaccines. And they want stability. But if we have a yearly vaccine, which is something that people are used to, like flu, for example, this is something that will take a significant amount of people to be able to get it.And yes, I think with the right vaccines, we can prevent from infections to hospitalisations to deaths and severe diseases. But of course, the vaccine has shown that death and hospitalization, the prevention is very high. When it comes to infections, so the bar is a little bit lower.- So it's more comparable to a flu than, say, a polio, for example, something that you're just trying to eradicate?ALBERT BOURLA: Or unfortunately, this virus is very nasty and makes a lot of variations, and [? insists. ?] So I think-- although, nobody knows. Most scientists are in agreement that for the years to come the virus will be around us. But we are lucky, because we have a vaccine that can adapt. As much as the virus [? stops, ?] the new technologies allow us, the vaccines, to very quickly follow, and have a vaccine that is very effective against the current virus.- And indeed you all have just introduced a booster that is targeted at one variant of that virus, Omicron specifically. Do you envision it where everyone, ideally, will get a booster every year, or will it just be recommended for certain portions of the population?ALBERT BOURLA: I think the health authorities will make those recommendations, while they see what is the severity of the strains that are available. But in many case, I do not expect that people will comply with these recommendations. If they did, maybe in the first months of the pandemic that people were really scared. So [INAUDIBLE] will be getting their way, so I see that the volumes of people that will be getting the vaccine will be less.]"

Many people in the US are there already with large maskless gatherings pretty much the norm at this point. Pfizer, of course, one of the companies that helped us get here. It is still relying on COVID for a lot of its revenue, but its CEO has his eye on what will drive the next phase of growth.And that CEO, of course, is Albert Broula. He is joining me now. It's great to see you again. Thank you so much for being here.ALBERT BROULA: Thank you for having me here.JULIE HYMAN: As I said, we are trying to move, of course, past COVID, but it's not quite done with us yet.

And yes, I think with the right vaccines, we can prevent from infections to hospitalisations to deaths and severe diseases. But of course, the vaccine has shown that death and hospitalization, the prevention is very high.

So I think-- although nobody knows, most scientists are in agreement that for the years to come, the virus will be around us. But we are lucky because we have a vaccine that can adapt. As much as the virus stops, the new technologies allows us the vaccines to very quickly follow and have a vaccine that's very effective against the current virus.JULIE HYMAN: And indeed, you all have just introduced a booster that is targeted at one variant of that virus, omicron specifically. Do you envision it where everyone ideally will get a booster every year, or will it just be recommended for certain portions of the population?ALBERT BROULA: I think the health authorities will make those recommendations while they see what is the severity of the strains that are available. But in any case, I do not expect that people will comply with these recommendations as they did maybe in the first months of the pandemic that people were really scared. So complacency will be getting the way. So I see that the volumes of people that will be getting the vaccine, it will be less.JULIE HYMAN: And that's what we've seen already, right? Uptake of boosters has been pretty low. I saw one figure recently-- 1 in 10 eligible people are getting them. You all have sold a number of boosters already to the US government, so that demand taken care of. You're forecasting $32 billion in vaccine sales for this year, $22 billion for Paxlovid, which is to treat it. What kind of visibility do you have beyond this year in terms of those sales?ALBERT BROULA: I have kind of visibility. I know orders that already have been signed, and I can calculate the demand. But '23 is going to be a year that likely will transition to many markets from governmental purchases to competition in the marketplace, which means that the vaccines and treatments going through the normal [INAUDIBLE]. I anticipate that will happen in the US in '23. Now, as with all our products, we will provide guidance to the best of our knowledge about how much we expect next year to make when we give guidance for 2023.JULIE HYMAN: Now, I saw an estimate today. The prices are going to go up as it goes more towards a normal type of marketplace. I saw an estimate from a company called Airfinity that the average price per dose is going to go to $37 next year from $18 last year. Does that seem in line with what you all are planning?ALBERT BROULA: I don't want to speak about price. But right now, in our contract with the US, the average price was $30. And that was divided between some that are less, some doses, multi-vials, and then all the way to 50 in the single vials. And likely, in the launch, we will have all the way to 50. The vaccines will be priced based on their cost-effectiveness. And the cost-effectiveness is multiple of what it is right now, the price, when we give to the in the pandemic.JULIE HYMAN: You, of course, came out with the vaccine in partnership with BioNTech, which is the German company. And you've split the revenue with them. How long is that partnership last? Will it last even as we get to different stages of the pandemic? Is it an indefinite partnership?ALBERT BROULA: Absolutely, it's an indefinite partnership in COVID. And we are both focusing on bringing new science into building new, most effective vaccines. Apparently, the one most important element is what we discussed before-- a vaccine that will last a year. And of course, combination with flu is another very important.JULIE HYMAN: Right. I wanted to ask you about that. You just started phase III trials of the combination COVID-flu vaccine. I think that was in mid-September.ALBERT BROULA: What we started, it is a combination study of a flu RNA vaccine. And we are about to start a combo as well.JULIE HYMAN: And what kind of timeline, then, do you look for for those products?ALBERT BROULA: I think the flu vaccine, likely based on events-- because an event-driven study, if there's a lot of flu-- will come into fruition sometime next year. We don't do bridging for that one. We are very confident that the vaccine will have real efficacy.So we went directly to study the efficacy of the vaccine. For regulatory purposes, you are required only to do studies. So that will take their time. And then the combination-- if you have already an approved COVID-19 and you have already submitted, about to be approved flu, the combination is very easy.JULIE HYMAN: Now, you mentioned more international expansion as well and different ways of marketing the vaccine. You have a partnership in South Africa with the semi-national company there, which is starting production of the vaccine now. But it sounds like that they may not actually bring it to market until next year. What can you tell us about where they are with that and whether that is a model for other partnerships we might see around the globe with Pfizer?ALBERT BROULA: First of all, this partner is a very trusted partner of us in South Africa. And we did this project because there was a lot of requests to feel good, better, the African countries that was in their continent, the production. But unfortunately, a few months after the first months, we had enough vaccines for all that were produced.But those countries did a very small a number of vaccinations. It was not the availability of the vaccine, but it was many other reasons, infrastructure of them, to be able to administer it, hesitancy from people. And I think this is the issue that we need all to address to make sure that those people will believe and they have a system that easily can vaccinate.JULIE HYMAN: Yes. That's been an issue obviously everywhere, not just there, of course. What can we look for next from the messenger RNA platform? Because there's been a lot of talk about that this is just the beginning. It's been worked on for years. COVID was the big breakthrough event, for better and for worse, mostly for worse for the globe. But what now? There's talk about cancer vaccines. It's used for other applications. So where is Pfizer on that?ALBERT BROULA: I would say there are two horizons. One, it is applications, and the other is the technology itself. There's a lot of work that's happening to improve the technology. Now it's modified RNA. Could be self-amplifying RNA. It could be circular RNA. There is a lot of work happening right now that can have, let's say, way better even RNA vaccines.The other thing, it is what applications. And I think the lowest-hanging fruit will be other vaccines. So there is a lot of work right now that is happening. And we will know, I think, later this year, next year, if those work. A second horizon will be in cancer. There is a lot of work that is happening right now.And then the third horizon, I think it is in gene editing. Gene editing is a very exciting technology that for people that they have a mistake from birth on their DNA, and that causes a significant disease to them, you can go and correct this mistake. And for those people, it's really salvation. So I think we will see very exciting things from this technology.JULIE HYMAN: And are you planning to do much of that work internally at Pfizer? There have been some questions on the part of analysts about how much progress you can make without a partner as in beyond BioNTech in the case of the COVID vaccine. So talk to me about how that's working within Pfizer.ALBERT BROULA: There are issues with intellectual property, who has the technology and the platforms, and there are issues with the combined work of two companies producing more. I think with BioNTech, we have a lot of collaboration. For example, we are about to enter in a zoster vaccine. That again is happening with them. And we are working to expand even further. So there will be a lot of things that we're doing together with BioNTech.But they are doing a lot of things alone, and we are doing a lot of things alone. We are not shy from collaborations. Actually, we believe collaboration is a better way to bring science to the world today. For example, in gene editing, we are partnering with another biotech company that have the proper technology. And we have all the expertise and scale to be able to produce solutions faster.JULIE HYMAN: Now, going into the pandemic, before the pandemic even began, there were a lot of questions about Pfizer facing patent cliff, et cetera, et cetera. Then the pandemic happened. You had recently come into the company and were trying to change it culturally and the way that Pfizer did business. The pandemic sort of did that, and you did that in concert. So where are you now in terms of that question of what is next for Pfizer, what's going to be the next source of revenue as you are going to see patents roll off for various products?ALBERT BROULA: I think the pandemic, from that aspect, the bad things that brought to the world, brought us something very important. It gave to the Pfizer organization a belief that nothing is impossible. And believe in the culture, that if we set our mind to a goal, even if it is very big, we will make it. That's a big competitive advantage, I think, for the culture of this organization.Now, going forward, as you said, we are starting to lose patents of some of our existing products-- the year '26, '27, '28, '29, so on. And there is a lot of discussion on how are we going to bridge that gap. So from '25 to '30, depends which the analyst that you rate. Could be from $17 to $20 billion of losses.We are having $25 billion that we are bringing through business development. COVID was nice in terms of revenue creation, COVID vaccines. But we are investing all of that. And we are investing in science that could bring products in '25, '26, '27, '28, '29. We're committed to bring $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues by 2030, and we already exceeded the $10 billion.Now, our internal pipeline, it is what I think is the biggest competitive advantage. And the business development will provide growth over the loss of exclusivity. We are losing $20 billion, we are gaining $25 billion, so it's a small growth. But the pipeline will be on top of it. Only next year, we are expecting to launch more than 10 products. Some, we're expecting to see the results right now. That's why I don't give a specific number. Five new vaccines, two oncology medicines, two inflammation medicines-- all of that next year. And '24, another round of new innovative vaccines.JULIE HYMAN: And just by way of comparison, you said more than 10. What's a typical number of launches per year?ALBERT BROULA: One or two.JULIE HYMAN: Right. So you guys are busy.ALBERT BROULA: Very busy. I think next year for Pfizer, it is a pivotal year. It is the year that we can prove to the world and we can prove to us that we can do multiple launches. I believe in the strength of our commercial organization and in the strength of our manufacturing organization, because it's very difficult for any company to pull together 2, 10 new medicines manufacturing-wise and revenue sales force-wise.JULIE HYMAN: And those, of course, are already in the pipeline at the company. That's not even to speak of acquisitions. You've made a couple of acquisitions this year, most notably Biohaven, which just closed recently, Global Blood Therapeutics, which was just announced. You have a lot of cash to make more. Are you going to be making a lot more acquisitions? And I think we've talked about this in the past-- maybe not as large as legacy Pfizer, but maybe these sorts of mid-sized acquisitions, is that the path you see going forward?ALBERT BROULA: I think so. This is what we have told our shareholders, and this is what we believe-- that it is the best value creation. We want to acquire science at early stages that we can add value to it by bringing our manufacturing capabilities, our clinical development capabilities, all of these things that we demonstrated during the COVID period that we are able to do it so that we can do way more with these medicines in our hands than if it was in the originator hands.We promised-- or we set a goal that we will make $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues, we will acquire $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues. I feel very confident with what I see that there is enough substrate to do even more than that at prices and value that requires a discipline. We are not going just to buy things. We are going to be very disciplined with acquisition. You mentioned some of them that are extremely well received by the market-- the Biohaven, the Arena. And we will continue doing that.JULIE HYMAN: Albert, good to see you. Thank you so much for coming in. Really appreciate it.ALBERT BROULA: Thank you very much.]"

272,246b5f3d-7bb5-31a4-bb28-3417e1ac3f7a,FOXA,2022-10-18,Fox (FOXA) and News Corp to Merge Under One Media Empire,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-foxa-news-corp-merge-164904832.html,1666025344,STORY,"['FOXA', 'NWSA']","[Fox Corporation’s FOXA founder Rupert Murdoch recently announced that the company is considering a merger with the media publishing company, News Corporation NWSA.Special board committees have been established by both companies and are at an initial stage of discussion to evaluate a possible deal and potential financial terms.A merger of the two companies would likely be structured as a stock deal. The exchange ratio reflecting the relative value of each company would be negotiated by the board committees of independent directors.What Does This Merger Bring to Fox?This merger of Fox Corporation and News Corporation would bring back high-profile business divisions under one roof after a split in 2013. Fox’s Fox News, Fox broadcast network, local TV stations and the Tubi streaming service would be combined with News Corp’s Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, as well as other assets including HarperCollins Publishers and news organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia.This would diversify and broaden the portfolio of Fox Corporation hence gaining traction with more customers and adding new sources of revenue to its top line.Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteThe publishing wing of Murdoch’s empire, News Corp has been performing better than expected. The Journal, part of its Dow Jones unit, enjoyed robust growth in its digital-subscription business over the past few years. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Digital-only subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products rose 9% year over year.The digital real-estate unit and book-publishing business also have propelled growth. Revenues in the Digital Real Estate Services segment increased 7% year over year to $443 million in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022.Fox’s driving engine has been Fox News with Fox News Channel once again closing August as the best-performing news brand for 18 consecutive months. Fox News usually attracts more prime-time audiences than its rivals and is competitive with the more widely distributed broadcast networks as well.Murdoch sees potential moneymaking and cost-saving opportunities in joining the two companies. The new company could look for ways to integrate its media properties. It could also explore ways to use the company’s assets for emerging business lines, such as sports betting, for which Fox has already laid a foundation by launching a sports-betting platform called Fox Bet along with the Stars Group in 2019.The merged companies could potentially save money by hiring one management team and maintaining one set of relationships with vendors, the people said.Story continuesThreats Attached to Proposed MergerHowever, this merger also brings some headwinds for Fox. Readers’ preference for accessing news online, mostly free, has made News Corporation’s print-advertising model increasingly redundant.Digital platforms, such as Meta Platform’s META Facebook, Twitter TWTR, Google and Amazon, which have higher mass penetration, audience data and targeting capabilities, may impact News Corporation’s share of the digital display advertising market.Meta benefits from increasing mobile ad revenues and growing adoption of stories by advertisers across Instagram. Twitter’s initiatives to add features and focus on effectively tackling abuse issues are helping it to expand the monetized user base, thereby driving ad revenues.A major portion of News Corporation’s total revenues is generated outside the United States. The ongoing foreign exchange fluctuation or the U.S. dollar gaining strength may hurt both the top and bottom lines of the company.Fox’s cable TV business also faces a serious threat from OTT platforms due to cord-cutting and changing consumer preferences. This does not bode well for Fox.In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Cable Network Programming EBITDA decreased 6.8% year over year to $628 million. The EBITDA margin contracted 520 bps to 43%.Fox, which currently has Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) declined 14.5% year to date against the Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector, which was down 41.7%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Lending will slow down quite a bit over the upcoming quarters, so a better reserve ratio would buttress them from a huge drop in demand.""Bank of NY Mellon Corp also benefited from higher rates, sending its shares up 5.64%.Overall, higher rates boosted interest incomes for lenders in the third quarter but turbulent markets choked off dealmaking and banks set aside more funds to brace for an economic slowdown.The S&amp;P 500 banks index was up 3.14%.

Headquartered in San Francisco, California, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) provides a digital technology platform. On October 13, 2022, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock closed at $84.04 per share. One-month return of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) was -10.60% and its shares lost 68.68% of their value over the last 52 weeks. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has a market capitalization of $97.191 billion.Here is what Wedgewood Partners specifically said about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) contributed positively to performance as the Company reported accelerating revenue growth and more concrete measures to drive long-term profitability. Revenue growth accelerated throughout the quarter as the Company is taking share in e-commerce while lapping the headwinds of the eBay rolling off. While eBay’s revenues represented higher-margin revenues, the Company should be able to drive better transaction margins as total payment volume growth reaccelerates. Part and parcel of this growth comes from PayPal’s investments to drive higher penetration into its 429 million active accounts. PayPal’s active accounts have grown by +50% since the onset of the pandemic so it makes sense for management to focus on driving higher transactions per account, thus better to monetize this historical windfall of users. The Company also authorized a $15 billion share repurchase program, which represents over 10% of shares outstanding. This is a good use of capital relative to the Company's historically depressed multiples.""Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.comStory continuesPayPal Holdings, Inc.

(PYPL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-inc-pypl-attracting-130001761.html,1666011601,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Paypal (PYPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned -14.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Paypal belongs, has lost 19.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Paypal is expected to post earnings of $0.95 per share, indicating a change of -14.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.93 points to a change of -14.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.73 indicates a change of +20.2% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Paypal is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PYPL _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Paypal, the consensus sales estimate of $6.84 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $27.91 billion and $31.54 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10% and +13%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $6.81 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.1%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $1.15 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.71%. The EPS surprise was +9.41%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

286,a02ad4d8-1543-3e59-b114-7210c0e32beb,IBM,2022-10-18,Gary Cohn on the CHIPS Act: ‘The private sector is bringing money to the situation’,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/gary-cohn-chips-act-private-195037564.html,1666036237,VIDEO,['IBM'],"[IBM Vice Chairman Gary Cohn discusses the midterm elections and the implications of the CHIPS Act on semiconductor supply chains at Yahoo Finance's All Markets Summit.Video Transcript- How much of it-- because we know when we look ahead to the midterms, we're 22 days away from midterms right now, Republicans largely running on the fact that high inflation, slowing economy, that's the fault of the Biden administration and Democrats. From your assessment, I guess, how much of it is a result of White House policy versus factors that are just simply out of their control?GARY COHN: You know, it's never ever one factor. You know, the one thing we learn is when we study the history, we'll know there wasn't one factor.You know, a lot of people will point to the huge increase in money supply. So as the Biden administration was sending out stimulus checks and they're putting money in the hands of consumers, we were increasing the money supply. As you increase the money supply, you've got dollars chasing goods. Those dollars are willing to chase the price of goods higher and higher.So we clearly saw some inflationary pressure from the consumer being in a very good position, having very-- very good balance sheets, unlevered. And by the way, we still see that today. If you see the bank earnings that we saw reported today, the banks were talking about the fact that they still have fairly high deposit rates, the consumers are still in relatively good shape, delinquency levels are low.So we still see the US consumer. This far into the COVID relief, we still see the US consumer with a very good balance sheet, still have the ability to spend. And that clearly is part of the cause of the inflation.We also had a situation where you could talk about the supply side. We had a change in energy policy, a fairly dramatic change in energy policy. Energy policy drove a lot of this. We've clearly had, you know, some unforeseen weather events around the world. And the food. We clearly have a war in Europe where we're having food disruption.Story continuesSo again, it's hard for me to put my finger on a single event, but all of these definitely have some blame and some huge contribution to why we're having this inflation.- Gary, one of the priorities of the Biden administration has been the chip sector, the passage of the $52 billion Chips Act. I knew you along with some of your colleagues from IBM made the trip down to DC to help that get over the finish line. From your perspective so far, how is the rollout going of this?GARY COHN: I think the rollout is going fine. I mean, I can't tell you it's going poorly or great. It's a slower rollout, but we knew that.You know, The Commerce Department right now has been empowered to go out and spend the money that was given to them by the government. But really the opportunity there was not just giving the Commerce Department money to spend. This was-- if this was going to be successful, it was going to be a huge public private partnership.And I think we've seen the public and the private get-- and the private sector get together. We've seen the private sector announce massive investment in chips in the United States. You've seen it in upstate New York, you've seen it in Columbus, Ohio. And these are not small-- small investments. We've seen multiple billions of dollars, tens, 20, 30, 40, 50 $60 billion investments by companies.IBM last week when the President was there announced a $20 billion commitment. You've seen Intel announce investments. We've seen multiple companies announce investments.So the government has done what they needed to do. They got leverage in the system. They talked about the importance of chips in the United States. They talked about being supportive of chips. We've got to get the permitting process sped up, but the private sector is bringing the money to the situation. Because ultimately, the money that the government is putting in is just a little tiny down payment on a big huge issue of being chip independent in this country.]"

288,501c1b00-d964-3427-849e-00d67a8f6d87,IBM,2022-10-18,Analysts Estimate IBM (IBM) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for (Revised),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-ibm-ibm-report-153703194.html,1666021023,STORY,['IBM'],"[The market expects IBM (IBM) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 19. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis technology and consulting company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.3% from the restated figure.Revenues are expected to be $13.75 billion, up 3.8% from the restated year-ago quarter figure.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.05% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for IBM?For IBM, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -6.39%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that IBM will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that IBM would post earnings of $2.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.31, delivering a surprise of +0.87%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.IBM doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.(We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake.

In the last reported quarter, the New York-based integrated systems provider beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. The company is expected to have recorded slightly higher aggregate revenues year over year despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and softness in traditional businesses.Factors at PlayDuring the third quarter, IBM reinforced its alliance with the United States Tennis Association (“USTA”) with a five-year renewal deal. The USTA and IBM iX, which is the experience design arm of IBM Consulting, have worked to develop and design the updated website and app, enabling fans across the world to mark their favorite players and curate their digital experience based on their own selections. Relevant and contextual content and insights have been redeveloped through the updated Scores, Schedule, Draws and Players sections.IBM also collaborated with VMware, Inc. to assist global clients and partners in improving mission-critical workloads alongside accelerating time-to-value in hybrid cloud environments. It will help clients improve their hybrid cloud journeys and business transformations by being Global Systems Integrator for VMware. As a result, clients running applications across more than one cloud will obtain assistance regarding security, management and reliability in such situations. These are likely to have driven the top-line growth in the Cloud &amp; Cognitive Software segment.The company further expanded its partner relationships in AI, network automation and security to help the telecommunications industry evolve as 5G and Edge Computing take center stage. During the quarter, IBM inked an agreement with Bharti Airtel for an undisclosed amount to deploy an edge computing platform in India. This is likely to extend the secured cloud services for business enterprises while improving their performance through reduced latency and higher data security features. These are likely to have driven incremental revenues in the Global Business Services segment.However, escalating expenses toward cloud platform development amid intense competition in the cloud space are likely to have eroded its margins. In addition, the company is likely to have recorded lower revenues in the Global Technology Services segment owing to challenging macroeconomic conditions and rising inflationary pressures.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the company stands at $13,749 million. Our revenue estimate for the quarter is pegged at $14,159 million. It generated restated revenues of $13,251 million in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $1.78 per share, indicating a decline from the restated tally of $1.84 in the year-earlier quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for IBM this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -6.39%, with the former pegged at $1.67 and the latter at $1.78.

However, as a wider set of economic and political issues took center stage this past year, new risks, and uncertainty loom over their plans.IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM)The study found that 2022 shopping budgets are up 8% over 2021—in line with Bain's economic forecast—and holiday travel budgets are up by almost half. However, factors including inflation and price increases have made economic concerns top of mind this holiday season. While 59% of consumers surveyed say they will be less concerned about COVID-19, two in three say they will be more concerned about the economy. 59% of respondents report worrying more about supply chain disruptions that could make holiday shopping harder or more expensive.""According to the survey results, in 2022, consumers are hoping to re-embrace holiday traditions they've had to alter for the past two years,"" said Karl Haller, Partner, Consumer Center of Competency Leader, IBM Consulting. ""They're starting their shopping and travel planning earlier but also want to hedge their bets with options like free returns or cancellations. To adapt to these changes in consumer behavior, retailers will need better visibility and traceability across product inventory, fulfillment, and returns. AI can help them understand, prioritize, and resolve critical issues in real time.""Other noteworthy findings include:Uncertainty around inflation, gas prices, and supply chain is driving consumer plansAs COVID-19 pandemic concerns abate for many consumers, worries are shifting towards uncertain economic and supply chain conditions this holiday season.Story continues-  Nearly half of consumers surveyed will spend less if inflation continues to drive price increases. If they're forced to cut their holiday shopping budget, over 60% will cut the non-essential categories like apparel, footwear, jewelry, and accessories.-  If goods are not available due to supply chain issues, 41% of respondents say they will spend less – but 30% will spend more if they can find substitutions easily.-  If gas prices go down, 35% of consumers surveyed will do more in-store shopping.Consumers are making travel and shopping plans earlier but they want to keep their options openContinuing the shift away from the traditional Black Friday start of the shopping season, 58% of consumers surveyed plan to start holiday shopping before November, compared to 44% last year. Almost two in three plan to pre-order this holiday season to get their products on-time with guaranteed prices.At the same time, consumers want to keep their options open. Nearly seven in ten respondents surveyed will opt for brands or retailers that offer free cancellations, order changes, and returns, as well as a COVID-19-safe environment this holiday season. The study findings seem to indicate these perks are often worth the price due to the continued worries around supply chain and product availability this season.Travel is also an area where consumers are looking to get back to normal, while still mitigating any risk associated with potential price changes due to inflation and fluctuating gas prices. The study found that average travel demand will go up by 9% during the holiday season and 78% of consumers surveyed are planning to purchase their airfare before October (61%) or in October (17%).Sustainability remains top-of-mind for majority of respondents despite economic hardshipsConsistent with last year's report, sustainability remains top-of-mind for consumers surveyed globally. ""As more consumers align their purchases with their values, retailers and brands that can provide more environmentally-friendly options could potentially earn a greater share of holiday spend,"" said Haller.Three fourths (73%) of respondents said they are considering sustainability when shopping for the holidays. Twenty-nine percent of consumers surveyed will bundle multiple orders to help reduce carbon emissions, while 38% will avoid single-use plastics, and two in five will choose to shop nearby (42%), and buy products that are branded as being environmentally sustainable or socially responsible (41%). Notably, respondents surveyed are willing to pay an average premium of 41% for sustainable products, 34% for sustainable air travel, and 37% for sustainable lodging this holiday season.IBV Study MethodologyTo better understand consumer perspectives, as well as their plans to shop and travel this holiday season, the IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) surveyed more than 12,000 adults across nine countries (Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom, United States) in August 2022.The full study is available at: https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/2022-holiday-shopping-travelAbout the IBM Institute for Business Value For two decades, the IBM Institute for Business Value has served as the thought leadership think tank for IBM.

Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.86%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.24%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the refiner had gained 8.83% over the past month. This has outpaced the Oils-Energy sector's loss of 4.88% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 8.99% in that time.Marathon Petroleum will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be November 1, 2022. On that day, Marathon Petroleum is projected to report earnings of $6.96 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 853.42%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $37.15 billion, up 13.92% from the year-ago period.MPC's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $22.47 per share and revenue of $166.38 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +817.14% and +37.59%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Marathon Petroleum. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

Instead, it boasts twin electric motors producing 600 horsepower and a 111-kilowatt-hour battery pack shared with GM's Hummer EV.It is also one of the strangest-looking vehicles ever created by GM. The company's design boss Mike Simcoe refers to the Celestiq — a long, four-door fastback that is not quite a sedan — as a “spaceship,” adding, “there will be nothing like it on the road.”The hand-built Celestiq, which goes into production late next year, has two things in common with the Sixteen: Customers can spec out the car in intricate detail, and it will be assembled in extremely low numbers.GM built just over 4,000 Sixteens in Detroit during the Great Depression. The company says a new dedicated facility at its Warren, Michigan technical center can build two Celestiqs a day — about 500-600 vehicles a year.The Sixteen could be ordered in 1930 in several body styles, including roadster, coupe, sedan and limousine. The largest of these measured 6.1 meters long — about 20 feet. The Celestiq is a tad smaller, but not much: 5.5 meters, or 18 feet.The late historian Beverly Kimes noted that the 1930 Cadillac Sixteen Town Brougham was priced at just over $9,000, or roughly $163,500 in today's money.That is about half the price of a basic Celestiq, which will start “in the low 300s,” according to Cadillac vice president Rory Harvey, who declined to say how high that sticker might go with all the bells and whistles added.(Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Josie Kao)]"

299,ccba52c7-f464-30c3-b808-1b94c43559b0,GM,2022-10-18,GM CEO Mary Barra speaks at the 2022 Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/gm-ceo-mary-barra-speaks-133642814.html,1666013802,VIDEO,['GM'],"[Mary Barra General Motors Chair &amp; CEO speaks with Yahoo Finance Editor-In-Chief Andy Serwer at the 2022 Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: New Challenges, New Opportunities.Video TranscriptANDY SERWER: There's no better place to start than with GM CEO Mary Barra, a business leader who arguably more than any other is at the center of the many new challenges and opportunities in our world today. I met her a few days ago in Detroit at GM's famed Design Center and started by asking her about a brand new business, GM Energy.[MUSIC PLAYING]MARY BARRA: One of the things we want people to understand is not only is an electric vehicle your mode of transportation, how you get from point A to point B, but it can also be a power source. And I think that's going to be very important as we look and really strengthen the grid in whatever country we're doing work. And in addition, we can leverage the technology we have, the battery technology, to provide clean energy, energy storage, and also supplement the grid. So we're really excited about the business opportunity based on the LTM technology that we have.ANDY SERWER: How big a business can this be for your company, and where do you see it in five years, for instance?MARY BARRA: We haven't put those numbers out yet, but we see it being a significant growth opportunity for the company. So when you look at not only are we moving into electric vehicles that we think in the near to medium term will be growth because where we have opportunity to perform better is on the coast, that's where EV adoption is happening more quickly. Then you look at BrightDrop and we don't really have a light commercial vehicle business, so getting into the electric light commercial vehicle business is growth for us as is GM energy. when you look at it being another reason people buy an electric vehicle but also what we can do beyond the vehicle from an energy perspective.ANDY SERWER: And you have all manner of electric vehicles out there coming. What GM vehicles are on the road right now that are EVs, and which ones are coming, say, in Q1 of next year?Story continuesMARY BARRA: Sure, well, right now we have the Bolt EV, the Bolt EUV, which I'm driving. We also have the GMC Hummer EV, and we have the Cadillac LYRIQ that is just starting production. So that's all out right now. I do have to say we've had such strong demand for the Hummer and the LYRIQ that we're into next year from an order perspective, in some cases beyond. But then in first quarter, we'll launch the Silverado EV, and then if you go a little bit longer into second and third quarter, we'll have both the Chevrolet Blazer EV as well as the Chevrolet Equinox EV. So when we get to this point next year, we have a lot of models in the heart of the market, the largest segments in the market.ANDY SERWER: We're here in GM's Design Center. Talk to us about what this means to GM history and also what it means for the future of the company.MARY BARRA: Well, this is literally the building and the room where we review new vehicles and look at them from a design perspective, clay models or we have a lot of technology in this room from a virtual perspective as well. So this is where it happens. This is where decisions are made, and it's a vital part of the design process because no matter how much technology you have on a vehicle, it has to start with being beautiful. And I'm so excited about the new designs we have coming out.ANDY SERWER: I want to ask you about the economy, and you have, obviously, a unique perspective because you can talk to your dealers, and they can talk to you about consumer demand. Where is the economy right now based on where you sit, and what do you see going forward?MARY BARRA: Well, we are starting to see some changes from a used car pricing perspective. and we're watching and we're seeing, right now, it's very hard to know exactly what's happening in the market because we have been supply constrained for so long. So we know there's pent up demand, but also there's challenges in the logistics and moving vehicles once they're built. Even we still are dealing with semiconductor shortages, but then when we get to that point, getting vehicles moved to get to the dealers has been challenging as well.So it's really an interesting time. We're watching almost on a daily basis to see what's happening. We still see strong demand for many of our products, especially our full-sized sized trucks and our mid-sized crossovers, but again, we're watching all the signs. I mean, I think we're listening to what everyone else is saying around the globe, and so we're preparing next year for a year that will look more like we have a little-- it will actually be more demand but a little less demand than what we would think because we're going to be conservative, make sure we set our cost structure up that way.So then if things turn out better, we're well positioned. But most importantly, because we have so many important EV launches next year as well as cruise growth, we want to make sure that we can fund our future regardless of where the economy is-- downturn, recession all those words that are being used. We want to be prepared regardless of the environment.ANDY SERWER: And you're not seeing higher rates impacting consumer demand.MARY BARRA: We haven't so far, but again, it's a very unique situation because we've been supply constrained for so long. And so that's what we're watching because we know a vehicle is a very important purchase that people make, and that they may make different decisions depending on how they feel about their own personal economic situation.ANDY SERWER: And you mentioned the chip shortage and supply chains a couple of times now, and how is that being mitigated? Is it improving, and then what about some other supply issues you might have with batteries and the inputs that go in there?MARY BARRA: Sure. Well, from an overall supply chain, we do see the semiconductor supply improving quarter by quarter, but we still see more volatility than we're used to. I think one of the reasons for that is the supply chain has been stretched so thin. So we're looking for improvement as we go forward. But it's still there, and it's still an issue.As I said, logistics is-- getting the vehicles moved is another challenge, but then when you look at other like supplying for EVs, one of the things that's going to be key to unlocking more Hummers, more LYRIQs and all of our vehicles is the battery plants. And we're actually running the battery plant in Ohio now, and as that is able to ramp up, more cells will provide our ability to provide more electric vehicles.I would also say GM, we actually have signed agreements for the production that we need between now and 2025 to get to our million units in 2025 in the United States and more than that in China. So we're on track to do that, and we have that supply chain secured.ANDY SERWER: You just mentioned China. I want to follow up there. You've had such success in that country with Buick. There are a lot of new EVs there. What does the future of that marketplace look for you?MARY BARRA: Well, we're still-- we still think there's tremendous opportunity there. As you mentioned, the Buick brand is very strong as is Cadillac, and we also have Chevrolet there. But we also have a joint ventureship with Wuling that allows us to sell not only the Baojun brand but some other vehicles. Like the Hongguang mini EV has been one of the highest selling vehicles this year from a Chinese perspective, from-- for EVs. So we think there's opportunity. We're definitely seeing the landscape change. We're seeing more competition from domestic suppliers, but we think especially in luxury and with Buick, the strength of those brands we think is going to remain strong.ANDY SERWER: I want to drill down on a couple of domestic brands, Equinox, for instance, which sounds like a car for everybody, right, with a price point. It's an EV coming out in a year or so. Talk to us about that one.MARY BARRA: That comes out in the second part of next year, and what's so important about the Chevrolet Equinox EV is that it's in the biggest segment globally, the biggest segment from a North America perspective as well, and it's about affordability. So if you're around $30,000, you really get into the sweet spot of the market. And we've been really excited because we revealed the vehicle, and people-- there's been such a strong positive response to the vehicle.And when people get in and actually get to drive it and see how great driving an EV is and then they see the technology on that vehicle-- it's got a 17.7 inch screen. It has safety features and safety technology. People are going to realize they're getting a great vehicle and able to move into EVs with confidence.ANDY SERWER: On the high end, the CELESTIQ, am I saying that right?MARY BARRA: Yes.ANDY SERWER: It's sort of a customized Cadillac, right? Talk to us about that one.MARY BARRA: Well, so it's a bespoke Cadillac. It really, if you look at what Cadillac means for so many people, people still use the term Cadillac for standard of the world . And we really believe with all the work we've done not only in our internal combustion with the Escalade V and the Blackwing series and the attention to design, as we move to our all-electric future with Cadillac CELESTIQ is really-- is going to be the pinnacle from that perspective.It will be hand-built on this site, and the customers that will be able to customize the vehicle from interior exterior, so we're really excited. The response for people that we've really revealed the vehicle to has been very, very positive. And so this really is one of the final steps in regaining that standard of the world for Cadillac, and the response has been tremendous across all of our Cadillac products.ANDY SERWER: Mary, GM's stock has lagged a bit over the past year or so, and I'm wondering what you would say to shareholders. Why should they buy the stock, hold the stock, own the stock going forward?MARY BARRA: Well, you know, I think there's been so much attention earlier this year was how many EVs are you selling today? And we were in a difficult situation because we did the right thing for the consumer and for safety. And when we found there was a manufacturing defect in the Bolt cell, we stopped producing so we could do the replacement cells for our customers. As we've moved through the year, we were able to start building the Bolt again, and we've actually had two record months in a row of sales of the Bolt EV and EUV.So I think that impacted the early view, but what I would say to shareholders is take a little bit longer view because this isn't a one-year race. We are at the very early stages of driving EV adoption. And when you look at the vehicles that we have coming out next year with the Silverado EV, the Equinox, and the Blazer, again, those are big segments of the US industry. And to have really credible products in that I think is going to allow us to grow, and that's why we're confident that we're going to hit our ability to produce a million units and see strong demand for our vehicles by the time we're at 2025.ANDY SERWER: Let me ask you about the workforce here at GM. Everyone's back at work. How's that going? Are you retraining people to work in facilities that manufacture EVs? Talk to us just generally about that.MARY BARRA: Sure. Well, one of the things I want to give a big shout out to is our manufacturing, our warehouse, our design, our R&amp;D. They have been working all through. I mean, they were off for a very short period of time at the early days of the pandemic, but they have been at work all along. And so without them, we don't produce vehicles. We don't design vehicles. So first of all, very happy and proud of that team.We are in the process of having people come back to work now. We're going to be communicating more because we've recognized to maintain our culture and to get the interaction, we've hired probably about 10,000 people into the company during the pandemic. And so having those people actually come to work, and I call it it's that five minutes before the meeting starts and the five minutes after it ends that if you're on Zoom or Teams you just hit leave, but the work that you get done, the integration, the mentoring, the learning I think is invaluable.So we're going to be having people that have been working remotely start to come back to work. We're working with each of them. It's almost a plan for every person to understand how we do that in each area, but I'm confident that we'll move through that. And early next year, we're going to share more with employees in the next couple of weeks and we'll have people come back.And then the final question you asked was training, and we actually on this site also have technical training. So for our-- especially our manufacturing team, when they need to learn how to build an EV and to do it safely because if you think about very different from an internal combustion engine to safely designing, testing, validating, and building and servicing electric vehicles, and there's training that happens right here. But we actually have a senior leader dedicated to make sure we do all that safely and our people are trained.ANDY SERWER: And charging stations, a big issue across the country. You just signed an agreement with Pilot. How are you thinking about that and how it connects to the vehicles that you make?MARY BARRA: Well, charging is the next hurdle. Once people get past range anxiety, and all of the EVs we have coming will be 30-- over 300 miles on a charge or more, if a person chooses on select models. So the next issue becomes but where can I charge it? And so we've learned for most people if they own a garage, they'd like to charge at home. And that's why for instance, on the volt EV and EUV, we provide-- we are providing assistance or providing the charger for them.But as we look and look across the country, we know there needs to be more done for the charging infrastructure. And so our arrangement with the Pilot company is to put charging at the location so as people are on a road trip, because Pilot covers most of the country, they're going to have the opportunity to charge. If they're a GM vehicle owner, they'll have the ability to have special discounts and know that they have availability.We're also doing work with our dealers because if you think about our dealers, they know the communities and-- very well and not just to charge at the dealership but for where do we install chargers in the local community? And so we have a partnership with our dealers that we're investing. Overall GM is investing 3/4 of $1,000,000,000 to support a robust charging infrastructure. We're also working with a number of other startup EV charging companies to make sure that charge anxiety is something that people don't have to worry about.ANDY SERWER: Final question, Mary. Governor Newsom in California has mandated that all new vehicle sales in the state of California after 2035 need to be EVs. Is that reasonable, possible, and what do you anticipate in terms of other states or countries mandating rules like that?MARY BARRA: Well, first of all, we're very aligned with what Governor Newsom mandated because at the beginning of last year, we said our plan is to have all of our light duty vehicles be electric by 2035. So that's the plan that we're working, so we'll be ready. So your question is it feasible? Absolutely. I do believe there will be other states. I know there's other states looking or have already made similar decisions, and we know that's happening in countries in Europe, as well. So we're well positioned to meet that challenge, and we think it's the right thing to do.ANDY SERWER: Mary Barra, thank you so much for your time.MARY BARRA: Thank you.]"

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Delta Air Lines DAL, American Airlines AAL, United Airlines UAL, Gol Linhas GOL and Copa Holdings CPA.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Airline Stock Outlook: Delta's Q3 Earnings &amp; MoreOn Oct 13, Delta Air Lines kick-started the third-quarter 2022 earnings season in the airline space. This Atlanta-based carrier reported lower-than-expected earnings per share due to high costs and Hurricane Ian–induced disruptions. American Airlines was also in the news when its management upped the revenue growth forecast for the September quarter owing to strong air-travel demand. An expansion update from United Airlines was also available in the past week.However, Latin American carrier Gol Linhas expects to incur a loss in the third quarter due to high fuel costs even though air-travel demand remains strong. Another Latin American carrier Copa Holdings’ traffic increased in September from the comparable period’s level in 2019 (pre-coronavirus), again reflecting upbeat air-travel demand.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1. Delta’s third-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 42 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.51 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56. DAL reported earnings of 30 cents per share a year ago, dull in comparison to the current scenario, as air-travel demand was not so buoyant then. In the third quarter of 2022, total revenues increased more than 52% on a year-over-year basis. The same increased 11% from third-quarter 2019 actuals.The fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted revenue guidance is encouraging and expected to increase in the 5-9% band from the fourth-quarter 2019 actuals, driven by strength in domestic air-travel demand and fast-recovering international travel demand. While air-travel demand is very strong for leisure, business travel is also bouncing back. Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected in the 9-11% range.Story continues2.  American Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects total revenues for third-quarter 2022 to rise approximately 13% from the third-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier expectation: increase 10-12%). Total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a measure of unit revenue) is now anticipated to be 25% higher than the third-quarter 2019 reading (earlier estimate was a 20-24% rise).Driven by upbeat demand, the pre-tax margin, excluding net special items, is anticipated to be 4.5% compared with the 2-4% band expected earlier. The third-quarter operating margin (excluding net special items) is expected to be roughly 7%. The average fuel cost per gallon forecast is maintained in the $3.73-$3.78 range. However, the guidance for fuel gallons consumed is decreased to 1,031 million from 1,040 million.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3. For the third quarter of 2022 (detailed results of which will be out on Oct 27), Gol Linhas anticipates EBITDA margin to be approximately 15% and the EBIT margin to be roughly 5%. GOL estimates an average fuel price per liter to be R$ 6.62. Management anticipates a loss per share of R$1.8, indicating a loss Per American Depositary Shares of 70 cents for the third quarter.Fuel unit costs are anticipated to grow almost 87% from the prior-year actuals, backed by an 89% increase in the average jet fuel price. Passenger unit revenues for the to-be-reported quarter are expected to increase roughly 45% from the year-ago reported figure, driven by upbeat domestic air-travel demand (mainly for leisure) and the gradual recovery in international travel.Reflecting bullish air-travel demand, GOL’s consolidated traffic in September increased 41.4% from the year-ago level. That story was covered in detail in the previous week’s write-up.4. In September 2022, Copa Holdings’ traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), increased 3.5% to 1.75 billion from the comparable period’s level in 2019. Increased passenger volume led to this upside. To match upbeat demand, CPA is increasing capacity — measured in available seat miles (ASMs) — which inched up 1.2% from the 2019 level to 2 billion. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) improved 200 basis points (bps) to 86.9% in the last month.5. United Airlines reportedly decided to add flights to Australian cities with the relaxation of COVID-related travel restrictions and the surge in air-travel demand. UAL plans to fly nonstop from San Francisco International Airport to Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney; from Los Angeles International Airport to Melbourne and Sydney; and from Houston to Sydney.PerformanceThe table above shows that all airline stocks, apart from Gol Linhas, have traded in the green over the five trading days. Gol’s forecast of a third-quarter loss might have induced the southward movement of the stock. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index has inched up 0.4% to $52.88 over the past five trading days. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has plummeted 34.3%.What's Next in the Airline Space?Investors will keenly await the third-quarter 2022 results of United Airlines and American Airlines, scheduled to be out on Oct 18 and Oct 20, respectively. We expect strong air-travel demand to have aided the top-line performances of both UAL and AAL. However, high fuel costs are likely to have dented their bottom-line performances.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

(NYSE:PNC) shares last year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/more-money-bank-insiders-divested-120040339.html,1666094440,STORY,['PNC'],"[Despite the fact that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) stock rose 3.3% last week, insiders who sold US$4.1m worth of stock in the previous 12 months are likely to be better off. Holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale. Thus selling at an average price of US$191, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best decision.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, Michael Lyons, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$183 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$156. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In total, PNC Financial Services Group insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.PNC Financial Services Group Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of PNC Financial Services Group shares. In total, Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking Michael Lyons dumped US$584k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that PNC Financial Services Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$211m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought PNC Financial Services Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But it is good to see that PNC Financial Services Group is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing PNC Financial Services Group.

""We'll see how they react throughout the holiday season, but when we talk to them they continue to say they want to celebrate the holidays.""Shares of the discount retailer rose 3% after Cornell's upbeat commentary. Despite Cornell's optimism, the U.S. consumer continues to be in a precarious spot headed into 2023.First, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are still mired in double-digit percentage declines for the year as the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates to beat back inflation. The bear market — coupled with pressured home prices as a result of the Fed's actions — is weighing on household net worth and spending plans.Los Angeles, CA - September 07: Shamita Jayakumar shops at Target as she does about every other week at the Jefferson Blvd location on Wednesday, Sept. 7, 2022 in Los Angeles,(Dania Maxwell / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)Not helping matters is consumer price inflation hovering near 40-year highs, causing shoppers to trade down. Cornell acknowledged sky-high inflation but pointed out that the 3.5% unemployment rate remains relatively low.""On one side, we have got inflation that is at a 40-year high, but unemployment is incredibly low — and I think those two things are balancing out right now,"" Cornell said.Still, the labor market is showing its first signs of cracks.Reports of Intel laying off thousands of workers amid a slowdown in PC sales surfaced a week ago.

He leads a team of more than 400,000 people working in almost 2,000 stores throughout the United States. Cornell is tackling some big issues head on. Inflation, a slowing economy, and those pesky supply chain issues.But in a year of retail train wrecks-- yeah, that's you, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond-- Target has outpaced the competition. In the fight to stay ahead, Cornell has made some very tough decisions, embracing the athletes mantra, no pain, no gain. And so far, it seems to be working. Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell joins us now. Brian, good to see you in person at Yahoo Finance HQ.BRIAN CORNELL: It's great to be back together.BRIAN SOZZI: So I've been making a list. I've been going to Target. I go there every weekend. You know this. And I'm like, I have to ask Brian these things when he's in person. First, the retail inventory glut. Is it over? When does it end?BRIAN CORNELL: Yeah. Well, Brian, one, I appreciate the fact that you're always in our stores. And you do send me notes. And I appreciate that. And you know back in June, we made a pretty bold and decisive decision. We said, all right. Inventories have built up. Consumer shopping habits have changed. They moved into different categories. And we said we're going to get out in front of us.So for Target, we put that inventory problem behind us. And now we can focus on great execution, delighting our guests, getting ready for the big holiday season. So we were pretty decisive and said, we're not going to just let this roll into the next quarter. We'll deal with it up front. And now we're excited that we're ready to play for the holiday season.BRIAN SOZZI: I've followed your entire time as CEO at Target. And you've made a bunch of bold decisions. You exited Canada. First thing you did. I remember writing on that story as soon as it was out. Your 2017 investor conference. You were investing billions of dollars. Market didn't like it. Now you're clearing out inventory. How hard is it to make these decisions as a leader?Story continuesBRIAN CORNELL: Well, if I think about each one of those decisions, there was probably a very similar model that we followed. We said, all right. What's the right thing for the Target brand? What's the right thing for the Target guest? What's the right thing for our team? And when we think about it through that lens, it's always the right thing for our shareholder long term.So whether it was leaving Canada and putting all of our focus on the US business or making that decision back in 2017 when others were closing stores, we said, we're going to double down on stores and put stores at the center of our strategy.We took the same approach this summer and said, all right. Across all of retail, inventories have risen. We're going to get out in front of this and make sure that we have the right assortment, we deliver great value, we protect that guest experience in our stores, and we also did the right thing for our team.BRIAN SOZZI: I think you mentioned this is your ninth holiday season as CEO of Target. How do you think this season will shape up compared to those other eight or nine?BRIAN CORNELL: Well, Brian, you kno we spend a lot of time talking to consumers, talking to our guests. And the one thing we've heard throughout this year is they want to enjoy and celebrate seasonal moments. So the guest has told us they're excited about Halloween. It's still a few days away.They're looking forward to Thanksgiving and celebrating with family and friends. And they are looking forward to the Christmas holidays. So we know the consumer in America, the guests that shops Target, they are excited about seasonal holidays. And we're going to be ready to make sure we delight them.BRIAN SOZZI: Recession? Any indications you see? Store traffic? What they're buying? Anything that would suggest this could be a gloomy holiday season?BRIAN CORNELL: Well, everyone's talking about recession. And sitting here today, there's different points of view. You talk to bank CEOs. Some gloom and doom. Others are saying really healthy consumer.What we've seen all year long is really healthy traffic and a guest that's shopping in our stores and shopping online so that strength in traffic has been driving our business. We've delivered solid comps throughout this year. We expect that to continue over the balance of the holiday season.BRIAN SOZZI: All right. That's good to hear. So back to my shopping list here, if you can just indulge me.BRIAN CORNELL: Let's do it.BRIAN SOZZI: 42 count of Tide Pods online-- $13. Now, I'm a dumb millennial. I don't keep track of things that I buy in terms of price. But to me, that seems like a lot. Are shoppers to your stores trading down? That seems like a lot of money for a basic essential.BRIAN CORNELL: Well, Brian, core to our proposition is making sure we deliver great value and affordability every time you shop. So we measure pricing really carefully versus our competition. And we want to make sure we're priced right daily, we deliver great value and affordability. So on those items that you're looking at, we've got to make sure we have the right price every time you shop. And the guest expects that from Target.BRIAN SOZZI: How is your private label business doing in this inflationary backdrop?BRIAN CORNELL: It's been booming. So we now have a $30 billion own-brand business. $30 billion. And it's performed incredibly well throughout the pandemic and continues to grow.So whether you're shopping Good and Gather or getting something for yourself, Goodfellow, that you can wear on set, or shopping any of our great brands. We now have $11 billion own brands in our portfolio. So that business just continues to perform and will perform over the holiday season.BRIAN SOZZI: It's huge, Brian. So yesterday, I was actually in Bay Shore Target. Every weekend Bay Shore Target. Shout out Bay Shore Target. 15 registers open. 2 of them were self checkout. But 15 registers total. 11 were closed. Is that the worker shortage?BRIAN CORNELL: Brian, we've been staffed throughout the pandemic. I mean, we have 400,000 team members across the country. And going back to 2017, you remember. We made a big commitment back then to invest in our team.We said in 2017 we were going to get to a starting minimum wage to $15. Now, sitting here today, we made another big investment just a few months ago to say, all right, depending on the market, we're going to start at either $15, but it could be as much as $24 an hour to make sure that we have the team in place. We're going to hire another 100,000 seasonal team members for this holiday season.So because of our investment in wages, in benefits, in training-- you know that we launched a debt-free educational assistance program last year. We've had over 70,000 team members raise their hands and say, I want to take advantage of that. So those investments have allowed us to retain and attract great talent. And we'll continue to make sure our team is our most valuable asset.BRIAN SOZZI: 100,000 workers. That's a lot. Are you confident you can get that number?BRIAN CORNELL: We are. We're off to a great start.BRIAN SOZZI: Interesting. So you spent some time in the grocery industry. Of course, Target is big in selling groceries. And I know you watch the competition. What do you think about this Kroger and Albertsons merger? Does this change the game for the grocery industry? And does it make you change how you think about your grocery offerings?BRIAN CORNELL: Well, we'll watch it carefully. Obviously, it's a new announcement. It's going to take some time to close. But we're going to continue to focus on our food and beverage business. We've seen really strong growth and market share gains for over 20 consecutive quarters. So the strength of that business has really connected with the guest during the pandemic and has come out of the pandemic is really a strong driver of growth.So we're all in on the food and beverage business. We'll continue to invest. We've had a couple of great owned brands there. Good and Gather is a $2 billion brand for us now in food and beverage. The guest is really responded to a brand called Favorite Day. So we feel really good about food and beverage driving traffic and complementing our multi-category portfolio.BRIAN SOZZI: I think I've seen wine at a Target too. These are big departments.BRIAN CORNELL: They are.BRIAN SOZZI: They're becoming really important to us.BRIAN CORNELL: They're really important. And it's important for our guest. So we always listen to the guest. And they've told us food and beverage is an important category for them. It drives traffic. But I also know when they're there, they're beauty. They're shopping apparel. They're getting something for their home. So it complements our business really nicely.BRIAN SOZZI: The new shops, the new cosmetic shops inside of Target, how are they starting?BRIAN CORNELL: Oh, the Ulta Beauty inside of Target, it's been great.BRIAN SOZZI: Bay Shore just got one. Again, shout out Bay Shore Target. It's a big part of the store. And the interesting thing is Brian-- and you know this, obviously-- walk into a store, it's right there. It's the first thing you see when you walk into these stores.BRIAN CORNELL: Well, beauty has been an important category for years now. And Ulta just complements our beauty offering. And it was one of the things that our guest told us. We said, all right, what brand would you like to see here? On the top of their list, they said we love Starbucks. We love the fact you've got Disney stores--BRIAN SOZZI: Don't take away my Starbucks.BRIAN CORNELL: --and Apple stores. But they love the fact that we've added Ulta Beauty. So those partnerships, whether it's CVS and pharmacy and Starbucks in almost every store, more Apple shops, more Disney shops, and now Ulta, it just complements the great offering we have of national brands and own brands.BRIAN SOZZI: You just signed on for another-- I think the press release said about three years. So let's just say three years. What is the next three years in Brian Cornell's life look like in terms of chairman and CEO of Target?BRIAN CORNELL: I think it's going to be another chapter of growth for our company and continuing to invest in remodeling stores and building new stores in great locations like Bay Shore, developing our own brands, accelerating our national brand partnerships, and making sure that we continue to invest in our team. And there's lots of things I'm proud of. And the fact that we added $30 billion of growth since the start of the pandemic is something that our team feels really good about.What I feel to me most-- what really fires me up is the investments that we've made in our team and seeing the diversity in our organization, seeing the growth opportunities, seeing our culture come to life. When I talk about culture, we always talk about a culture of care and growth and winning together. That's something that I'm going to continue to focus on for years to come.BRIAN SOZZI: Brian, I've only known you to be a fired up guy. You're fired up right now talking about the Target's business and its future. Where does that come from on a personal level?BRIAN CORNELL: Well, for me, this is an amazing brand. And I've got to tell you, Brian, I wake up every day feeling the responsibility of leading the Target brand, those 400,000 team members that work for us, those families that depend on us across the country. So I wake up with a huge sense of responsibility. And the pride I have in the team and that brand and the role we play in America is something that gets me up each and every day feeling great about the role that I sit in today.BRIAN SOZZI: Growing up, did you see yourself as a CEO?BRIAN CORNELL: Well, Brian, I think you know my story. And I grew up right down the road here in Queens as a poor kid who kind of has worked for everything I've had. And I never even imagined I'd be sitting in a chair like this. But I embraced the moment. And I just feel proud to work for a great company.BRIAN SOZZI: I was just having a moment there. I very much identify with that, Brian. That much is for sure. How have you balanced it all? This has been a very challenging three years for executives. Not just CEOs. CFOs. COOs. How do you balance this time? And how do you just stay grounded?BRIAN CORNELL: Yeah. Well, I'll go back to I work with a great leadership team, the best leadership team I've ever been part of. I have an amazing wife who's been married to me for 40 years now, a great family that supports me. And, as you know, I take care of myself. I make sure that I get to the gym every day and workout.BRIAN SOZZI: You called my out on that. Yes, I shouted that out. And full disclosure, when, Brian, that news hit the wires that you were staying for three years, I said, look, Brian's a fit guy. He can stay on for another 15 years. How do you think about succession? At some point, you will not be the CEO of Target. Shareholders I'm sure won't like it. But is that one of your most important jobs right now outside of planning for holidays?BRIAN CORNELL: Yeah. I think for any CEO, succession has to be something you focus on every day, not just for my role, but for my leadership team and the officers in those key roles throughout the company.So we spent a tremendous amount of time. I have a fabulous HR partner, Melissa Kramer. And we spend time every week talking about talent. Last week, I was traveling. I was in Washington DC. I had a group of 28 Black Target officers that were with us in DC. We visited stores together. We spent time with outside speakers.And I'm always investing in talent and making sure I get to know the team, I spend time with them, we travel together. But as a CEO of a company like ours, $106 billion growth company, you've got to constantly be focusing on talent development and thinking about who are the future leaders that are going to guide this company whenever that day comes and I'm not here.BRIAN SOZZI: Fair enough. Before we let you go-- we're running short on time here-- let's go back to the economy real quick because you are up against the holiday shopping season. So you see no recession. You think consumers will spend this season like they spent last season.BRIAN CORNELL: I think it's just a very unusual time from an economic standpoint. We're coming out of a pandemic. There were lots of stimulus checks that have been written, lots of child care support. We're starting to see a consumer get back to normal life. They want to travel again. They're out in restaurants. So sitting here today, we're on one side, we've got inflation that's at a 40-year high, but unemployment incredibly low. And I think those two things are balancing out right now.So we continue to see a healthy guest shopping in our stores and shopping online. We'll see how they react throughout the holiday season. But when we talk to them, they continue to say they want to celebrate the holidays. And we know they're out on the streets of New York. They're in restaurants. They're in our stores. So right now, we're seeing a stable environment.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you worry about-- I'm sure in the greenroom you heard Hilton CEO Chris Nassetta just talked to us about what the Fed may do to the economy. Do you fear the Fed and what they're doing?BRIAN CORNELL: Well, we've got to watch it carefully. But in our business, Brian, we've got to be agile. We've got to prepare for any environment. It's part of the strength of our multi-category portfolio. We sell food and beverage products and household essentials. We have all your beauty needs. We have toys for kids and apparel and home items. So we'll balance our portfolio to make sure we're meeting the needs of the consumer no matter what the environment looks like.BRIAN SOZZI: All right. Let's leave it there. Brian Cornell, always good to see you.BRIAN CORNELL: Great to see you.BRIAN SOZZI: It's been pleasure following your time as CEO of Target. I'm looking forward to continuing to follow it, indeed.]"

Is that the worker shortage?BRIAN CORNELL: Brian, we've been staffed throughout the pandemic. I mean, we have 400,000 team members across the country. And going back to 2017, you remember, we made a big commitment back then to invest in our team. We said in 2017, we were going to get to a starting minimum wage at $15.Now, sitting here today, we made another big investment just a few months ago to say, all right, depending on the market, we're going to start at either $15, but it could be as much as $24 an hour. To make sure that we have the team in place, we're going to hire another 100,000 seasonal team members for this holiday season.So because of our investment in wages, in benefits, in training-- you know that we launched a debt-free educational assistance program last year.

ISRG is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 18, after the closing bell.The company’s stock has declined 49.1% so far this year compared with a decrease of 38.2% for the industry.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 1.72%. Its earnings beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, missed once and came in line once, the average surprise being 1.36%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ3 EstimatesCurrently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.52 billion, suggesting an improvement of 8.6% from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings stands at $1.10 per share, indicating a decline of 7.7% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteThe Instruments &amp; Accessories segment is likely to have witnessed a strong third quarter on the back of growth in da Vinci procedure volume as seen in the past two quarters. However, unfavorable currency movements and a resurgence in COVID-19 infections are likely to partially offset gains due to recovering demand in procedures. These effects are likely to be reflected in the third-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Instruments &amp; Accessories segment revenues stands at $873 million, suggesting growth of 13.1% year over year.Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci capital placements are likely to have been on the lower side due to lesser trade-in of systems (majority of U.S. customers have upgraded to newer generation systems), continued supply chain challenges impacting the availability of semiconductor components and growing capital spending pressure on hospitals amid rising inflationary pressure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of the da Vinci system in the United States is pegged at 177 units, suggesting 4.1% year-over-year growth.However, the company’s da Vinci capital placements have been benefiting from rising demand outside the United States. Intuitive Surgical placed 129 systems in the second quarter compared with 115 in the prior-year quarter in ex-U.S. markets. The trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter. The company expects the growth of the single port (SP) platform to have been driven by additional clinical indications and clearances in markets beyond the United States and Korea. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the sales of the da Vinci system outside the United States is 127 units, suggesting 28.3% year-over-year growth.Story continuesDuring the second quarter, the use of Intuitive Surgical’s digital product, Intuitive Hub, exhibited strong growth year over year. The company is in discussions with the FDA on how best to characterize some of its core artificial intelligence technology. It will continue to bring its flexible endoscopy platform Ion to scale and boost capacity, quality and cost improvements while seeking to expand access to new markets. These developments might have contributed to Intuitive Surgical’s third-quarter performance.ISRG’s new platforms made advancements in commercialization, innovation and clinical programs. This trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter as well. However, higher logistics costs during the reported quarter amid supply-chain challenges and rising inflationary pressure are likely to have driven expenses higher, hurting margins.Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

(NYSE:V) Stock A Sign That The Market Could be Wrong Given Its Strong Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-visa-inc-nyse-v-120122809.html,1666094482,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (NYSE:V) has had a rough three months with its share price down 13%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Visa's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Visa How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Visa is:41% = US$15b ÷ US$35b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.41 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Visa's Earnings Growth And 41% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Visa has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 17% which is quite remarkable. This probably laid the groundwork for Visa's moderate 11% net income growth seen over the past five years.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Visa's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 14% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for V? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Visa Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Visa has a low three-year median payout ratio of 23%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 77% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.Additionally, Visa has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 20%. However, Visa's ROE is predicted to rise to 54% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Visa's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

Similar legislation related to the Company’s debit routing practices was passed into law back in 2010. Not unlike the previous legislation, the Company’s value proposition to merchants, consumers and bank-issuing customers and acquirers is robust enough to help blunt the potential effects the legislation might have in the near term.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Mueffling's investment philosophy and performance, go directly to Top 5 Stock Picks of William Von Mueffling's Cantillon Capital Management.William Von Mueffling worked at Lazard Asset Management before launching Cantillon Capital Management in 2003. He rose to fame while at Lazard Asset Management by posting 30% annualized returns during 1998-2003. That level of return during the extended market turmoil was made possible through timely short positions on several Internet high-fliers. Currently, he is the CEO and CIO of Cantillon Capital Management, an investment firm with more than $14 billion in assets under management.Mueffling used a traditional long/short strategy when he started Cantillon Capital Management. However, the hedge fund saw net withdrawals in 2008 as its funds experienced a loss. To everyone's surprise, he gave up shorting as an investment strategy the following year, highlighting how difficult it was to short when the government was creating money. Mueffling beat several other hedge funds, although his gains were still relatively small when assessed in terms of absolute returns. His hedge fund dropped 7%-8% up until May 2009.According to a Wall Street Journal story from 2010, Cantillon Capital Management's strategy is to look for businesses that deliver above-average returns on shareholder equity but are properly valued in relation to their income streams. Additionally, Mueffling stated in an interview with Graham &amp; Doddsville, the Columbia Business School newsletter:“One can broadly divide value investing into two camps. The first camp is the Graham &amp; Dodd style which is buying assets at a discount or cash at a discount. The second camp is the Buffett style, which I characterize as buying financial productivity at a discount. We fall into the second camp. We believe that there are many different types of moats to be found, and that a moat around a business should allow it to produce outsized margins and wonderful returns on capital. The trick is being able to buy this stream of cash flows at a discount. Unlike Graham &amp; Dodd investing where you might look at low price-to-book value companies or net-net companies, we are trying to buy high financial productivity at a discount to its intrinsic value.”Story continuesTop 10 Stock Picks of William von Mueffling's Cantillon Capital ManagementWilliam Von Mueffling of Cantillon Capital ManagementCantillon Capital Management announced 39 portfolio changes in the second quarter of 2022.

(NYSE:V) is a company that provides digital payment services. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) Canada and TD Securities launched innovative cooperation on October 6 as the first financial institution in Canada to join Visa B2B Connect, a cross-border business-to-business (B2B) payments network that enables account-to-account international transfers rapidly, securely, and reliably.On August 16, Daiwa analyst Kazuya Nishimura downgraded Visa Inc.

(NYSE:V) and discussed its stance on the firm. Here is what the fund said:“It was business as usual for Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) as it delivered another solid quarter driven by strong US growth, the ongoing gradual displacement of cash with digital transactions, and accelerated growth in cross-border volume as travel spending plays catch up post-Covid. Visa processed 49.3 billion transactions on its network, up 16% year-on-year and 39% above pre-pandemic levels, driving $2.7 trillion in total payments volume, both of which have more than recovered from the impacts of the pandemic. The total number of cards in Visa’s network also grew by 8% year-on-year to 3.9 billion.Cross-border transactions were a key issue for Visa during the pandemic, but this headwind has now turned into a tailwind. Constant currency cross-border volumes rose 40% (48% excluding intra-Europe) in the most recent quarter and we expect this trend will continue to play out in the year ahead. While a potential economic slowdown and geopolitical concerns are always a risk, we take comfort in the fact that Visa has a sixty-plus year track record of successfully overcoming numerous macroeconomic challenges that in the moment appeared insurmountable. We believe this current episode will prove no different and that the combination of a very attractive industry structure and the ongoing secular shift towards digital payments provides a foundation that will enable Visa to continue winning for many years to come.”6.

326,e3b7c9e7-e6f3-3c9f-8032-146dc49bcc8b,V,2022-10-18,Visa Inc. (V) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-v-attracting-investor-130001019.html,1666011601,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this global payments processor have returned -5.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9% change. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, to which Visa belongs, has lost 11.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Visa is expected to post earnings of $1.86 per share, indicating a change of +14.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.44 points to a change of +25.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.6%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.33 indicates a change of +11.9% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Visa is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $7.57 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +15.4%. The $29.08 billion and $32.16 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +20.7% and +10.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.28 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $1.98 for the same period compares with $1.49 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.11%. The EPS surprise was +13.79%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

332,246b5f3d-7bb5-31a4-bb28-3417e1ac3f7a,NWSA,2022-10-18,Fox (FOXA) and News Corp to Merge Under One Media Empire,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-foxa-news-corp-merge-164904832.html,1666025344,STORY,"['FOXA', 'NWSA']","[Fox Corporation’s FOXA founder Rupert Murdoch recently announced that the company is considering a merger with the media publishing company, News Corporation NWSA.Special board committees have been established by both companies and are at an initial stage of discussion to evaluate a possible deal and potential financial terms.A merger of the two companies would likely be structured as a stock deal. The exchange ratio reflecting the relative value of each company would be negotiated by the board committees of independent directors.What Does This Merger Bring to Fox?This merger of Fox Corporation and News Corporation would bring back high-profile business divisions under one roof after a split in 2013. Fox’s Fox News, Fox broadcast network, local TV stations and the Tubi streaming service would be combined with News Corp’s Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, as well as other assets including HarperCollins Publishers and news organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia.This would diversify and broaden the portfolio of Fox Corporation hence gaining traction with more customers and adding new sources of revenue to its top line.Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteThe publishing wing of Murdoch’s empire, News Corp has been performing better than expected. The Journal, part of its Dow Jones unit, enjoyed robust growth in its digital-subscription business over the past few years. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Digital-only subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products rose 9% year over year.The digital real-estate unit and book-publishing business also have propelled growth. Revenues in the Digital Real Estate Services segment increased 7% year over year to $443 million in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022.Fox’s driving engine has been Fox News with Fox News Channel once again closing August as the best-performing news brand for 18 consecutive months. Fox News usually attracts more prime-time audiences than its rivals and is competitive with the more widely distributed broadcast networks as well.Murdoch sees potential moneymaking and cost-saving opportunities in joining the two companies. The new company could look for ways to integrate its media properties. It could also explore ways to use the company’s assets for emerging business lines, such as sports betting, for which Fox has already laid a foundation by launching a sports-betting platform called Fox Bet along with the Stars Group in 2019.The merged companies could potentially save money by hiring one management team and maintaining one set of relationships with vendors, the people said.Story continuesThreats Attached to Proposed MergerHowever, this merger also brings some headwinds for Fox. Readers’ preference for accessing news online, mostly free, has made News Corporation’s print-advertising model increasingly redundant.Digital platforms, such as Meta Platform’s META Facebook, Twitter TWTR, Google and Amazon, which have higher mass penetration, audience data and targeting capabilities, may impact News Corporation’s share of the digital display advertising market.Meta benefits from increasing mobile ad revenues and growing adoption of stories by advertisers across Instagram. Twitter’s initiatives to add features and focus on effectively tackling abuse issues are helping it to expand the monetized user base, thereby driving ad revenues.A major portion of News Corporation’s total revenues is generated outside the United States. The ongoing foreign exchange fluctuation or the U.S. dollar gaining strength may hurt both the top and bottom lines of the company.Fox’s cable TV business also faces a serious threat from OTT platforms due to cord-cutting and changing consumer preferences. This does not bode well for Fox.In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Cable Network Programming EBITDA decreased 6.8% year over year to $628 million. The EBITDA margin contracted 520 bps to 43%.Fox, which currently has Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) declined 14.5% year to date against the Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector, which was down 41.7%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With responses from more than 1,100 business decision makers (BDMs), IT decision makers (ITDMs) and employees, the resulting “Time to Change the Way We Work” report uncovered a significant gap between perceptions of key business priorities for their organization in the new hybrid-work era.“Leadership all too often falls into a trap of viewing the business through rose colored glasses, which can result in a disconnect between enterprise expectations and employee sentiment around the solutions and disciplines necessary to stay competitive and drive workplace transformation,” said Massimo Peselli, CRO, Global Enterprise and Public Sector, Verizon Business. “The more closely aligned business leaders and employees are, the more successful they will be transitioning during this period of ‘great experimentation.’ Verizon’s deep portfolio of UCC and CX solutions and expertise are purposefully designed to meet the needs of every customer, particularly those with diverse and hybrid workforces.”Story continuesOrganizational Myopia Impacts Business OperationsThe report found significant differences between how BDMs and employees view the workplace—a phenomenon we call “organizational myopia”, or corporate shortsightedness, with ITDMs somewhere in the middle. BDMs were around twice as likely as employees to say personal productivity (75% and 38%) and employee well-being (71% and 35%) had improved since the pre-COVID era. But the greatest gap was in customer satisfaction, with nearly three times as many BDMs (74%) seeing improvement versus just 25% of employees.Employees and BDMs also differed on whether employees have the tools and the flexibility they need to work effectively wherever they are, with BDMs more likely than employees to say their organization provided them the tools and flexibility needed to succeed, such as:Contact center technology (87% of BDMs vs 67% of employees)Collaboration and communication technology (93% of BDMs vs 76% of employees)Business systems and technology (94% of BDMs vs 74% of employees)Flexibility to work wherever they are most productive (91% of BDMs vs 76% of employees)Further compounding the issue, technology is not viewed as a strategic investment by more than one third (36%) of BDMs, while outdated business systems and technology are cited as barriers to success by nearly half of employees (49%). A major part of that disconnect lies within the contact center. With front line agents serving customers, lack of budget (35%), a lack of integration between different channel platforms (34%), and a lack of in-house skills (33%) were viewed as the most significant barriers to achieving successful outcomes—reflecting some parallels with the overall employee experience.Bridging the Perception Gap with Workplace RedesignEffective leadership requires organizations to continually learn from what is working and what isn’t, to engage all stakeholders in this learning process and to make the investments needed to succeed. It comes down to the people, the processes and the technology—and creating a workplace that ensures employees receive a positive experience from recruitment to retirement.Ultimately, businesses need to approach the employee experience (EX) with the same care that they approach the customer experience (CX). Frontline workers and contact center agents have been largely underserved by modern technology and services. By ensuring they are key stakeholders in identifying the needs of customers and agents, and that they are fully included in the decision-making process, this can change. This is not the case in 72% of organizations.As a leader in the communication, collaboration and customer experience space, Verizon is uniquely positioned to help our customers create new models within their workplaces that are designed to support both the business and the employees.For the full findings highlighting gaps between how business decision makers, IT decision makers and employees view the workplace and the tools they use, download the full report.

As value investor Shelby Collum Davis, founder of Davis Funds, once observed, ""You make most of your money in a bear market, you just dont realize it at the time.""One such value opportunity to emerge from the current bear market is Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), the telecommunication company that shares the U.S. wireless market with AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile US Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS). This rule of three in the telecom market creates a stable structure for relatively rational pricing. Everyone makes money, but not so much money that the government steps in to break the company up (like the threat now facing Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL), which is reaching monopoly status).Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with VZ. Click here to check it out. VZ 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VZPeter Lynch Chart of VZTrading near a 10-year low, the company's stock has fallen off even more than the S&amp;P 500 in this bear market. I find this a strange as Verizon is, arguably, a safe stock with a low price-earnings ratio, high dividend yield and good financial conditions. It should also have low volatility.Does Verizon Offer Good Value at 10-Year Low?Verizon also sells an essential service. After food, clothing and shelter, a means to quick communication may now be the fourth most essential need.A brief company historyVerizon traces its history back to 1877, when Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, and his father-in-law formed the Bell Telephone Co. in Boston, which eventually evolved into the old AT&amp;T (called Ma Bell) before it was broken up.The company we know today was created on June 30, 2000 by the combination of two ""Baby Bells,"" Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp., in one of the largest mergers in U.S. business history. GTE and Bell Atlantic themselves evolved and grew through decades of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.In 2014, Verizon then bought out the 45% indirect interest in Verizon Wireless from Vodaphone PLC (VOD) in a transaction valued at approximately $130 billion to assume full ownership.Story continuesBussiness overviewThe main battleground within the telecom arena is the wireless market and within that, the premier 5G broadband wireless connectivity. Verizon, at one time, was the clear leader in the telecom market, but is now in a closely fought horse race with T-Mobile and AT&amp;T. T-Mobile (which combined with Sprint in 2020) is now in the lead with a newer 5G network, while a newly refocused and resurgent AT&amp;T is in second place. It appears Verizon has some catching up to do.Does Verizon Offer Good Value at 10-Year Low?Does Verizon Offer Good Value at 10-Year Low?Does Verizon Offer Good Value at 10-Year Low?Source: BusinesswireDoes Verizon Offer Good Value at 10-Year Low?Verizon's business is capital intensive. The biggest investment is in licensing spectrum from the the Federal Communications Commission, which auctions off spectrum to wireless telecom companies for an extended period of time (usually 10 to 15 years). Companies then use the licensed spectrum to offer wireless access to its customers. The licenses have continually renewed before expiry.Like most telecom companies, Verizon carries a lot of debt, but carrying it does not appear to be much of an issue. The debt-to-adjusted Ebitda ratio is 2.5, which is pretty good.Does Verizon Offer Good Value at 10-Year Low?Additionally, Verizon's return on invested capital has been consistently superior to its weighted average cost of capital, thus showing the company is creating value as it grows.Does Verizon Offer Good Value at 10-Year Low?The company also maintains wireline infrastructure, but this business is fairly small and mainly supports the wireless business by carrying backhaul data traffic from cellular towers to its data processing nodes. Leveraging its wireless capabilities, Verizon has increasingly deployed fixed wireless internet technology where it brings services to homes and businesses by connecting them to the nearest cell phone tower. This helps to defray its large fixed infrastructure costs over more points of access and makes greater use of its investments in spectrum.Fixed wireless has found its greatest success in rural areas, where the market is underserved and price sensitive.ValuationI think a straightforward discounted cash flow valuation using earnings per share should generate a ballpark value for Verizon. I used a starting figure of $4.77 (which is the normalized earnings per share over the last five years) and assumed a long-term growth rate of 2% and discount rate of 7%. Based on these fairly conservative assumptions, the valuation I get is around $60, which has a wide margin of safety.Does Verizon Offer Good Value at 10-Year Low?Verizon pays a dividend yield of 7.07%, which is growing at about 2% a year. The dividend payout ratio is reasonable at around 50%, so there is adequate margin of safety against a reduction. ConclusionInvesting in Verizon could be a good bet given the low price-earnings ratio of 7 and dividend yield of over 7%. The margin of safety is alsoquite comfortable. While the company has a large amount of debt, it has a huge cash flow to easily carry it.As a result, I think Verizon has good value. The average analyst is forecasting a 12-month price target of $49 and most have a hold recommendation. Does Verizon Offer Good Value at 10-Year Low?Morningstar's recommendation is also consistent, giving the name a five-star rating and $59 fair value assessment.

After all, few things in life are sweeter than payday.Dividends help cushion drawdowns in other positions, provide a passive income stream, and provide more than one way to profit from an investment.Of course, free cash flow is a vital metric to analyze when seeking dividend-paying stocks.In its simplest form, free cash flow is the cash a company keeps after paying for operating costs and capital expenditures.A high free cash flow allows for more growth opportunities, a greater potential for share buybacks, consistent dividend payouts, and the ability to pay off debt easily.Three stocks that pay investors handsomely paired with strong free cash flow include Pfizer PFE, Exxon Mobil XOM, and Verizon Communications VZ.Below is a year-to-date chart of all three stocks with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a deeper dive into each one.Verizon CommunicationsVerizon offers communication services in the form of local phone, long-distance, wireless, and data services.VZ has long been an income investor favorite, and its dividend metrics make it easy to see why – VZ’s annual dividend yields a steep 7.2%, notably higher than its Zacks sector average.Further, the company has upped its dividend payout five times over the last five years, translating to a 2% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company knows how to generate serious cash; in its latest quarter, VZ posted quarterly free cash flow of $6.2 billion, reflecting a massive 520% sequential increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor the cherry on top, Verizon’s valuation multiples could entice value-focused investors, further displayed by its Style Score of an A for Value.VZ’s forward earnings multiple currently sits at 7.0X, nowhere near its five-year median of 11.6X and reflecting a sizable 65% discount relative to its Zacks Sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesExxon MobilExxon Mobil is a U.S.-based oil and gas entity, one of the world's largest publicly traded energy companies.Analysts have had a bullish stance on the company’s earnings outlook as of late, helping land it into a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchXOM’s annual dividend yield comes in at a strong 3.6%, paired with a payout ratio sitting sustainably at 36% of earnings.While Exxon Mobil’s annual dividend yield is below its Zacks Sector average, the company’s 2.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps to pick up the slack.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn its latest earnings release, XOM reported quarterly free cash flow of a mighty $17.3 billion, penciling in a sizable 60% sequential uptick and an even more considerable triple-digit 151% year-over-year increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPfizerPfizer is a multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation headquartered in New York City, well-known for its COVID-19 vaccine.Pfizer’s dividend metrics would make any income-focused investors happy; its annual dividend yields a sizable 3.7%, notably higher than its Zacks Medical sector average.Further, the company pays out just 26% of its earnings and carries a strong 4.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPfizer posted quarterly free cash flow of $7.4 billion in its latest earnings release, reflecting a rock-solid 26% sequential increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPfizer shares are more than reasonably priced; shares trade at a 6.7X forward earnings multiple, nearly half of their five-year median of 12.6X and reflecting a sizable 68% discount relative to the Zacks Medical sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineInvestors love dividends, and for obvious reasons.In a historically-volatile year in the market so far in 2022, dividends have been a significant perk, helping to shield investors from drawdowns.Still, investors should look closely at a company’s free cash flow when selecting dividend-paying stocks. Free cash flow strength provides dividend reliability, more growth opportunities, and speaks volumes about a company’s financial footing.All three stocks above - Pfizer PFE, Exxon Mobil XOM, and Verizon Communications VZ – all reward their shareholders handsomely and are cash-generating machines, making them great considerations for any investor seeking a reliable income stream.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Key findings from the survey of nearly 2,000 first responders - which included representation from public safety answering points and emergency call centers as well as the police, fire and emergency medical services communities - included:Network reliability and speed matter most: First responders overwhelmingly think reliability and speed are the most important aspects of a public safety network, especially during an emergency. More than three quarters of first responders (77%) said reliability and resiliency was their No. 1 factor in daily use and nearly 60% asked for stronger connections in the field.Smartphones are public safety’s tool of choice: Nearly all (92%) of first responders say smartphones and tablets will remain essential daily communication tools in the next five years. Land mobile radios (LMRs) are used daily by 89% of first responders but usage is slowly declining.More devices mean being more connected: Public safety leaders said smartphones will remain their most important tech tool but internet-connected vehicles will become a much bigger priority within the next five years, with other technologies like augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications also growing in popularity.5G is a key priority: First responders say the benefits of 5G will have an important impact on the future of public safety, with the overwhelming majority (77%) recognizing 5G as a priority.NEW YORK, Oct. 17, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  If first responders have their way, the future of public safety will include more internet-connected devices, a continued emphasis on network reliability and resiliency during emergency response operations and far more demand for 5G in the coming years.Story continuesThese are among the key findings from a new Verizon Frontline Public Safety Communications Survey conducted by Lexipol, which asked nearly 2,000 first responders at fire and police departments, emergency medical services organizations, public safety answering points and emergency call centers about their public safety communications technology usage both now and in the future.The findings showed a strong dependence on smartphones, growing interest in new devices such as drones and the benefits of 5G, and a continuing demand for network reliability and features like interoperability when responding to an emergency.Reliability and speed top network prioritiesWhen asked what they wanted most from a public safety communications provider, first responders overwhelmingly named network reliability and speed as their top priorities.In daily use, more than three quarters of first responders (77%) say reliability and resiliency is their number one factor today, followed by cost (13%) and customer service (4%). In emergency situations, reliability and resiliency are even more important (81%), followed by interoperability (47%) and having durable devices (46%).Further bearing out these findings, first responders named an unreliable network, outdated tools and lack of interoperability as their top three challenges with their current public safety communications technology.Smartphones dominate daily workFirst responders overwhelmingly believe smartphones and tablets will remain essential daily communication tools in the next five years, with 92% of respondents saying they use a smartphone and 47% reporting tablet usage every day. Land mobile radios (LMRs) are used daily by 89% of first responders, but the survey shows that LMR usage is predicted to fall to 79% in five years.A newer generation of technology, including internet-connected vehicles, drones and augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications, such as those that enable the replication of dangerous training scenarios in an AR/VR environment, are all expected to grow enormously in popularity in the next five years. Respondents say they expect the use of internet-connected vehicles, such as ambulances, patrol cars and fire trucks, to grow in daily use, from 41% today to 64% by 2027.Drones could see an even bigger uptick in daily use, growing from 8% today to 40% in five years. AR and VR may also gain impressive numbers, from just 1% of first responders reporting daily use now to an expected 20% in five years.The future of public safety is more connectedOf all the technology challenges with their current communications tools, first responders say connection strength is their largest concern. When asked about features they want added to their communications technology, nearly 60% expressed a desire for stronger connections in the field. Other responses include faster upload and download speeds (39%), the ability to share location information with team members in the field (42%) and the ability to quickly share images, videos and other files from the field (37%).When asked to look ahead at what the top priorities would be for public safety agencies in five years, internet-connected vehicles were by far the most popular choice across all first responders at 37%. This number was even higher for emergency medical services at 41%. Fire departments had the most diverse priorities, with more firefighters selecting AR/VR training as a priority and less selecting smartphones and internet-connected vehicles when compared to other first responder groups.Priority on 5G growsThe survey also found public safety professionals are ready to take advantage of the enhanced communication and technological capabilities enabled by 5G.First responders say the benefits of 5G, such as higher speed and lower latency, will have an important impact on the future of public safety, with the overwhelming majority (77%) recognizing 5G as a priority. ​When asked about the benefits of 5G for public safety, first responders put reliability at the top (42%), followed by speed (34%), enhanced situational awareness and a more effective use of data (both 12%).Verizon Frontline is the advanced network built for first responders – developed over nearly three decades of partnership with public safety officials and agencies on the front lines – to meet their unique and evolving needs.Verizon Communications Inc.

The tech heavy NASDAQ index is down around 35% year to date and the markets have been volatile in 2022 given that the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates 5 times this year to fight inflation. As a result of the increases and the expected increases in the future, the median projection for the federal funds rate is 4.4% at the end of 2022 and 4.6% at the end of next year. That compares to the expectation of 2.5% for the expected federal funds rate in the long run.With higher rates, some businesses might invest less and some consumers might spend less. Less demand might make it harder for some businesses to grow their earnings or revenue like the market expects.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to have a well diversified portfolio of high quality stocks across multiple different sectors.

(NASDAQ:ASML) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,“ASML Holding N.V. designs and manufactures semiconductor production equipment. It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology.Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward.Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.”9.

The company is clearly exposed to the semiconductor cycle but also participates in the secular growth of cloud and AI adoption through its data center business. With these secular drivers intact and new products ramping up in the second half of the year, we are maintaining an overweight to the company.”Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc.

The report also showed he sold Nvidia call options bought in July 2021 for a loss of $361,476.The same report also shows Paul Pelosi exercised 200 call options to buy shares of Google-parent Alphabet in a transaction worth $2 million, while allowing call options in Walt Disney to expire for a loss of $132,824.All of those events occurred on Sept. 16, according to the transaction report.Paul Pelosi frequently trades shares of companies popular with many investors, including Apple, Microsoft and other tech companies.A 2012 law makes it illegal for lawmakers to use information from their work in Congress for their personal gain. The law requires them to disclose stock transactions by themselves or family members within 45 days.Senior House Democrats have yet to allow a vote on legislation restricting members of Congress and other government officials from trading stocks. Such legislation has been introduced in response to allegations that some lawmakers may have taken advantage of their positions for personal gain.Pelosi initially voiced skepticism of changes to the current law, but later allowed legislation to advance toward consideration by the chamber.In July, Paul Pelosi sold Nvidia shares days before the House approved legislation providing subsidies and tax credits worth over $70 billion to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry.An analysis by Unusual Whales, a service selling financial data, concluded that congressional lawmakers last year traded $290 million in stocks, options, cryptocurrency and other assets, and that they outperformed the market, on average.(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Josie Kao)]"

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA How Fast Is NVIDIA Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Recognition must be given to the that NVIDIA has grown EPS by 41% per year, over the last three years. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While NVIDIA did well to grow revenue over the last year, EBIT margins were dampened at the same time. So it seems the future may hold further growth, especially if EBIT margins can remain steady.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for NVIDIA.Story continuesAre NVIDIA Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$279b company like NVIDIA. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$11b. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.Is NVIDIA Worth Keeping An Eye On?NVIDIA's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, NVIDIA is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. Even so, be aware that  NVIDIA is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Although NVIDIA certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned -14.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has lost 12.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.73 per share, indicating a change of -37.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.47 points to a change of -21.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.54 indicates a change of +30.7% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nvidia.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NVDA _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $5.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -15.7%. The $27.39 billion and $31.25 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.8% and +14.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNvidia reported revenues of $6.7 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3%. EPS of $0.51 for the same period compares with $1.04 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.7 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.03%. The EPS surprise was -8.93%.Over the last four quarters, Nvidia surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nvidia is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

TMO is slated to release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 26, before market open.In the last reported quarter, Thermo Fisher’s earnings of $5.51 per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.9%. Its earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.5%.Let's discuss the factors that are likely to get reflected in the upcoming results.Factors at PlayThrough the months of the third quarter, Thermo Fisher’s Analytical Instruments segment is expected to have generated strong sales, banking on electron microscopy, chromatography, mass spectrometry, chemical analysis as well as the research and safety market channel businesses. The company is expected to have recorded growth, driven by a favorable business mix and new launches, including four new gas chromatography and GC-MS instruments to advance analytical testing for food, environmental, industrial, and pharmaceutical applications.Further, in terms of performance in high-growth and emerging markets, in the company’s flagship facility for cell culture media in Grand Island, NY, Thermo Fisher recently completed a capacity expansion to support customers' research, drug development, and production applications. Further, in its lab chemicals business in Geel, Belgium, the company completed a major expansion of the facility to support strong growth. These developments are expected to have contributed to the company’s revenues in Q3.However, supply issues and staffing shortages are expected to have deterred growth in a few areas within this business.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. price-eps-surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. QuotePer our model, this segment is expected to report revenues of $1.49 billion in Q3, up 15.2% year over year.Within the Life-Science Solutions segment, the company is expected to have registered strong growth in its bioproduction business, banking on progress with cell culture media, single-use technologies, and a rapidly growing purification resins business as well as the pharma services business. However, this might have been offset by lower revenues in the genetic sciences business due to a moderation in COVID testing revenues compared to the year-ago period.Story continuesOur model predicts Q3 segment revenues to be 3.24 billion, up 33% year over year.The Specialty Diagnostics segment (Clinical Diagnostics business from the molecular controls that go into testing kits) is expected to have registered positive contributions in the form of continued growth in the immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Looking at the consistently growing resurgence of the virus-led healthcare needs, the Microbiology, Healthcare Market Channel and Clinical Diagnostics businesses are expected to have witnessed strong growth in Q3.

INGN has been gaining on the back of its high prospects in the portable oxygen concentrator (POC) space. Solid performance in the second quarter of 2022 and a strong product portfolio also buoy optimism. Headwinds resulting from stiff competition and foreign exchange fluctuations are major downsides.Over the past year, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has lost 50.1% compared with the 33.7% decline of the industry and 21.3% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned provider of POCs has a market capitalization of $471.9 million. The company projects 40.3% growth for 2023 and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. Inogen surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an earnings surprise of 90.5%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.High Prospects in the POC Space: We are optimistic about the POCs’ superiority over conventional oxygen therapy (known as the delivery model). POCs provide unlimited oxygen supply anywhere, thereby enhancing patient independence and mobility. Management at Inogen expects this to have an incremental positive impact on its industry and POC adoption.Product Portfolio: We are optimistic about Inogen’s expanding product portfolio. The company provides oxygen concentrator solutions for portable and stationary use. Notable products offered by the company include Inogen One G5 in the domestic business-to-business and direct-to-consumer channels, besides the Inogen One G3 and One G4 POC. Inogen At Home is aptly formulated for patients who need oxygen therapy during sleep.Management confirmed Inogen’s plan to incorporate the Tidal Assist Ventilator directly into the Inogen One Portable Oxygen Concentrators and make the SideKick TAV product compatible with the Inogen At-Home Stationary Concentrator.Strong Q2 Results: Inogen’s robust year-over-year uptick in overall and rental revenues in second-quarter 2022 buoy optimism. The strength in international business-to-business is encouraging. Inogen’s encouraging progress on its new commercial strategy for the prescriber channel raises our optimism. The continued strength across Inogen’s sales capabilities in the direct-to-consumer channel is also promising.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: The long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) market is a highly competitive industry. Inogen competes with a number of manufacturers and distributors of POC, as well as providers of other LTOT solutions such as home delivery of oxygen tanks or cylinders, stationary concentrators, transfilling concentrators and liquid oxygen. Given the relatively straightforward regulatory path in the oxygen therapy device manufacturing market, Inogen expects that the industry will become increasingly competitive in the future.Forex Woes: Inogen generates a significant portion of its revenues from the international market. Management expects international revenues to remain lumpy owing to the timing and size of the distributor.  It also expects adverse foreign currency exchange rates to impede revenue growth in the near term owing to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and other foreign currencies.Estimate TrendInogen has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2022. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has narrowed from $2.08 to $1.91.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $97.6 million, suggesting a 4.8% improvement from the year-ago reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN, ShockWave Medical, Inc. SWAV and McKesson Corporation MCK.AMN Healthcare, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 3.2%.

357,47a77788-13f4-3cef-9a7c-9a43dff2de17,MCK,2022-10-18,LabCorp (LH) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/labcorp-lh-report-q3-earnings-145502220.html,1666018502,STORY,"['LH', 'MCK', 'CRL', 'HUM']","[Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings LH, also known as LabCorp, is slated to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 27, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings of $4.96 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.2%. The company beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 16.96%.Factors at PlayLabCorp has been registering an ongoing sales rebound in the base business for both Diagnostics and Drug Development segments. However, as the severity of the pandemic has declined, we expect the demand for COVID-19 testing services and vaccines to have been lower than the year-ago period, impacting the third-quarter sales performance. Added to this, the ongoing inflationary pressure, a strengthening U.S. dollar and supply chain issues are expected to have adversely impacted LabCorp’s third-quarter performance. Going by the industry-wide trend so far, logistical challenges and increasing unit cost might have weighed on the corporate profitability of the company.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS SurpriseLaboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS SurpriseLaboratory Corporation of America Holdings price-eps-surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteThe company is positive about its new LaunchPad business process improvement initiative, which is anticipated to deliver $350 million in savings over the next three years. The new initiative is expected to have partially offset the company’s third-quarter margin erosion.Covance Drug Development is likely to have benefited in Q3 from continued growth in the organic base business and a strong backlog of $15.2 billion at the end of the second quarter. The company earlier expected approximately $4.8 billion of this backlog to convert into revenues over the next 12 months.However, similar to the last reported quarter, growth in early development and clinical development is expected to have been offset by central labs on account of a significant slowdown in COVID-related work and the Russia-Ukraine crisis. On a positive note, the company recently expanded its central labs kit production capabilities to improve delivery and address growing demand across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It announced the planned expansion of its central labs presence and drug development capabilities in Japan in collaboration with BML. Turning to oncology. the company continues to deepen its leadership position by expanding its cancer-related diagnostic screening and testing portfolio and by partnering with its pharmaceutical clients.Story continuesIn terms of monkeypox response, the company in collaboration with the CDC and FDA, has become the first national laboratory to begin testing for monkeypox using the CDC test. This should have contributed to the segment’s top line in Q3.Earlier in 2022, LabCorp and Walgreens announced the nationwide availability of Pixel by Labcorp COVID-19 at-home collection kit to allow greater access to reliable, convenient testing services within communities. These initiatives are likely to have made significant contributions to the company’s second-quarter performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Covance Drug Development segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.56 billion, indicating a rise of 6.6% from the prior-year quarter’s figure. Our model projects Q3 drug development revenues to be $1,54 billion, a 5.8% improvement year over year.Within LabCorp Diagnostics, base business organic volume is anticipated to have continued its rally, led by consistent growth in esoteric and routine procedures. However, a slowdown in COVID-19 testing is likely to have hampered sales performance within the segment. In this regard, in the second quarter, in terms of COVID-19 testing, rates dropped and LabCorp expected the decline to continue for the remainder of 2022. This is expected to get reflected in the company’s Q3 earnings release itself.In terms of base business, the company recently introduced multiple innovative and high-quality diagnostics to consumers and physicians. LabCorp also continued to expand its at-home test offerings through Labcorp OnDemand, including a first-of-kind blood collection device for diabetes risk screening. In addition, the company launched an FDA-approved men's rapid fertility test. For brain injuries and neurodegenerative disease, in July, the company was the first to begin offering a test that can help physicians diagnose conditions, including concussions, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. All these developments are expected to have contributed to the company’s Diagnostics arm in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LabCorp Diagnostics’ third-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.28 billion, implying a 13.1% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Key Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of $4.72 per share implies a 30.8% plunge from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.84 billion, suggesting a 5.5% fall from the prior-year reported number.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates.

ISRG is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 18, after the closing bell.The company’s stock has declined 49.1% so far this year compared with a decrease of 38.2% for the industry.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 1.72%. Its earnings beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, missed once and came in line once, the average surprise being 1.36%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ3 EstimatesCurrently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.52 billion, suggesting an improvement of 8.6% from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings stands at $1.10 per share, indicating a decline of 7.7% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteThe Instruments &amp; Accessories segment is likely to have witnessed a strong third quarter on the back of growth in da Vinci procedure volume as seen in the past two quarters. However, unfavorable currency movements and a resurgence in COVID-19 infections are likely to partially offset gains due to recovering demand in procedures. These effects are likely to be reflected in the third-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Instruments &amp; Accessories segment revenues stands at $873 million, suggesting growth of 13.1% year over year.Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci capital placements are likely to have been on the lower side due to lesser trade-in of systems (majority of U.S. customers have upgraded to newer generation systems), continued supply chain challenges impacting the availability of semiconductor components and growing capital spending pressure on hospitals amid rising inflationary pressure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of the da Vinci system in the United States is pegged at 177 units, suggesting 4.1% year-over-year growth.However, the company’s da Vinci capital placements have been benefiting from rising demand outside the United States. Intuitive Surgical placed 129 systems in the second quarter compared with 115 in the prior-year quarter in ex-U.S. markets. The trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter. The company expects the growth of the single port (SP) platform to have been driven by additional clinical indications and clearances in markets beyond the United States and Korea. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the sales of the da Vinci system outside the United States is 127 units, suggesting 28.3% year-over-year growth.Story continuesDuring the second quarter, the use of Intuitive Surgical’s digital product, Intuitive Hub, exhibited strong growth year over year. The company is in discussions with the FDA on how best to characterize some of its core artificial intelligence technology. It will continue to bring its flexible endoscopy platform Ion to scale and boost capacity, quality and cost improvements while seeking to expand access to new markets. These developments might have contributed to Intuitive Surgical’s third-quarter performance.ISRG’s new platforms made advancements in commercialization, innovation and clinical programs. This trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter as well. However, higher logistics costs during the reported quarter amid supply-chain challenges and rising inflationary pressure are likely to have driven expenses higher, hurting margins.Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

359,5933e6ec-938f-3884-bbcd-a8c17cd12560,TRV,2022-10-18,Earnings Preview: W.R. Berkley (WRB) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-w-r-berkley-140002940.html,1666015202,STORY,"['WRB', 'TRV']","[The market expects W.R. Berkley (WRB) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.82 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6.8%.Revenues are expected to be $2.72 billion, up 13% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.32% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for W.R. Berkley?For W.R. Berkley, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -6.22%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that W.R. Berkley will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that W.R. Berkley would post earnings of $0.84 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.12, delivering a surprise of +33.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.W.R. Berkley doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry, Travelers (TRV), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.77 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -31.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $9.17 billion, up 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Travelers has been revised 2.2% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -21.47%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Travelers will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

364,246b5f3d-7bb5-31a4-bb28-3417e1ac3f7a,FOX,2022-10-18,Fox (FOXA) and News Corp to Merge Under One Media Empire,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-foxa-news-corp-merge-164904832.html,1666025344,STORY,"['FOXA', 'NWSA']","[Fox Corporation’s FOXA founder Rupert Murdoch recently announced that the company is considering a merger with the media publishing company, News Corporation NWSA.Special board committees have been established by both companies and are at an initial stage of discussion to evaluate a possible deal and potential financial terms.A merger of the two companies would likely be structured as a stock deal. The exchange ratio reflecting the relative value of each company would be negotiated by the board committees of independent directors.What Does This Merger Bring to Fox?This merger of Fox Corporation and News Corporation would bring back high-profile business divisions under one roof after a split in 2013. Fox’s Fox News, Fox broadcast network, local TV stations and the Tubi streaming service would be combined with News Corp’s Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, as well as other assets including HarperCollins Publishers and news organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia.This would diversify and broaden the portfolio of Fox Corporation hence gaining traction with more customers and adding new sources of revenue to its top line.Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteThe publishing wing of Murdoch’s empire, News Corp has been performing better than expected. The Journal, part of its Dow Jones unit, enjoyed robust growth in its digital-subscription business over the past few years. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Digital-only subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products rose 9% year over year.The digital real-estate unit and book-publishing business also have propelled growth. Revenues in the Digital Real Estate Services segment increased 7% year over year to $443 million in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022.Fox’s driving engine has been Fox News with Fox News Channel once again closing August as the best-performing news brand for 18 consecutive months. Fox News usually attracts more prime-time audiences than its rivals and is competitive with the more widely distributed broadcast networks as well.Murdoch sees potential moneymaking and cost-saving opportunities in joining the two companies. The new company could look for ways to integrate its media properties. It could also explore ways to use the company’s assets for emerging business lines, such as sports betting, for which Fox has already laid a foundation by launching a sports-betting platform called Fox Bet along with the Stars Group in 2019.The merged companies could potentially save money by hiring one management team and maintaining one set of relationships with vendors, the people said.Story continuesThreats Attached to Proposed MergerHowever, this merger also brings some headwinds for Fox. Readers’ preference for accessing news online, mostly free, has made News Corporation’s print-advertising model increasingly redundant.Digital platforms, such as Meta Platform’s META Facebook, Twitter TWTR, Google and Amazon, which have higher mass penetration, audience data and targeting capabilities, may impact News Corporation’s share of the digital display advertising market.Meta benefits from increasing mobile ad revenues and growing adoption of stories by advertisers across Instagram. Twitter’s initiatives to add features and focus on effectively tackling abuse issues are helping it to expand the monetized user base, thereby driving ad revenues.A major portion of News Corporation’s total revenues is generated outside the United States. The ongoing foreign exchange fluctuation or the U.S. dollar gaining strength may hurt both the top and bottom lines of the company.Fox’s cable TV business also faces a serious threat from OTT platforms due to cord-cutting and changing consumer preferences. This does not bode well for Fox.In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Cable Network Programming EBITDA decreased 6.8% year over year to $628 million. The EBITDA margin contracted 520 bps to 43%.Fox, which currently has Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) declined 14.5% year to date against the Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector, which was down 41.7%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Lending will slow down quite a bit over the upcoming quarters, so a better reserve ratio would buttress them from a huge drop in demand.""Bank of NY Mellon Corp also benefited from higher rates, sending its shares up 5.64%.Overall, higher rates boosted interest incomes for lenders in the third quarter but turbulent markets choked off dealmaking and banks set aside more funds to brace for an economic slowdown.The S&amp;P 500 banks index was up 3.14%.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Cummins (NYSE:CMI) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Cummins is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$2.5b ÷ (US$24b - US$7.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Thus, Cummins has an ROCE of 15%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 10% generated by the Machinery industry. Check out our latest analysis for Cummins roceIn the above chart we have measured Cummins' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEThe trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has employed 48% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 15%. 15% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Cummins has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Our Take On Cummins' ROCETo sum it up, Cummins has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.Story continuesCummins does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Cummins  that you might be interested in.While Cummins may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings per share and revenues is pegged at $2 and $6.75 billion, respectively.For the current quarter, the consensus estimate for PACCAR’s earnings per share has remained constant in the past 30 days. Its bottom-line estimates imply growth of 85.2% from the year-ago reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly revenues suggests a year-over-year increase of 42.4%. Over the trailing four quarters, PACCAR surpassed earnings estimates on three occasions and missed once, with the average surprise being 7.44%. This is depicted in the graph below:PACCAR Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePACCAR Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePACCAR Inc. price-eps-surprise | PACCAR Inc. QuoteQ2 HighlightsPACCAR topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues in second-quarter 2022. Its adjusted earnings per share of $2.07 surpassed the consensus metric of $1.81 and rose 45.7% year over year. Higher-than-expected pretax income from the Trucks and Parts segments resulted in the outperformance.Earnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for the trucking giant for the quarter to be reported, as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: PACCAR has an Earnings ESP of +1.97%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged 4 cents higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: It currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors at PlayRobust demand from its Class 8 heavy-duty trucks is likely to have aided PACCAR’s trucking revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Leading brands, namely Kenworth, DAF and Peterbilt, are poised to drive the deliveries. The consensus mark for total truck deliveries is 46,498 units, increasing from 32,800 units reported in the prior-year quarter. As such, the consensus mark for revenues from the Truck segment is $5,316 million, rising from $3,453 million recorded in the previous-year quarter. The pretax profit estimate in the segment is $385 million, significantly up from $79 million reported in the year-ago period.The demand for aftermarket parts is on the rise, spurred by higher demand for environmentally sustainable vehicles. Owners are keen on adding modernized features to old cars, which is an important growth driver for PACCAR’s aftermarket parts segment. Continued growth in the aftermarket parts, which is a high margin and a less cyclic business, is likely to have aided the truck maker’s performance in the quarter to be reported.Encouragingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues from the Parts segment is pegged at $1,430 million, indicating a rise from $1,260 million recorded in the previous-year quarter. The estimate for pretax profit in the segment, pegged at $353 million, also suggests an increase from $281 million.On the flip side, the consensus mark for revenues from the Financial Services segment is $372 million, implying a fall from $409 million recorded in the previous-year quarter.Story continuesOther Stocks With Favorable CombinationLet’s take a look at some other players from the auto space, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat for the quarter to be reported:Oshkosh OSK will release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 27.

373,f1351de5-6f7a-3be3-aaaa-28aeda5f0c3d,DIS,2022-10-18,The Walt Disney Company's (NYSE:DIS) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 97% Above Its Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walt-disney-companys-nyse-dis-110036336.html,1666090836,STORY,['DIS'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney Is Walt Disney Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.64bUS$9.05bUS$11.6bUS$14.6bUS$16.8bUS$18.7bUS$20.3bUS$21.6bUS$22.7bUS$23.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x1Est @ 15.15%Est @ 11.2%Est @ 8.43%Est @ 6.5%Est @ 5.14%Est @ 4.19% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$6.2kUS$7.9kUS$9.5kUS$11.1kUS$12.0kUS$12.4kUS$12.6kUS$12.5kUS$12.3kUS$12.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$109bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$24b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.0%) = US$476bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$476b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$241bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$350b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$97.3, the company appears quite good value at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walt Disney as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.083. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

The report also showed he sold Nvidia call options bought in July 2021 for a loss of $361,476.The same report also shows Paul Pelosi exercised 200 call options to buy shares of Google-parent Alphabet in a transaction worth $2 million, while allowing call options in Walt Disney to expire for a loss of $132,824.All of those events occurred on Sept. 16, according to the transaction report.Paul Pelosi frequently trades shares of companies popular with many investors, including Apple, Microsoft and other tech companies.A 2012 law makes it illegal for lawmakers to use information from their work in Congress for their personal gain. The law requires them to disclose stock transactions by themselves or family members within 45 days.Senior House Democrats have yet to allow a vote on legislation restricting members of Congress and other government officials from trading stocks. Such legislation has been introduced in response to allegations that some lawmakers may have taken advantage of their positions for personal gain.Pelosi initially voiced skepticism of changes to the current law, but later allowed legislation to advance toward consideration by the chamber.In July, Paul Pelosi sold Nvidia shares days before the House approved legislation providing subsidies and tax credits worth over $70 billion to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry.An analysis by Unusual Whales, a service selling financial data, concluded that congressional lawmakers last year traded $290 million in stocks, options, cryptocurrency and other assets, and that they outperformed the market, on average.

These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Oneok Inc. is holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Story continuesValuation is also important, so investors should note that Oneok Inc. has a Forward P/E ratio of 14.58 right now. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 10.78.Also, we should mention that OKE has a PEG ratio of 1.93. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Oil and Gas - Production Pipeline - MLB stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.58 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Oil and Gas - Production Pipeline - MLB industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector.

(OKE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oneok-inc-oke-trending-stock-130001344.html,1666011601,STORY,['OKE'],"[Oneok Inc. (OKE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this natural gas company have returned -10.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Production Pipeline - MLB industry, to which Oneok belongs, has lost 7.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Oneok is expected to post earnings of $0.95 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.71 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.28 indicates a change of +15.4% from what Oneok is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Oneok.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OKE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Oneok, the consensus sales estimate of $6.73 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +48.3%. The $24.91 billion and $25.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +50.6% and +1.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOneok reported revenues of $6 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +77%. EPS of $0.92 for the same period compares with $0.77 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.37 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -5.81%. The EPS surprise was +9.52%.Over the last four quarters, Oneok surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Oneok is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Oneok. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

384,70738203-da2d-368b-b1fb-2c4f2e7a2b41,AKAM,2022-10-18,Techstrong Research Reveals Dual Focus for Enterprise Cloud Selection Criteria: Global Footprint and Developer Experience,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/techstrong-research-reveals-dual-focus-130300294.html,1666011780,STORY,['AKAM'],"[Buyers now place equal value on core cloud capabilities and the experience developers will have consuming cloud services.CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- More than 700 development professionals, managers and senior leaders across 20 industries participating in a study by Techstrong Research say that the cloud landscape is changing as buyers increasingly put the developer experience on the same footing as core technical and performance capabilities of cloud infrastructure services.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logo (PRNewsfoto/Akamai Technologies, Inc.)In the Techstrong Research report, ""Q3 2022 DevOps and the Public Cloud: The Move to the Distributed Cloud"", respondents focused on their eventual move to the distributed cloud as both a means to provide a global and scalable cloud platform as well as a developer-friendly environment that enables faster and cheaper application deployment than traditional hosting platforms. The report was commissioned by Akamai.Download the ReportDownload a copy of the Techstrong Research report here:https://www.linode.com/content/the-move-to-the-distributed-cloud-devops-public-cloud-research/The report underscores three major trends:First, as cloud consumption continues to scale, cloud platforms must have global reach, significant outbound network capacity, and high data security capabilities. Cloud buyers will consider multicloud architecture to reduce reliance on a specific cloud provider. Still, they need to do sufficient due diligence because migrating between cloud platforms is expensive and time-consuming. Price-performance is the top reason to consider adding another cloud provider, so cloud providers must be wary of saddling customers with an ever-expanding monthly cloud bill. Re-platforming is expensive, but so is staying on a cloud provider that doesn't aggressively follow the technology commodity curve.Second, the next battle in the cloud wars will be fought by cloud platforms striving to appeal to, and win the hearts of, developers. This constituency requires ease of use, simplicity, and programmability from the platforms where they deploy their applications. That makes developer support a huge factor in a cloud provider's ability to meet the needs of these teams as toolkits, APIs, easily integrated PaaS services, and a thriving ecosystem of pre-integrated third-party add-ons accelerate the developer's ability to deploy quickly and reliably. Technical support must be responsive and knowledgeable, as developers have little patience for infrastructure issues that hinder their ability to ship code.Story continuesFinally, these two trends will intersect as organizations increasingly look for a global cloud platform with sophisticated edge computing capabilities. Providers with these capabilities will need to control a large global network to cost-effectively deliver these services and a value-added set of application services to allow developers to deploy their applications as close to the users as possible.""The results of this study indicate that global, distributed edge cloud will favor a new class of cloud providers, to help organizations scale their application environments, support API-first software designs, facilitate integration with PaaS and third-party add-ons and assist customers in leveraging to modern deployment platform like Kubernetes,"" said Mike Rothman, General Manager of Techstrong Research. ""These distributed cloud providers go beyond the alternative clouds by having the scale and support to accelerate the migration to a global, cloud-native application environment without the complexity and cost of the legacy hyperscalers.""The research found that the key criteria for selecting cloud providers have remained consistent:DIY with control: Respondents want an easy-to-use, less complex environment that is secure and has the international security and compliance certifications to prove it. Security features accessible within applications remain the most important for organizations looking to switch cloud providers.Global scale with large outbound network capacity: As businesses have globalized, the expectation is that cloud platforms will offer connectivity regardless of geographic location and at sufficient scale to meet an application's peak usage  needs. Replatforming applications requires a significant investment to refactor the environment. Organizations are increasingly selecting their cloud providers based on their ability to meet their anticipated scale requirements.Developer-centric: As developers (and DevOps professionals) increasingly weigh in on platforming decisions, key capabilities like open infrastructure, programmable APIs and self-service capabilities via CLI or a web interface are becoming key requirements.Ability to distribute workloads to the edge: An emerging requirement, for sure, but bringing compute and data much closer to the ultimate consumer of applications will become increasingly important in a more remote and distributed world.In April, Techstrong Research released a report on alternative cloud usage. That report, also commissioned by Akamai, highlights trends around multicloud and cloud technology as a part of enterprise infrastructure. Approximately 75% of survey respondents say that their IT infrastructure will be cloud-based by the end of this year. This is a double-digit increase over what was reported in Techstrong's 2021 study. This continued and accelerating shift from on-premises to distributed, open, and heterogeneous environments is primarily driven by the need to add optionality and reduce costs, the survey found.""Enterprises are discovering that the developer experience is as pivotal to success in the cloud as are core elements like performance, security, cost, service and global footprint to the edge,"" said Blair Lyon, head of cloud experience at Akamai. ""The findings of this research echo what our customers are telling us more and more: a developer-centric experience is a necessary part of an enterprise cloud.""About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

Discover how leading ESG companies are incorporating ESG factors into their corporate strategy, achieving meaningful impact and communicating with their stakeholders.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has exposed how critical global health is to the fabric of society. The ability of the healthcare industry to mobilize and collaborate with regulators in order to develop and distribute vaccines to billions of people demonstrated its commitment to social impact and broader ESG commitments.Certara is a leading example of this. The life sciences company is on a mission to accelerate the development of new medicines to improve patient outcomes. Using biosimulation technology, Certara can speed up the drug development process, resulting in greater health impacts for more people.Nasdaq and Certara's shared commitment to positive social impact aligned last year when Certara listed on Nasdaq. Shortly after its IPO, Certara began working with Nasdaq's ESG Advisory practice to develop an ESG plan and effectively communicate its positive social impacts to key stakeholders.For this edition of ESG Trendsetters, Eric Vermeiren, Senior Specialist for Nasdaq ESG Advisory, spoke with William Feehery, Chief Executive Officer of Certara, to discuss how the company is innovating to improve the timeline of the drug development process to get crucial new therapies to patients who need it most. The following transcript of the conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.How do Certara's software and services positively impact patient outcomes?Our software and services are targeted toward improving the access and availability of critical medicines to patients worldwide. At the end of the day, we're focused on reducing the total cost of drug development, and there are three different ways to do so. You can reduce the time, increase the probability, or reduce the amount of money that has to be spent to get there. All three of them are valid, and our software and services are often doing one, two, or even all three for a number of our clients.Story continuesCould you discuss Project Optimus and its importance on clinical trials and patients?Project Optimus is a new initiative of the FDA, and the idea there is to determine the optimal dose of chemotherapy drug drugs for treating cancer. Up until now, what's happened is the FDA and drug companies have approved the maximum tolerated dose. So effectively, the maximum dose that won't kill the patient is thought to be the correct number to kill cancer. But, as oncology treatments have advanced, it's become necessary to think about this a little bit differently. So now, the FDA is pushing to have the optimal dose, meaning that more is not necessarily better. There's always a tradeoff between efficacy and safety. This new push for the FDA aims to get companies to determine what that optimal dose is. At Certara, that's a big thing for us because we do a lot of work using modeling and simulation to determine how drugs interact with the body. And one of the key questions that we're often called upon to answer is what is the correct dose? So we think that we're going to play a really important part in this as it goes forward.How do you continue to grow your expert team to fulfill your mission of accelerating medicines to patients?We think about it all the time, as we're trying to build a cutting-edge team for the type of science we do. We've attracted some of the best talent in the industry, but that's not enough. In order to retain and attract more talent, we need to have a culture of innovation. So we're always developing the next iteration in our technology. We have to work on hard and important problems. So we've got a lot of the world's drug development efforts going on right at this time in Certara, and that's an interesting challenge. We have a culture of collaboration, so you get to come here to work with other good scientists and work together. The last part is influence. Many of our scientists are very active at conferences, we publish hundreds of papers a year, and we're out there influencing the future direction the scientists are taking. When we get those things correct, we build a great team and continue to build Certara the way it is today.Nasdaq, Inc., Monday, October 17, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Nasdaq, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Nasdaq, Inc.Website: https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/corporate-esg-solutionsEmail: info@3blmedia.com SOURCE: Nasdaq, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/720720/ESG-Trendsetters-Certara]"

The report also showed he sold Nvidia call options bought in July 2021 for a loss of $361,476.The same report also shows Paul Pelosi exercised 200 call options to buy shares of Google-parent Alphabet in a transaction worth $2 million, while allowing call options in Walt Disney to expire for a loss of $132,824.All of those events occurred on Sept. 16, according to the transaction report.Paul Pelosi frequently trades shares of companies popular with many investors, including Apple, Microsoft and other tech companies.A 2012 law makes it illegal for lawmakers to use information from their work in Congress for their personal gain. The law requires them to disclose stock transactions by themselves or family members within 45 days.Senior House Democrats have yet to allow a vote on legislation restricting members of Congress and other government officials from trading stocks. Such legislation has been introduced in response to allegations that some lawmakers may have taken advantage of their positions for personal gain.Pelosi initially voiced skepticism of changes to the current law, but later allowed legislation to advance toward consideration by the chamber.In July, Paul Pelosi sold Nvidia shares days before the House approved legislation providing subsidies and tax credits worth over $70 billion to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry.An analysis by Unusual Whales, a service selling financial data, concluded that congressional lawmakers last year traded $290 million in stocks, options, cryptocurrency and other assets, and that they outperformed the market, on average.(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Josie Kao)]"

(MU): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-micron-technology-130001451.html,1666011601,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron (MU) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this chipmaker have returned -0.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, to which Micron belongs, has lost 0.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Micron is expected to post earnings of $0.04 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -98.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -108.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.17 points to a change of -98% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -105.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.63 indicates a change of +2,029.7% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -42.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Micron is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MU _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Micron, the consensus sales estimate of $4.27 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -44.5%. The $20.14 billion and $27.21 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -34.5% and +35.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $6.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.7%. EPS of $1.45 for the same period compares with $2.42 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -4.03%. The EPS surprise was +3.57%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Splunk SPLK, Fortinet FTNT, Palo Alto Networks PANW and Mettler-Toledo International MTD.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:4 Oversold Growth Tech Stocks to Buy Before They ReboundThe broader equity market has been highly volatile so far this year on increasing pessimism around the possibility of a recession amid rising interest rates, soaring inflation and supply-chain issues. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has further increased worries for investors about a global economic recovery.Technology is among the most-battered sectors amid the broader market sell-off this year so far. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Technology Select Sector Index, has lost approximately 32.8% of its value year to date (YTD). Also, the Nasdaq Composite index, which has the maximum weightage of tech stocks (approximately 50%) in its components, has plunged 34% YTD.However, this sell-off in the broader equity market has led to a massive correction in several technology companies’ stock prices, which were considered to be widely overvalued at the sector’s peak in 2021. With this correction, several tech stocks are currently trading way below their 52-week high and at attractive valuations as well, despite their strong fundamentals.In our opinion, Splunk, Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks and Mettler-Toledo International are among the most beaten-down stocks in the technology space. Given the strength of their fundamentals and solid prospects, it would be prudent move to add these stocks to your portfolio.Story continuesWhy Should You Bet on the Aforementioned Tech Stocks?Amid the financial instability, it is a prudent idea to pick solid growth companies as these are financially stable, accruing profits in established markets. These stocks, with their solid fundamentals, allow investors to hedge their funds from any economic downturn. Moreover, these fundamentally strong stocks are likely to outshine once the current macro headwinds subside and market sentiments improve.Apart from having solid fundamentals, the long-term earnings growth rate for the aforementioned stocks is more than 10%. These stocks also have a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).Per Zacks’ proprietary methodology, stocks with such a favorable combination offer solid investment opportunities.Additionally, these stocks are currently trading way below their 52-week high and are now available at attractive valuations.Our PicksSplunk– This San Francisco, CA-based company gains from strong execution across its platform, observability and security businesses as organizations partner with it to secure their infrastructure.Splunk’s software can be deployed in various computing environments, from a single laptop to large distributed data centers.

The integration with Amazon Web Services security hub to help customers accelerate their response to potential threats is a key catalyst.SPLK currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B. Shares of the company have plunged 39.3% YTD and currently trade 60.2% lower than its 52-week high of $176.66 attained on Nov 10, 2021.

The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has further increased worries for investors about a global economic recovery.Technology is among the most-battered sectors amid the broader market sell-off this year so far. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Technology Select Sector Index, has lost approximately 32.8% of its value year to date (YTD). Also, the Nasdaq Composite index, which has the maximum weightage of tech stocks (approximately 50%) in its components, has plunged 34% YTD.However, this sell-off in the broader equity market has led to a massive correction in several technology companies’ stock prices, which were considered to be widely overvalued at the sector’s peak in 2021. With this correction, several tech stocks are currently trading way below their 52-week high and at attractive valuations as well, despite their strong fundamentals.In our opinion, Splunk SPLK, Fortinet FTNT, Palo Alto Networks PANW and Mettler-Toledo International MTD are among the most beaten-down stocks in the technology space. Given the strength of their fundamentals and solid prospects, it would be prudent move to add these stocks to your portfolio.Why Should You Bet on the Aforementioned Tech Stocks?Amid the financial instability, it is a prudent idea to pick solid growth companies as these are financially stable, accruing profits in established markets. These stocks, with their solid fundamentals, allow investors to hedge their funds from any economic downturn. Moreover, these fundamentally strong stocks are likely to outshine once the current macro headwinds subside and market sentiments improve.Apart from having solid fundamentals, the long-term earnings growth rate for the aforementioned stocks is more than 10%. These stocks also have a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).Story continuesPer Zacks’ proprietary methodology, stocks with such a favorable combination offer solid investment opportunities.Additionally, these stocks are currently trading way below their 52-week high and are now available at attractive valuations.Our PicksSplunk – This San Francisco, CA-based company gains from strong execution across its platform, observability and security businesses as organizations partner with it to secure their infrastructure.Splunk’s software can be deployed in various computing environments, from a single laptop to large distributed data centers.

(NASDAQ: HAS), a global branded entertainment leader, today reported financial results for the third quarter 2022.Revenues of $1.68 billion were down 15% year-over-year, a decline of 12% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit of $194.3 million declined 47%, or 31% on an adjusted basis. These results were primarily impacted by the acceleration of Consumer Products shipments by our retailers into the second quarter due to anticipated supply chain challenges, as well as MAGIC: THE GATHERING set releases and entertainment content scheduled for release in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter last year.""As expected, the third quarter is our most difficult comparison and was further impacted by increasing price sensitivity for the average consumer,"" said Chris Cocks, Hasbro chief executive officer. ""To achieve our full-year outlook, we are projecting Hasbro’s fourth quarter revenue to be approximately flat versus last year on a constant currency basis with particular strength from our Wizards and Digital Gaming segment. Growth will be driven by what we expect to be one of the biggest fourth quarters for MAGIC: THE GATHERING as we kick off the brand’s 30th anniversary and celebrate Hasbro’s first ever $1 billion brand.""Cocks continued: ""Hasbro is well positioned for growth in 2023 and beyond as we execute our new strategic plan focused on bigger brands, stronger profits and consumer-focused leadership. We are committed to an industry-leading dividend and a 3-year program to drive $250-300 million per year in cost savings, including $50 million in annualized run-rate for year-end 2022. We have a strong line up of new products in Q4 and into next year, 7 new blockbuster films and 20+ streaming and TV shows that we are merchandising against starting with November’s Marvel Studios' Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and our Transformers: EarthSpark.""Story continues""In early October, we shared the results of our nine-month strategic review including our plan to drive accelerated growth and profit over the next five years,"" said Deborah Thomas, Hasbro chief financial officer.

These declines were partially offset by launch-related product development, advertising and depreciation costs associated with Dark Alliance that released in early third quarter 2021.For the full-year, on a constant currency basis, we expect high-single digit revenue growth behind a strong MAGIC: THE GATHERING tabletop release schedule for the fourth quarter. Operating profit margin is expected to be at or above 40%, down from 42.5% for full-year 2021, as we continue investing for long term growth in these valuable brands.Entertainment segment revenue decreased 35%.Revenues declined 34% excluding a negative $5.0 million impact of foreign exchange.Film &amp; TV revenue declined 26% reflecting the expected comparison to direct to streaming releases of the films Come from Away and Finch released in the prior period.Family Brands revenue declined 78% primarily due to the delivery of My Little Pony: A New Generation film in third quarter 2021 which did not have a comparable film release this year.Adjusted operating profit decreased 86% on lower revenues, in particular the decline in film revenue.For the full-year, on a constant currency basis and excluding the music business which was sold in 2021, we expect revenue to decline mid-single digits as we divest of certain non-core businesses, and some deliveries of scripted TV and film releases move to the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be approximately in line with or slightly up from last year's adjusted operating profit margin absent the music business of 7.8%.Third Quarter 2022 Brand Portfolio PerformanceBrand Performance ($ Millions)Net RevenuesQ3 2022Q3 2021% ChangeFranchise Brands1$814.1$925.1-12%Partner Brands$349.9$366.7-5%Hasbro Gaming2$211.3$281.9-25%Emerging Brands$123.4$134.4-8%TV/Film/Entertainment$177.2$261.9-32%1Effective in the first quarter of 2022, the Company moved PEPPA PIG into Franchise Brands from Emerging Brands. For comparability, third quarter 2021 net revenues have been restated to reflect the elevation of PEPPA PIG from Emerging Brands into Franchise Brands resulting in a change of $43.1 million.2Hasbro's total gaming category, including all gaming revenue, most notably MAGIC: THE GATHERING and MONOPOLY, totaled $508.6 million for the third quarter 2022, down 23% versus the third quarter 2021.Blueprint 2.0 &amp; Operational ExcellenceAt the Company's investor day on October 4, 2022, Hasbro unveiled its Blueprint 2.0. This new consumer-centric approach focuses on fewer, bigger brands, expanded licensing, branded entertainment, and driving high-margin growth in games, digital and direct.In support of the Blueprint 2.0, Hasbro announced an Operational Excellence program to deliver $250-300 million in annualized run-rate cost savings by year-end 2025. The Company expects cash costs of $200 million to implement the program, including an expected $20 million in 2022. A $55.3 million charge was recorded in the third quarter associated with the program primarily from a loss on assets held for sale as well as severance and other employee charges.Company OutlookThe Company's 2022 guidance includes:Full-year 2022 revenue flat to slightly down in constant currency16% adjusted operating profit margin, excluding Operational Excellence charge and other non-GAAP items(1)(1) The Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted operating profit margin measures because the Company cannot predict with certainty the timing and amounts of discrete items such as charges associated with its cost-savings program, which could impact GAAP results.Capital PrioritiesDuring the third quarter, Hasbro paid $96.7 million in cash dividends to shareholders. The next dividend of $0.70 per common share was previously declared and will be payable on November 15, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 1, 2022.Given the progress made toward reducing debt, the Company repurchased 1.4 million shares of Hasbro common stock at a total price of $125.0 million year-to-date 2022. $242.6 million remains available in the Company's share repurchase program. The Company remains on track to achieve its target gross debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.0 to 2.5X in the second half of 2023 or sooner, depending on business performance and other factors.Conference Call WebcastHasbro will webcast its third quarter 2022 earnings conference call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today.

We undertake no obligation to make any revisions to the forward-looking statements contained in this press release or to update them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this press release.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe financial tables accompanying this press release include non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules, specifically Adjusted operating profit, Adjusted net earnings and Adjusted net earnings per diluted share, which exclude, where applicable, acquisition and related costs, acquired intangible amortization, Operational Excellence charges as well as 2021 losses on the music sale and charges from UK tax reform. Also included in this press release are the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA represents net earnings attributable to Hasbro, Inc. excluding interest expense, income tax expense, net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Segment EBITDA represents segment operating profit (loss) plus other income or expense, less depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes Operational Excellence charges and the impact of stock compensation (including acquisition-related stock expense). As required by SEC rules, we have provided reconciliations on the attached schedules of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that Adjusted net earnings, Adjusted net earnings per diluted share and Adjusted operating profit provide investors with an understanding of the underlying performance of our business absent unusual events. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate measures for evaluating the operating performance of our business because they reflect the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, to invest in the business, strengthen the balance sheet and make strategic acquisitions. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the consolidated statements of operations is quantified by translating the current period revenues at the prior period exchange rates and comparing this amount to the prior period reported revenues. The Company believes that the presentation of the impact of changes in exchange rates, which are beyond the Company’s control, is helpful to an investor’s understanding of the performance of the underlying business. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net earnings or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP as more fully discussed in our consolidated financial statements and filings with the SEC. As used herein, ""GAAP"" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.HAS-E(Tables Attached)HASBRO, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(Unaudited)(Millions of Dollars)September 25,2022September 26,2021ASSETSCash and Cash Equivalents$551.6$1,181.2Accounts Receivable, Net1,188.81,476.6Inventories844.5544.1Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets658.8528.5Assets Held for Sale16.8—Total Current Assets3,260.53,730.4Property, Plant and Equipment, Net411.8441.9Goodwill3,469.83,420.2Other Intangible Assets, Net1,079.71,209.5Other Assets1,404.31,428.4Total Assets$9,626.1$10,230.4LIABILITIES, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITYShort-Term Borrowings$122.3$0.9Current Portion of Long-Term Debt122.6187.6Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities2,097.02,261.9Liabilities Held for Sale15.0—Total Current Liabilities2,356.92,450.4Long-Term Debt3,725.13,977.4Other Liabilities545.1722.5Total Liabilities6,627.17,150.3Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests—22.9Total Shareholders' Equity2,999.03,057.2Total Liabilities, Noncontrolling Interests and Shareholders' Equity$9,626.1$10,230.4HASBRO, INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(Unaudited)(Millions of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)Quarter EndedNine Months EndedSeptember25, 2022% NetRevenuesSeptember26, 2021% NetRevenuesSeptember25, 2022% NetRevenuesSeptember26, 2021% NetRevenuesNet Revenues$1,675.9100.0%$1,970.0100.0%$4,178.2100.0%$4,407.0100.0%Costs and Expenses:Cost of Sales586.635.0%609.530.9%1,331.231.9%1,244.428.2%Program Cost Amortization146.58.7%187.99.5%365.78.8%396.19.0%Royalties135.18.1%171.88.7%335.38.0%392.28.9%Product Development82.44.9%80.14.1%231.25.5%229.15.2%Advertising115.26.9%163.38.3%277.06.6%356.68.1%Amortization of Intangibles26.91.6%27.71.4%81.21.9%90.32.0%Selling, Distribution and Administration365.821.8%361.818.4%1,000.123.9%1,004.722.8%Loss on Assets Held for Sale23.11.4%—0.0%23.10.6%—0.0%Loss on Disposal of Business—0.0%—0.0%—0.0%101.82.3%Operating Profit194.311.6%367.918.7%533.412.8%591.813.4%Interest Expense41.92.5%43.32.2%125.23.0%137.33.1%Other Expense (Income), Net(13.2)-0.8%1.20.1%(17.5)-0.4%(39.5)-0.9%Earnings before Income Taxes165.69.9%323.416.4%425.710.2%494.011.2%Income Tax Expense37.42.2%68.53.5%94.12.3%143.53.3%Net Earnings128.27.6%254.912.9%331.67.9%350.58.0%Net Earnings (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests(1.0)-0.1%1.70.1%(0.8)0.0%4.00.1%Net Earnings Attributable to Hasbro, Inc.$129.27.7%$253.212.9%$332.48.0%$346.57.9%...]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Mueffling's investment philosophy and performance, go directly to Top 5 Stock Picks of William Von Mueffling's Cantillon Capital Management.William Von Mueffling worked at Lazard Asset Management before launching Cantillon Capital Management in 2003. He rose to fame while at Lazard Asset Management by posting 30% annualized returns during 1998-2003. That level of return during the extended market turmoil was made possible through timely short positions on several Internet high-fliers. Currently, he is the CEO and CIO of Cantillon Capital Management, an investment firm with more than $14 billion in assets under management.Mueffling used a traditional long/short strategy when he started Cantillon Capital Management. However, the hedge fund saw net withdrawals in 2008 as its funds experienced a loss. To everyone's surprise, he gave up shorting as an investment strategy the following year, highlighting how difficult it was to short when the government was creating money. Mueffling beat several other hedge funds, although his gains were still relatively small when assessed in terms of absolute returns. His hedge fund dropped 7%-8% up until May 2009.According to a Wall Street Journal story from 2010, Cantillon Capital Management's strategy is to look for businesses that deliver above-average returns on shareholder equity but are properly valued in relation to their income streams. Additionally, Mueffling stated in an interview with Graham &amp; Doddsville, the Columbia Business School newsletter:“One can broadly divide value investing into two camps. The first camp is the Graham &amp; Dodd style which is buying assets at a discount or cash at a discount. The second camp is the Buffett style, which I characterize as buying financial productivity at a discount. We fall into the second camp. We believe that there are many different types of moats to be found, and that a moat around a business should allow it to produce outsized margins and wonderful returns on capital. The trick is being able to buy this stream of cash flows at a discount. Unlike Graham &amp; Dodd investing where you might look at low price-to-book value companies or net-net companies, we are trying to buy high financial productivity at a discount to its intrinsic value.”Story continuesTop 10 Stock Picks of William von Mueffling's Cantillon Capital ManagementWilliam Von Mueffling of Cantillon Capital ManagementCantillon Capital Management announced 39 portfolio changes in the second quarter of 2022.

The business itself has been relatively durable, but the stock certainly has not. While the core elements of our bullish thesis remain firmly intact, hindsight tells us that we could have waited for a better entry point.

(NYSE:V)Cantillon Capital Management’s Stake Value: $453,111,000 Percentage of Cantillon Capital Management’s 13F Portfolio: 3.78% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 166Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a company that provides digital payment services. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) Canada and TD Securities launched innovative cooperation on October 6 as the first financial institution in Canada to join Visa B2B Connect, a cross-border business-to-business (B2B) payments network that enables account-to-account international transfers rapidly, securely, and reliably.On August 16, Daiwa analyst Kazuya Nishimura downgraded Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) from ‘Outperform’ to ‘Neutral’ and trimmed his price objective on the shares from $230 to $225. Border restrictions have almost all vanished in recent years, except for some parts of Asia.

(NYSE:V) and discussed its stance on the firm. Here is what the fund said:“It was business as usual for Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) as it delivered another solid quarter driven by strong US growth, the ongoing gradual displacement of cash with digital transactions, and accelerated growth in cross-border volume as travel spending plays catch up post-Covid. Visa processed 49.3 billion transactions on its network, up 16% year-on-year and 39% above pre-pandemic levels, driving $2.7 trillion in total payments volume, both of which have more than recovered from the impacts of the pandemic. The total number of cards in Visa’s network also grew by 8% year-on-year to 3.9 billion.Cross-border transactions were a key issue for Visa during the pandemic, but this headwind has now turned into a tailwind. Constant currency cross-border volumes rose 40% (48% excluding intra-Europe) in the most recent quarter and we expect this trend will continue to play out in the year ahead. While a potential economic slowdown and geopolitical concerns are always a risk, we take comfort in the fact that Visa has a sixty-plus year track record of successfully overcoming numerous macroeconomic challenges that in the moment appeared insurmountable. We believe this current episode will prove no different and that the combination of a very attractive industry structure and the ongoing secular shift towards digital payments provides a foundation that will enable Visa to continue winning for many years to come.”6.

So there there is legislation that has the potential to take the hourly wage up to $21, $22 an hour that will put organizations in a place where prices probably have to rise. It's unfortunate because it also impacts the economic model, and that could impact how many restaurants we open in the future in a state like California which is a shame,"" Niccol said at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit on Monday.People are served in a Chipotle outlet in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., February 7, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew KellyAbout 15% of Chipotle's 3,000 plus locations in the U.S. are located in California.In early September, Newsom signed into law a bill establishing a ""Fast Food Council."" The 10-member council will set standards for pay, hours and working conditions for fast-food workers in the Golden State. If the referendum receives roughly 623,000 signatures by the first week of December, the measure will appear on the November 2024 California ballot.The legislation could pave the way for raising the minimum wage for fast food workers to $22 an hour for employers with more than 26 workers. Currently, the minimum wage stands at $15 in the state.""Equitable? You signed a bill from the hills of Napa that singles out franchise owners with new rules and costs to appease your biggest campaign donors; will raise prices on lower income Californians and will accelerate business leaving the state,"" tweeted the CEO of the International Franchise Association Matt Haller to Newsom.Niccol predicts any changes to the industry that come as a result of the Fast Food Council will ultimately backfire on Newsom.""The brand is loved in California and the employees love working there, and the customers love getting our food.

(NYSE:PLD) stock at high prices would have gotten insiders a handsome reward",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/selling-us-54m-worth-prologis-110029101.html,1666090829,STORY,['PLD'],"[Even though Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) stock gained 6.4% last week, insiders who sold US$54m worth of stock over the past year are probably better off. Selling at an average price of US$147, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best move for these insiders because their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Prologis The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PrologisIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Co-Founder, Hamid Moghadam, sold US$46m worth of shares at a price of US$145 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$105). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.All up, insiders sold more shares in Prologis than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that Prologis insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$97m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Prologis Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Prologis shares in the last quarter. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by Prologis insiders. But it's good to see that insiders own shares in the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Prologis you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit unpleasant.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

To ignore our industry introduction, and to jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, head on over to 5 Technology Stocks To Buy That Are Too Cheap To Ignore. Taking a look at the broad stock market, which consists of a myriad of sectors such as construction, industrial, agriculture, and furniture, one of the strongest growing sectors is technology. Spurred by the advances in chip fabrication, today's computing devices are vastly more powerful than those just two decades back. These have driven a variety of technology industries, ranging from enterprise computing to the metaverse.For investors looking to profit from this growth, this year's stock market bloodbath spurred by rapid interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve can provide the perfect opportunity to buy shares. This is simply due to the fact that the share prices that have dropped are due to the general macroeconomic environment and not because of underlying problems with the companies themselves.The trend in technology stocks can be explained better by no one other than the billionaire Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments. The investor recently outlined that:. . .that means when we get to the bottom whenever that is, you should expect to see tech, because it's been lagging, because we've had more down days than up this year, which you know by definition since we've had a down year in 2022 through the middle of the summer. You should expect to see it leading once we hit that bear market bottom and start on the other side. Now I don't want to argue with you in this video about direction of the market, I do want to say once you get down this far into a bear market, it is not terribly long in time until you normally get to a bottom. We can debate what that is, but once you get into the bottom, you should see tech leading for about the next year. And therefore, and maybe longer, but for about the next year. And therefore, we should be seeing most of the next year led by tech going up. I want to step back and reiterate, market down, tech down more. Market up, tech up more. Correlation to that is so high and yet not widely perceived by people. I've not seen anything stated on this in public anywhere, but it's a simple, unseen fact. And facts are stubborn things. And the stubbornness of that ripples over into this feature, that I just articulated. As categories, not individual stocks, categories. Falls the most in bear markets, bounces the most for a good long time coming off the bottom. And you should expect that with tech as we hit a bottom, when we hit a bottom.Story continuesBuilding upon Mr. Fisher's thoughts, research firm Research and Markets believes that the global information technology market was worth $7.8 trillion in 2020, and despite this size, it will still grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 9% to sit at a whopping $11 trillion in 2025.Today's piece will focus on the cheap technology stocks that are easy to invest in, and some companies likely to catch your attention include Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Mid-Cap Stocks To Buy Now.Mid-cap stocks may be thought of as the ""sweet spot"" between the rampant volatility of small-caps and the stability of large-caps. According to data from Alger, mid-cap stocks have outperformed both small-cap and large-cap stakes based on risk-adjusted returns. Between 1990 and 2020, the Sharpe ratio, a measure of performance relative to risk, for mid-cap stocks was higher than that of both small-cap and large-cap stocks. Mid-cap stocks had a Sharpe ratio of 0.60, while small-caps had a Sharpe ratio of 0.44, and large-caps had a Sharpe ratio of 0.56. Alger researchers also pointed out that mid-cap stocks account for roughly 20% of the U.S. stock market and just 11% of U.S. mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This finding suggests that a lot of mid-cap companies are overlooked by the market, and investors can unlock new value in these neglected spaces.Finding good quality companies that are overlooked by the market is a challenge. Thomas Cole, CFA and co-founder of Chicago-based investment advisory firm, Distillate Capital LLC, appeared in an interview on TD Ameritrade where he talked about his company's small- and mid-cap equity fund and what approach are they using at Distillate Capital. Thomas Cole said that his strategy is to ""focus on free cash flow"" and that he looks for ""better stability and better quality combined with better valuation"" which is measured on the basis of free cash flow.Some of the best profitable and cash-rich mid-cap stocks that are on investors' and analysts' watch lists right now include Kohl's Corporation (NYSE:KSS), Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLDR), and Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA).

Nike continues to place a greater focus on their Direct-to-Consumer business, which will decrease their contribution to Foot Locker’s total sales, retreating to historical averages of 50% by 2023. While a near-term headwind to sales, management plans to offset the lost business by expanding distribution to other leading brands, rolling out larger neighborhood free-standing stores, and expanding two new growth banners (WSS &amp; Atmos). WSS stores will provide an off-mall presence and focus on the rapidly growing and underserved Hispanic market. Atmos will provide Foot Locker with the ability to expand into Japan and Asia sneaker market with their digitally led business model. These new growth concepts have a combined potential to add more than $1B in sales by 2024. The company’s balance sheet remains very strong with $800M in cash and management is increasing returns to shareholders through raising the dividend by 40% and announcing a $1.2B share buyback (more than 40% of the float at current share prices).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings per share and revenues is pegged at $2 and $6.75 billion, respectively.For the current quarter, the consensus estimate for PACCAR’s earnings per share has remained constant in the past 30 days. Its bottom-line estimates imply growth of 85.2% from the year-ago reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly revenues suggests a year-over-year increase of 42.4%. Over the trailing four quarters, PACCAR surpassed earnings estimates on three occasions and missed once, with the average surprise being 7.44%. This is depicted in the graph below:PACCAR Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePACCAR Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePACCAR Inc. price-eps-surprise | PACCAR Inc. QuoteQ2 HighlightsPACCAR topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues in second-quarter 2022. Its adjusted earnings per share of $2.07 surpassed the consensus metric of $1.81 and rose 45.7% year over year. Higher-than-expected pretax income from the Trucks and Parts segments resulted in the outperformance.Earnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for the trucking giant for the quarter to be reported, as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: PACCAR has an Earnings ESP of +1.97%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged 4 cents higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: It currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors at PlayRobust demand from its Class 8 heavy-duty trucks is likely to have aided PACCAR’s trucking revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Leading brands, namely Kenworth, DAF and Peterbilt, are poised to drive the deliveries. The consensus mark for total truck deliveries is 46,498 units, increasing from 32,800 units reported in the prior-year quarter. As such, the consensus mark for revenues from the Truck segment is $5,316 million, rising from $3,453 million recorded in the previous-year quarter. The pretax profit estimate in the segment is $385 million, significantly up from $79 million reported in the year-ago period.The demand for aftermarket parts is on the rise, spurred by higher demand for environmentally sustainable vehicles. Owners are keen on adding modernized features to old cars, which is an important growth driver for PACCAR’s aftermarket parts segment. Continued growth in the aftermarket parts, which is a high margin and a less cyclic business, is likely to have aided the truck maker’s performance in the quarter to be reported.Encouragingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues from the Parts segment is pegged at $1,430 million, indicating a rise from $1,260 million recorded in the previous-year quarter. The estimate for pretax profit in the segment, pegged at $353 million, also suggests an increase from $281 million.On the flip side, the consensus mark for revenues from the Financial Services segment is $372 million, implying a fall from $409 million recorded in the previous-year quarter.Story continuesOther Stocks With Favorable CombinationLet’s take a look at some other players from the auto space, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat for the quarter to be reported:Oshkosh OSK will release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 27.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report.

Rowe PriceT. Rowe Price, Tuesday, October 18, 2022, Press release pictureJulie Lewis is the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) manager at T. Rowe Price. She is a human resources professional and neurodiversity advocate who has been with the firm for more than 25 years.\My first job as a teenager was working at The Cosmetic Center. It was like a supermarket of makeup and other beauty products. I initially was motivated to take the job by two things: the opportunity to make money for all the car-related expenses that go along with getting your driver's license and an employee discount on electric blue mascara, which was having a moment in the mid-1980s.While I took the job for a paycheck and the employee discount, I found additional rewards in the experience. I learned all the great lessons that work can teach you: what it is like to be part of a team, the importance of being responsible and following through on your commitments, problem-solving, how to respond professionally and appropriately to an angry customer, and more.Since then, I've come to realize that working gives us more than just the means to pay our bills or support our family. It gives us a feeling of personal fulfillment and connection to others and offers opportunities to learn and grow. Holding a job also gives you feelings of independence and pride.October 2022 marks the 77th anniversary of National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM). The goal of NDEAM is to raise awareness about disability employment issues while celebrating the contributions of workers with disabilities.Why is disability employment awareness important? Because 15% of the world's population, or an estimated one billion people, live with disabilities. While this is a significant population, it is a marginalized one. In developing countries, 80% to 90% of people of working age with disabilities are unemployed, whereas in industrialized countries, the figure is between 50% and 70%.Story continuesPeople with disabilities can face unique barriers to gaining and keeping employment. Accessibility challenges during the job search and interview processes can prevent people with disabilities from even getting their foot in the door with an employer.Once employed, lack of accommodations, lack of understanding, and bias can become barriers to a person with a disability remaining employed. For example, challenges that can be easily remedied through reasonable accommodation are sometimes labeled as ""performance problems"" that lead to an employee with a disability losing employment or finding themselves given corrective action (limiting their advancement prospects).NDEAM is an opportunity to consider how to be more inclusive in the workplace so all associates can contribute and be a meaningful part of the work we do.T. Rowe Price recently began a partnership with Disability:IN, an organization that expands opportunities for people with disabilities across enterprises through its network of more than 400 corporations.In addition to celebrating NDEAM with a special event, T. Rowe Price launched a neurodiversity working group to increase and expand its knowledge and awareness about neurodiversity and disability inclusion, to assess its existing accommodations and processes, and to educate leaders on hiring neurodiverse talent. I'm excited to be a part of this work and look forward to seeing how it's integrated into our larger DEI strategy.As we celebrate NDEAM and other celebrations of diversity, I invite you to learn more about T.

To tame the sky-high inflation in the United States, the Fed adopted a hawkish stance. Per the latest available data, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation for September 2022 was up 8.2% year over year. As a result of the higher-than-expected reading, the Fed, which already raised its core interest rate 3% year to date, is likely to continue its interest-raising policy in its future meetings this year.  Higher interest rates result in the cost of borrowing moving north, thus escalating the chances of an economic slowdown.This gloomy scenario and the uncertain path ahead are well reflected in the 19%, 34.81% and 25.4% year-to-date declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq composite and S&amp;P 500 indexes, respectively. Despite the current turmoil, shunning equities is never advisable for investors. So what’s the way forward?One way forward could be keeping tabs on blue-chip stocks, as they are financially sound and resilient to market swings. We apply this logic to the widely-diversified Zacks Transportation sector, the focus of this write-up. Industry heavyweights like United Parcel Service UPS, Union Pacific Corporation UNP and Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC clearly fit the bill and should be on an investor’s watch list.Tailwinds in the Transportation SectorEven though headwinds like the above-mentioned inflation-induced market volatility, supply-chain woes and high-fuel costs dented the prospects of the Transportation sector, inducing its 24.9% year-to-date decline, it is heartening to note that sector participants are surrounded by some positives.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOwing to the uptick in economic activities, freight demand continues to be strong despite minor hiccups. This is supporting growth for the transportation players like railroad operators. The Cass Freight shipments Index improved 4.8% year over year in September. The overall improving trend is evident from the fact that the measure has improved year over year in five (February, March, July, August and September) of the nine months reported so far this year.Story continuesWith people resuming their daily activities, following the relaxation of COVID-related restrictions, air-travel demand rebounded very strongly. This is good news for the airline companies in the sector. Even though economies are reopening, consumers’ urge for online shopping refuses to relent. This continued strength in e-commerce demand bodes well for companies like UPS.Transportation Stocks to WatchGiven the above tailwinds surrounding the sector, investors should keep tabs on stocks from this key field. To aid their search, we shortlisted three heavyweight stocks, which are financially mature and have large market capitalizations (above $50 billion).Moreover, these stocks boast a solid dividend-paying history. This adds to their appeal, especially in uncertain times as the present-day scenario.

These are companies that growth revenue and, or profits at a faster rate than the broader market. At the same time, they provide dividend payments, enabling a best-of-both-worlds.As for ultimate growth potential, these under the radar dividend growth stocks may have the potential to create double-digit gains over the next year or two. Some market ideas might take a bit longer than others, simply based on their underlying industry. Nevertheless, these ideas bring balance to the table. If you don’t know what direction to go, grab both capital gains and income with these under the radar dividend growth stocks.WSOWatsco$241.47AOSA.O. Smith$49.04TXNTexas Instruments$148.34INFYInfosys$17.81SPNSSapiens International$18.42MGRCMcGrath RentCorp$83.65UPSUnited Parcel Service$161.68Watsco (WSO)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comBilled as the largest distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment, Watsco (NYSE:WSO) provides everyday relevance for millions of households. Unfortunately, this narrative hasn’t helped WSO much, with shares dropping almost 16% on a year-to-date basis. Still, this company which usually lurks in the shadows makes for one of the best under the radar dividend growth stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFirst, let’s talk about the passive income. According to Dividend.com, WSO features a forward yield of 3.43%. This compares favorably to the Dow Jones Industrials average yield of 2.12%. Moreover, Watsco has nine years of consecutive dividend increases. Second, the financials really shine for Watsco. Owning robust strengths across the board, the company has higher-than-average performance stats for revenue expansion and profitability. Plus, the industrial equipment and products firm has a return on equity of 27.3%. This compares favorably to nearly 88% of the competition, making WSO a high-quality business.Story continuesLooking ahead, WSO should easily move 10% higher from the current price over the next two years.A.O. Smith (AOS)A photo of small bubbles in a container of water.Source: khak/ShutterStock.comA.O. Smith (NYSE:AOS) enjoys a reputation as one of the world’s leading providers of water heating and water treatment solutions. Given the pertinence of its underlying business, A.O. Smith benefits from some magnitude of inelastic demand. Still, this framework has not been beneficial for AOS stock, which slipped over 41% since the start of this year.Nevertheless, AOS may qualify for one of the best under the radar dividend growth stocks to buy, at least for patient investors. First, A.O. Smith features a forward yield of 2.29%. To be fair, this metric slips slightly lower than the Industrials average yield of 2.12%. However, the company enjoys 30 years of consecutive dividend increases. That’s certainly not a status A.O. Smith will give up without a fight.On the financials, the company enjoys strong growth and earnings trajectories. For instance, its three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate stands at 18.4%, ranking better than nearly 65% of the competition. Even better, A.O. Smith has a return on equity of 28%, reflecting a high-quality business (like Watsco above).Moving forward, AOS easily has the potential to rise 10% quickly should economic conditions normalize.Texas Instruments (TXN)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally. Unfortunately, the global supply chain disruption, stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, meant that TXN struggled this year. Still, it’s not a horrific outing for Texas Instruments, with shares down 19% YTD.If you can overlook the double-digit losses, which again isn’t that bad compared to the Nasdaq Composite’s performance, you might come away with the impression that TXN represents one of the under-the-radar dividend growth stocks to buy. First, the company carries a forward yield of 3.2%. This contrasts favorably with the technology sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, TXN enjoys 18 years of consecutive dividend increases.What’s more, Texas Instruments features myriad financial strengths across the board. Along with solid growth and excellent profitability metrics when stacked up against the semiconductor industry, TXN’s return on equity pings at 66%. That’s above nearly 99% of its peers, reflecting incredible quality.Once circumstances normalize, you’re looking at TXN being up 20% from here easily and quickly.Infosys (INFY)Source: ShutterstockInfosys (NYSE:INFY) provides business consulting, information technology and outsourcing services. Further, the underlying region represents a major growth market. Experts project that the Indian economy will expand at an average real GDP growth rate of 6% between 2022 and 2030. Sadly, this compelling potential fails to convince Wall Street. Since the beginning of this year, INFY fell over 28%.Still, investors with a long-term view should consider INFY as one of the under-the-radar dividend growth stocks to buy. On the passive income side, Infosys carries a forward yield of 2.25%. Though not the highest figure in town, it does rank better than the tech sector’s average yield. At the same time, Infosys doesn’t have a long track record of consecutive dividend increases so it’s something to note.On the financials, it’s tough to beat Infosys. No matter where you look (balance sheet, revenue trajectories, earnings performances) INFY simply features a stacked profile. Significantly, the company has a return on equity of 31%, reflect top-notch business quality.If you believe in the India upside narrative, INFY could be good for a 20% jump in two years’ time.Sapiens International (SPNS)software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecuritySource: ShutterstockSapiens International (NASDAQ:SPNS) develops computer software for the insurance industry. One of the fundamental drivers for SPNS is that generally speaking, insurance providers feature inelastic demand. No matter what’s going on with the economy, people need financial protection. However, as with other under-the-radar dividend growth stocks, the business narrative hasn’t helped in 2022.SPNS shares fell a staggering 48%. Further, volatility has yet to die down, with the security declining over 11% in the trailing month. That said, Sapiens has a forward yield of 2.56%. Again, that’s conspicuously above the technology sector’s average yield of 1.37%. To be fair, though, the company only has two years of consecutive dividend increases.For those looking for a great deal, Gurufocus.com labels SPNS significantly undervalued. It’s the same story with the other under-the-radar dividend growth stocks on this list. Sapiens benefits from above-sector-average growth and profitability metrics. Plus, the company features a return on equity of 13.4%, a very solid figure representing a quality business.Certainly, SPNS requires some broader market stabilization. Once that happens, SPNS could easily fly higher 10% to 20%, if not more.McGrath RentCorp (MGRC)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockMcGrath RentCorp (NASDAQ:MGRC) represents a diversified business-to-business rental company. Primarily, the company rents and sells relocatable modular buildings, storage containers and offices, electronic test equipment, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Featuring everyday commercial relevance, Wall Street finally rewarded one of these under-the-radar dividend growth stocks. Since the start of this year, MGRC gained 6%.The hope here is that shares continue to rise steadily higher. Fundamentally, it can achieve this goal because of its 2.15% forward yield. No, it’s not the most generous yield. It’s even well below the real estate average yield of 4.46%. However, McGrath also brings the growth component to the mix, facilitating balanced reassurances for prospective stakeholders.Now, about that growth. Data from Gurufocus.com reveals that McGrath’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 7.4%. Further, its three-year book growth rate is 8.5%. Both rank better than at least 60% of the competition. As well, the company’s return on equity pings at 13.3%, superior to 64% of the industry.Looking ahead, MGRC is a bit of a slower mover in the market. However, the combo of growth and yield make it one of the better names among under-the-radar dividend growth stocks.United Parcel Service (UPS)Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.Source: monticello / ShutterstockUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) long represented a vital cog in the global supply chain network. Sadly, though, this very narrative presents significant risks to the courier service. With a major rival recently disclosing negative impacts from macroeconomic headwinds, it’s possible that UPS could succumb to similar pressures.For now, the company is doing its best to hold on, although shares did slip over 23% since the start of the year. Nevertheless, for those that are willing to take risks, UPS may offer an enticing profile among under-the-radar dividend growth stocks. Per Dividend.com, the company offers a forward yield of 3.72%. That’s higher than the broader Industrials average yield of 2.12%.Despite wider fundamental concerns, UPS enjoys overall strong financials. For instance, the company’s three-year book growth rate stands at 66.9%, better than nearly 98% of the competition. As well, UPS has a return on equity of 79.5%, ranked better than 96% of its peers.Predicting chart growth presents vagaries since UPS ties in with macro dynamics. Still, if circumstances normalize, it should be good for at least 10% growth in the next year or two.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for American Express The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At American ExpressThe Chairman &amp; CEO, Stephen Squeri, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$8.6m worth of shares at a price of US$178 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$142. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last year American Express insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that American Express insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$117m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At American Express Tell Us?The fact that there have been no American Express insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of American Express insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that American Express has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.Of course American Express may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

431,218a8d3d-fcd7-3fdf-a795-61e1db5b02d7,AXP,2022-10-18,Pre-Markets Up to Start a New Week,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pre-markets-start-week-143302702.html,1666017182,STORY,"['JNJ', 'AXP', 'BAC']","[Monday, October 17, 2022Ahead of this holiday season, market participants gather for a long feast — Q3 earnings season is now underway, with a full compliment of industries represented by some key publicly traded leaders. Aside from the Wall Street banks we’re seeing report this morning, this week brings us results from Netflix NFLX, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, Tesla TSLA, IBM IBM, American Airlines AAL, American Express AXP and Verizon VZ.This morning, we also see a new Empire State Manufacturing Survey for October, which brings us the seventh down month in the first 10 of the year: -9.1 is below the -5.0 expected and the -1.5 posted for September. While not good if we’re looking for productivity growth in New York state, it’s well off the pace of -31.3 we saw just in August, which was the deepest sink on this data since the early months of the pandemic. Then again, for most of 2021, we were between +20 and +40 on the Empire State Index.In other economic data, Tuesday brings us Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, Wednesday is Housing Starts and Building Permits, as well as a new Beige Book. Thursday offers weekly Jobless Claims, the Philly Fed survey and Existing Home Sales. None of these reports in and of themselves will have a chance to change the Fed’s notion that another 75 basis-point (bps) interest rate hike is in the cards for November 2nd (the next Fed meeting), but cumulatively they may add a new angle to the discussion.Bank of America BAC reported Q3 earnings ahead of today’s opening bell, beating on earnings by 2 cents per share to 81 cents, while revenues of $24.61 billion surpassed expectations by a cool billion dollars. Net interest income gained +24% in the quarter, while Fixed Income was +27%. Shares are up +3% on the news.Bank of New York - Mellon BK also reported positive surprises for its Q3 this morning, with earnings of $1.21 per share beating the +1.10 expected, +11% year over year. Revenues in the quarter of $4.28 billion improved over the Zacks consensus of $4.18 billion, +6% from this quarter a year ago. Net interest revenues grew +44% year over year, and shares are up +5% in early trading.The big banks are benefiting from the higher interest rates from the Fed, and quarter over quarter there has been a big difference in how much banks find themselves able to charge. The Fed funds rate, after all, was 100 bps lower at the start of Q3 than it was at the end; apparently, we can expect similar innate gains in banking business in Q4 for precisely the same reason.This is not to say Q3 earnings season is going to be a raging success, however; more industries feel the brunt of these interest rate hikes than benefit from them. But so far, so good: Pepsi PEP and Delta Air Lines DAL posted good reports last week. And the markets reflect this — at least to this early point in the day and week: the Dow is +350 points ahead of the open, the S&amp;P is +50 and the Nasdaq is +160 points.Questions or comments about this article and/or its author?

433,cf2c0d1a-f6d4-3d5d-920e-921f5ddba3a6,NI,2022-10-18,Investors in NiSource (NYSE:NI) have unfortunately lost 3.3% over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-nisource-nyse-ni-unfortunately-143712463.html,1666017432,STORY,"['NI', 'NIMC']","[For many investors, the main point of stock picking is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But its virtually certain that sometimes you will buy stocks that fall short of the market average returns. We regret to report that long term NiSource Inc. (NYSE:NI) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 12% in three years, versus a market return of about 26%. It's down 15% in about a month. We do note, however, that the broader market is down 9.2% in that period, and this may have weighed on the share price.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for NiSource There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the unfortunate three years of share price decline, NiSource actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 70% per year. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It is a little bizarre to see the share price down, despite a strong improvement to earnings per share. Therefore, we should look at some other metrics to try to understand why the market is disappointed.The company has kept revenue pretty healthy over the last three years, so we doubt that explains the falling share price. We're not entirely sure why the share price is dropped, but it does seem likely investors have become less optimistic about the business.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. You can see what analysts are predicting for NiSource in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for NiSource the TSR over the last 3 years was -3.3%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that NiSource shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 1.7% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 1.5% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand NiSource better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with NiSource (including 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) .Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Tractor Supply Is Tractor Supply Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$838.7mUS$1.03bUS$1.18bUS$1.30bUS$1.40bUS$1.48bUS$1.55bUS$1.62bUS$1.67bUS$1.72bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x3Est @ 13.88%Est @ 10.31%Est @ 7.81%Est @ 6.06%Est @ 4.84%Est @ 3.98%Est @ 3.38%Est @ 2.96% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$785US$905US$965US$996US$1.0kUS$999US$980US$954US$924US$890(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.4bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.7b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.0%) = US$36bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$36b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$19bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$28b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$199, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 22% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Tractor Supply as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.031. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Tractor Supply, we've compiled three additional aspects you should further examine:Risks: For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Tractor Supply (1 is concerning)  you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does TSCO's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market? Dig deeper into the analyst consensus number for the upcoming years by interacting with our free analyst growth expectation chart.Other Solid Businesses: Low debt, high returns on equity and good past performance are fundamental to a strong business. Why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals to see if there are other companies you may not have considered!PS.

First Eagle Investment Management was one of the company's leading stakeholders in Q2.Ariel Investments mentioned The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Rising interest rates, after a surprisingly long period of low absolute rates and negative “real” rates, will create a headwind. While there has been much debate about the cause of these low rates, we believe the most important factor has been the $120 billion in monthly federal reserve open market bond purchases and the accumulation of an $8 trillion balance sheet. The former will end, and the latter will shrink. It is not just the Fed that has aggressively purchased bonds, bidding up prices and lowering yields. Bond traders and hedge fund managers have added to positions, confident that being on the same side as the Fed was the wise place to be. Now as the Fed is about to become a seller of bonds rather than a buyer, Wall Street’s “smart money” is likely to follow suit. Against this backdrop, fixed income securities and bond substitutes such as high dividend paying utilities and absolute return hedge funds are substantially overpriced and are not likely to produce attractive returns going forward.This expectation of a reversion to the mean for interest rates helped 2021 performance, though not as much as we had hoped. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury did indeed increase from +0.92% at the beginning of the year to +1.52% at year-end. An underreported story was the poor performance of bonds last year. The Barclays Aggregate Index declined -1.67% for the year ending December compared to a return of +28.71% for equities as measured by the S&amp;P 500. Interest rates have continued to climb in 2022 with the 10-year Treasury at +1.79% as we go to print. This move higher in rates has contributed to our good, early start to 2022. Smaller positions in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) also benefited from higher rates, principally with their ability to invest customer cash.”7.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Mondelez International:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.094 = US$4.9b ÷ (US$66b - US$14b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).So, Mondelez International has an ROCE of 9.4%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Food industry average of 9.6%. Check out our latest analysis for Mondelez International roceIn the above chart we have measured Mondelez International's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEMondelez International has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 27% over the last five years. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.The Key TakeawayIn summary, we're delighted to see that Mondelez International has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. Since the stock has returned a solid 55% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.Story continuesMondelez International does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Mondelez International  that you might be interested in.While Mondelez International may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.6%– 2.0%) = US$106bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$106b÷ ( 1 + 8.6%)10= US$46bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$96b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$66.7, the company appears quite good value at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Occidental Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.423. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

BSX’s bottom line beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.04%, on average.Factors at PlayBoston Scientific expects third-quarter 2022 operational revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12% year over year. This excludes an approximate 400-basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on rates during the time of the Q2 earnings release but includes a 200-basis point contribution from the acquisitions of Farapulse, Lumenis and Baylis. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the company expects third-quarter 2022 organic revenue growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% against a much tougher year-over-year comparison.Meanwhile, BSX’s top line is likely to have improved year over year, with non-COVID elective medical procedures running in a full-fledged way in the United States and elsewhere across the globe. Given the improving scenario along with an innovative pipeline, expansion into faster growth markets, globalization efforts and enhanced digital capabilities, Boston Scientific is well-positioned to register decent third-quarter 2022 results.However, the rate of growth is expected to have remained sluggish, thanks to the emergence of the monkeypox waves in the past few months. The back-to-back attack of infectious diseases worldwide resulted in significant staffing shortages and supply disruption through the months of the third quarter. Further, given the ongoing inflationary situation, the business is expected to have faced the hurdle of surging labor and raw material cost, which might have weighed on BSX’s bottom line in Q3.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseBoston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseBoston Scientific Corporation price-eps-surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteStory continuesOn a geographic basis, every market of Boston Scientific is expected to have registered broad-based growth in the quarter under review on a year-over-year basis, considering the fact that the COVID impacts intensified in the third quarter of 2021.The company is expected to have registered strong growth in EMEA within structural heart, including TAVR, WATCHMAN, and other interventional cardiology therapies, as well as electrophysiology divisions, fueled by new product launches. In the Asia Pacific — particularly in Japan and Australia — product launches are expected to have contributed to the company’s top line. However, given the COVID wave and related restrictions in China, Boston Scientific anticipates more pressure on underlying procedural volumes in the second quarter.In the newly-formed WATCHMAN subsegment within the Cardiovascular division, according to the company, WATCHMAN is on track to deliver full-year double-digit growth with sustained momentum from the second-generation WATCHMAN FLX, ongoing clinical evidence, globalization, and commercial execution. Over the past few months, the company has continued making progress with new products and commenced the first WATCHMAN FLX cases in China, Korea, Singapore and Malaysia. This growth should get reflected in the third-quarter results.The Interventional Cardiology (IC) business is expected to have registered year-over-year growth in Structural Heart Valves and Complex PCI and Imaging franchises. The company had earlier discussed expanding its U.S. Vercise Genus offering in 2022 in partnership with Brainlab. The company’s imaging business is progressing as itsAVVIGO II guidance system moved into full launch in the United States. Internationally, strong growth continued, banking on the wide portfolio of imaging in treating complex coronary disease. All these might have positively contributed to third-quarter IC revenues.In Structural Heart franchises, the ACURATE neo2 launch in Europe is expected to have registered a positive performance in Q2.Within the Peripheral Interventions (PI) business, third-quarter sales are expected to have been strong, banking on the strong performance of the drug-eluting franchise, supported by ongoing clinical evidence and the company’s category leadership portfolio. Within Venous, Varithena is expected to report another quarter of strong growth, driven by a strong underlying market and penetration in new accounts.Interventional Oncology is expected to have gained from strong momentum in the company’s advanced cancer therapies, TheraSphere and ICEfx, as well as the robust set of embolization access and delivery tools.Within Urology/ Pelvic Health, sales of Stone, Prostate Health and Pelvic Health franchises are expected to have recorded strong growth banking on ongoing product launches such as LithoVue and SpaceOAR in key countries, with the momentum continuing with the recent approval of the Tria Firm Ureteral Stent in China. The Lumenis integration is expected to have made a strong contribution to the company’s sales.Within Endoscopy, broad-based recovery across regions and growing strength in infection prevention are expected to have driven second-quarter revenues. The company is expected to report strong momentum in biliary hemostasis and single-use imaging franchise.Within Neuromodulation, the company is likely to have registered balanced procedure recovery across RF (radiofrequency), Vertiflex and Spinal Cord Stimulation on strong execution of category leadership strategy in pain. The U.S. launches of WaveWriter Alpha and Vercise Genusare are expected to have boosted the top line.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter total revenues is pegged at $3.14 billion, suggesting an improvement of 7.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our model estimates 7.7% growth in Q3 revenues on a year-over-year basis.The consensus mark for adjusted earnings stands at 44 cents per share, implying a 7.3% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Per the Zacks model, adjusted earnings growth is expected to be 8% year over year.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsPer our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates.

439,57a1bacd-172f-3ec0-bc42-987efce05570,BSX,2022-10-18,Why Boston Scientific (BSX) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-boston-scientific-bsx-could-161004408.html,1666023004,STORY,['BSX'],"[Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Boston Scientific (BSX), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry.This medical device manufacturer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3.70%.For the most recent quarter, Boston Scientific was expected to post earnings of $0.42 per share, but it reported $0.44 per share instead, representing a surprise of 4.76%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.38 per share, while it actually produced $0.39 per share, a surprise of 2.63%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Boston Scientific. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Boston Scientific has an Earnings ESP of +2.63% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 26, 2022.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

KR is constantly making strategic endeavors to strengthen its position in the industry. In a latest development, this mega grocery retailer and Albertsons Companies ACI inked a definitive agreement under which both companies will combine their iconic brands to create a national foothold and unite KR's Purpose to Feed the Human Spirit. The deal, likely to close in early 2024 and unanimously approved by both companies’ boards, will boost KR’s go-to-market plan, and reinforce its value-creation model to boost profitability and generate higher returns.Per the terms of the agreement, Kroger will acquire the total outstanding shares of the latter’s common and preferred stock (on a converted basis) for an expected overall consideration of $34.10 per share. This comes to the total enterprise value of $24.6 billion, assuming $4.7 billion of ACI’s net debt.We note that the transaction is contingent on the receipt of a necessary regulatory clearance and other customary closing conditions, with the receipt of clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Regarding the receipt of a required regulatory clearance for the transaction, Kroger and Albertsons Companies are likely to make store divestitures. Subject to the divestiture process, ACI is expected to establish its subsidiary SpinCo, which will be a spin-off to Albertsons Companies’ shareholders before the closing of the merger. SpinCo, which will operate as a standalone public company, will include around 100-375 stores and establish a new competitor with quality stores, management and a sturdy balance sheet.The cash component of $34.10 per share consideration might be lowered by the per-share value of SpinCo. According to the terms of the transaction, ACI will pay a special cash dividend of up to $4 billion. The cash part of the consideration of $34.10 per share might get reduced by the per-share value of the special cash dividend, which may be $6.85. This dividend is payable Nov 7, 2022, to ACI’s shareholders of record as of Oct 24.Story continuesMore DetailsThe aforesaid transaction is likely to boost KR’s strategy of Leading with Fresh, Accelerating with Digital, thus enabling the new organization to support its go-to-market strategy comprising Fresh, Our Brands, Personalization and Seamless. Kroger also looks to bring ACI’s finest omni-channel capabilities to enrich its customers’ shopping experience.We note that Kroger holds on to its share repurchase program to prioritize de-leveraging following the merger. KR looks to accomplish a net leverage target of 2.5X EBITDA during the first 18-24 months after the merger’s closure. In second-quarter fiscal 2022, KR bought back $309 million shares and management had authorized a new $1-billion share buyback program. At the end of the second quarter, KR had a net total debt of $12,426 million.Regarding the reduction of prices for consumers, Kroger anticipates reinvesting roughly half a billion dollars of cost savings from synergies. An incremental $1.3-billion will also be invested in ACI’s outlets to boost the customer experience. The newly-formed entity is likely to invest $1 billion to increase associate wages and comprehensive benefits post close.Kroger and Albertsons Companies presently employ more than 710,000 associates, operating a total of 4,996 outlets, 66 distribution centers, 52 manufacturing plants, 3,972 pharmacies and 2,015 fuel centers. The merger of two purpose-driven companies into a grocery giant will offer customers the best shopping experience across stores and digital channels.Shares of this currently Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) player have increased 9.1% in the past year against the industry’s 9.6% decline.Here Are More Key Stocks for YouSome other top-ranked stocks are Ulta Beauty ULTA and Buckle BKE.Ulta Beauty, the leading beauty retailer, presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The BRU enhances pilot safety by allowing a mix of weapons and improves ground crew effectiveness through thoughtful operations and clearly visible indicators of critical release system elements.ProspectsThe United States, which is the largest exporter of military weaponry worldwide, is also strengthening military resources. This is quite evident from the fiscal 2023 budget proposal worth $773 billion put forward by the Biden administration for the Department of Defense, with $56.5 billion planned investments in combat aircraft. Impressively, the defense budget request reflects a 4.1% increase from the fiscal 2022 enacted amount.Such solid budgetary provisions should usher in contracts involving the production and upgrade of aircraft like the latest one. This in turn must benefit defense contractors like L3Harris, which designs and manufactures advanced EO/IR sensors and surveillance as well as targeting systems.

448,a0a47fb0-7437-36d2-83fb-ac7ff49e6916,NSC,2022-10-18,3 Blue-Chip Transportation Stocks on Investors' Watch List,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-blue-chip-transportation-stocks-172105219.html,1666027265,STORY,"['UNP', 'UPS', 'NSC']","[It is no longer news that the year 2022 has seen extreme market volatility so far. To tame the sky-high inflation in the United States, the Fed adopted a hawkish stance. Per the latest available data, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation for September 2022 was up 8.2% year over year. As a result of the higher-than-expected reading, the Fed, which already raised its core interest rate 3% year to date, is likely to continue its interest-raising policy in its future meetings this year.  Higher interest rates result in the cost of borrowing moving north, thus escalating the chances of an economic slowdown.This gloomy scenario and the uncertain path ahead are well reflected in the 19%, 34.81% and 25.4% year-to-date declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq composite and S&amp;P 500 indexes, respectively. Despite the current turmoil, shunning equities is never advisable for investors. So what’s the way forward?One way forward could be keeping tabs on blue-chip stocks, as they are financially sound and resilient to market swings. We apply this logic to the widely-diversified Zacks Transportation sector, the focus of this write-up. Industry heavyweights like United Parcel Service UPS, Union Pacific Corporation UNP and Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC clearly fit the bill and should be on an investor’s watch list.Tailwinds in the Transportation SectorEven though headwinds like the above-mentioned inflation-induced market volatility, supply-chain woes and high-fuel costs dented the prospects of the Transportation sector, inducing its 24.9% year-to-date decline, it is heartening to note that sector participants are surrounded by some positives.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOwing to the uptick in economic activities, freight demand continues to be strong despite minor hiccups. This is supporting growth for the transportation players like railroad operators. The Cass Freight shipments Index improved 4.8% year over year in September. The overall improving trend is evident from the fact that the measure has improved year over year in five (February, March, July, August and September) of the nine months reported so far this year.Story continuesWith people resuming their daily activities, following the relaxation of COVID-related restrictions, air-travel demand rebounded very strongly. This is good news for the airline companies in the sector. Even though economies are reopening, consumers’ urge for online shopping refuses to relent. This continued strength in e-commerce demand bodes well for companies like UPS.Transportation Stocks to WatchGiven the above tailwinds surrounding the sector, investors should keep tabs on stocks from this key field. To aid their search, we shortlisted three heavyweight stocks, which are financially mature and have large market capitalizations (above $50 billion).Moreover, these stocks boast a solid dividend-paying history. This adds to their appeal, especially in uncertain times as the present-day scenario. Retaining dividend stocks in one’s portfolio shows prudence, as these provide an avenue of steady income and a cushion against market risks. Our shortlisted stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our ChoicesUPS, with a current market cap of $140.45 B, is based in Atlanta. The package delivery entity is benefiting from the phenomenal rise in e-commerce demand during the pandemic.UPS pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.52 ($6.08 annualized) per share, which gives it a 3.76% yield at the current stock price.

The cash flow conversion rate was a healthy 73% in the first half of 2022. However, supply-chain woes are bothersome.UNP pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.30 ($5.20 annualized) per share.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Nano-Cap Stocks To Buy For 2022.Nano-cap stocks refer to companies that have a market cap of less than or around $50 million. These are volatile investments or trades and investors should always evaluate their risk tolerance before thinking about parking some cash in nano-caps.A study conducted by O’Shaughnessy Asset Management, a Connecticut-based money management firm, examined and compared the returns of small-caps and large-caps between 1964 and 2017. The researchers at OSAM found that small-cap stocks returned over 5.1% per year between 1964 and 2017 and outperformed large-cap stocks, which returned -11.0% per year over the same period.Nancy Prial, co-CEO of Massachusetts-based Essex Investment Management, appeared in an interview on CNBC where she made her bull case for small-cap stocks. Here are some comments from Nancy Prial:""We saw small-caps and interestingly even micro-caps outperform on a relative basis (in the third quarter of 2022), and small-cap growth and micro-cap growth were two of the only sectors that were actually up a little bit for the quarter. One of the other factors for small-caps here is not only are the stocks very attractively valued, selling at valuations of 10x or less, in aggregate, on next year's earnings and those earnings might be too high but that's still a great valuation. We have also seen, historically, that it's not really rising inflation so much as it is inflation that is high, leveling out, and starting to come down, which is the scenario that we think we are entering today. So that bodes very well for the outlook of this very neglected sector of the market (small-caps and micro-caps)...We are going to go into a market that rewards individual stocks, as opposed to macro themes, that will be even more tailwinds for the small-cap sector""Story continuesNano-cap stocks are not ideal for risk-averse investors. For investors with low risk tolerance, the best bet is to stick with investing in stable and mature businesses such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe screened for nano-cap stocks and identified stocks that had attractive valuations, strong fundamentals, and interesting growth catalysts.

MHK need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Nov 18, 2022 $65.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Mohawk Industries shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Mohawk Industries is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Textile - Home Furnishing industry that ranks in the Bottom  1% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $3.39 per share to $3.46 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Mohawk Industries right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Our proprietary system currently recommends Incyte (INCY) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this specialty drugmaker a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Incyte is 68.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 13.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 0%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Incyte has an S/TA ratio of 0.68, which means that the company gets $0.68 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.16, it can be said that the company is more efficient.In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Incyte looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 13.7% this year versus the industry average of 0%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Incyte have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.3% over the past month.Bottom LineIncyte has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Incyte well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The bottom line beat estimates by 8.9%, on average, over the trailing four quarters.Key Points to NoteWhirlpool has been reeling under global supply-chain disruptions and weak demand. Supply-chain disruptions have led to higher freight costs. These factors are likely to have marred the company’s margin performance in the to-be-reported quarter.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management predicted the inefficiencies across the supply chain, particularly in distribution and labor, to continue. It also anticipated the global cost inflation in steel and resins to remain a headwind. Inflationary pressures are likely to have significantly impacted the third-quarter 2022 performance.However, the company has been undertaking cost-based pricing efforts to help offset raw material inflation. It has also been on track with early and decisive actions to protect margins and productivity amid the ongoing supply-chain constraints and significant inflationary pressures.Whirlpool Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Whirlpool Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseWhirlpool Corporation price-eps-surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Whirlpool this time around.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Home Builder Stocks To Buy Now. The United States housing market is experiencing a drastic drop in home prices and simultaneously, the demand from buyers is also contracting. This is primarily due to potential home buyers reaching their affordability ceiling with the soaring mortgage rates. Similarly, sellers do not want to give up their houses, as they enjoy significantly lower fixed mortgage rates. Bloomberg cited Kelly Mangold of RCLCO Real Estate Consulting, in a report dated September 20: “While there is no lack of demand from households seeking to purchase, many of these same buyers cannot afford the high prices these new homes command with mortgage rates where they stand today.”Housing prices in the US have taken a turn for the worst and are indicating the largest monthly declines since 2009. The skyrocketing mortgage rates have driven affordability to the lowest level since the 1980s. While prices are declining on a month-over-month basis, they still remain significantly elevated, and are way greater than last year, when the buying frenzy was strong.Firms like Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, Moody's Analytics, Capital Economics, Zonda, Zelman &amp; Associates, Fannie Mae, and John Burns Real Estate Consulting believe that the sharpest home price declines are yet to be seen. This correction in the housing market will result in demand eventually picking up for new residential construction, renovations, and remodeling in the near future. However, home builder stocks are currently trading at large discounts, which makes it a good idea to pick them up before share prices shoot higher. Some of the best home builder stocks to buy now include Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR), and Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL). Our Methodology We selected the best home builder stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and growth prospects once the housing market gains momentum. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022. Story continues10 Best Home Builder Stocks To Buy Nowdcwcreations/Shutterstock.comBest Home Builder Stocks To Buy Now10. Latham Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWIM) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 13Latham Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWIM) is a New York-based company that designs, manufactures, and markets residential swimming pools in North America, Australia, and New Zealand. The company offers in-ground swimming pools, pool covers, and pool liners. Baird analyst Timothy Wojs on August 12 reiterated an Outperform rating on Latham Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWIM) but lowered the price target on the shares to $10 from $12. The analyst said Latham Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWIM) posted mixed Q2 results and slashed 2022 revenue/EBITDA guidance, citing the macro pressure on demand and destocking in vinyl packaged pools. However, the analyst noted that Latham Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWIM)’s valuation is favorable and the company has secular growth potential.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 13 hedge funds were bullish on Latham Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWIM) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 15 funds in the prior quarter. Richard S. Meisenberg’s ACK Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.50 million shares worth $10.4 million.  In addition to Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR), and Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL), Latham Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWIM) is one of the best home builder stocks to invest in.  Here is what Baron Funds has to say about Latham Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWIM) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“In the most recent quarter, we participated in the IPO of Latham Group, Inc., the largest manufacturer of fabricated pools globally. We believe this company is well positioned to benefit from several multi-year tailwinds including anticipated strength in the U.S. housing market, a cyclical recovery in new pool construction, and a secular growth opportunity as the company’s fiber glass pools offer several advantages versus most other pool options (concrete and vinyl, for example) including lower costs and maintenance, faster build times, and higher manufacturer profitability.”9. Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM) is a Colorado-based company that produces and sells construction materials to the public infrastructure, residential, and non-residential end markets. The company's products include aggregates, cement, ready-mix concrete, asphalt paving mixes, and concrete products. For the full-year 2022, Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM) reiterated its adjusted EBITDA guidance of approximately $500 million to $530 million. Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM) is one of the best home builder stocks to buy now. On October 10, Citi analyst Anthony Pettinari maintained a Buy recommendation on Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM) but lowered the price target on the shares to $29 from $35. The analyst trimmed estimates in North America building products ahead of the Q3 earnings season to factor in weak residential demand, ongoing cost pressure, unsuitable weather, and labor and material availability constraints. Within building products, the analyst leans towards aggregates producers as he anticipates increased public construction to significantly offset slow residential demand.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 15 hedge funds were bullish on Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM), compared to 21 funds in the prior quarter. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 893,982 shares worth nearly $21 million. Here is what Carillon Eagle Small Cap Growth Fund has to say about Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Summit Materials is a vertically integrated construction materials-based company that supplies aggregates, cement, ready-mix concrete, and asphalt in the United States and British Columbia. Fears of a potential economic slowdown and a corresponding cooling in construction activity weighed on the company’s shares in the quarter. However, Summit has made noteworthy strides in optimizing its business portfolio through the divestiture of underperforming assets, allowing it to drive margins higher through efficiency gains and accretive acquisitions. Summit also is the beneficiary of ongoing migration trends favoring construction activity in the exurban and rural markets it primarily serves.”8. Masonite International Corporation (NYSE:DOOR) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19Next on our list of the best home builder stocks is Masonite International Corporation (NYSE:DOOR), a company that designs, manufactures, and sells interior and exterior doors for construction and repair, renovation, and remodeling sectors of the residential and non-residential construction markets worldwide. On August 10, RBC Capital analyst Mike Dahl raised the price target on Masonite International Corporation (NYSE:DOOR) to $99 from $90 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares after its Q2 earnings beat. The company is facing demand slowdown on ""solid footing"" given its price/cost favorability and ""reasonable"" FY22 outlook, the analyst told investors in a research note. He added that Masonite International Corporation (NYSE:DOOR) trades at an ""attractive valuation"" of 5.4-times his new forecasted FY23 EBITDA.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 19 hedge funds were long Masonite International Corporation (NYSE:DOOR) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 20 funds in the prior quarter. Kevin Oram and Peter Uddo’s Praesidium Investment Management Company is the leading position holder in the company, with 1.5 million shares worth $114.2 million. 7. BlueLinx Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BXC) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20BlueLinx Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BXC) was incorporated in 2004 and is headquartered in Marietta, Georgia. The company distributes residential and commercial building products in the United States, as well as providing value-added services and solutions to customers and suppliers. BlueLinx Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BXC) caters to dealers, specialty distributors, national home centers, and manufactured housing customers through a chain of distribution centers. On October 3, BlueLinx Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BXC) announced that it had acquired privately-held Vandermeer Forest Products for $67 million. As per BlueLinx Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BXC), the deal was financed via cash on hand and is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings per share.Craig-Hallum analyst Greg Palm on August 4 reaffirmed a Buy recommendation on BlueLinx Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BXC) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $127 from $138. The analyst noted that BlueLinx Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BXC) posted strong Q2 results and provided a generally constructive outlook, even as it's obvious that the backdrop for housing has weakened significantly over recent months. The analyst does not think a slowdown in housing is as negative as investors believe.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 20 hedge funds were bullish on BlueLinx Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BXC), compared to 22 funds in the earlier quarter. Travis Cocke’s Voss Capital is the biggest position holder in the company, with 460,900 shares worth $30.8 million. Here is what Voss Capital has to say about BlueLinx Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BXC) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We believe those calling for a peak in housing activity have grown too cautious too soon. Most of the bearish arguments we encounter appear more sentiment based, e.g., prices have come too far too fast. Setting aside this understandably inherent acrophobia-induced caution and focusing more squarely on empirical evidence, the supply/demand picture remains on solid footing thanks to continued record low housing inventory accompanying fresh 30-year lows in single family and multifamily vacancies.6 Furthermore, roughly 2 million more people will turn 35 years old annually over the next five years, as compared to the previous five years. Since 35 is the peak first time home buying age, we believe there will be sustained demand for years to come. Our long portfolio remains heavily geared to entry-level housing related companies, as well as those tied to home remodeling.One of our preferred ways to express this bullish thematic view is through BlueLinx Holdings Inc. (BXC). We knew investors had been bracing for a profit collapse on the back of a fast 73% decline in lumber prices that occurred from May to September, but we had a differentiated view based on the company’s earnings mix that is skewed to Specialty products with less volatile pricing as opposed to purely commoditized framing lumber. The stock continues to be overly discounted based on apathy, ambiguity, and fear over the housing cycle. By our math, even in the unlikely event that BXC’s Structural Products segment produces $0.00 in gross profits over the next year (compared to $187.7M LTM) and their Specialty segment revenue declines 5-10% from here, the company still has sustainable earnings power in excess of $12 per share. At 10x earnings, a modest discount to the company’s long-term P/E ratio despite the balance sheet being deleveraged, the stock still has 63% upside. A more reasonable earnings power estimate is in the $16.50-$19.00 range, which puts the stock under 4x fully taxed net income. Unfortunately, the Board did not pull the trigger on any of their authorized share buybacks last quarter before the stock rose 50% after earnings. If they sharpen their pencils anytime soon and buy stock back at this depressed valuation, the normalized EPS number should only move higher.”6. Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (NYSE:AWI) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (NYSE:AWI) is headquartered in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, operating as a designer, manufacturer, and seller of ceiling systems for use in the construction and renovation of residential and commercial buildings in the United States, Canada, and Latin America. The company operates through Mineral Fiber and Architectural Specialties segments. Deutsche Bank analyst Joseph Ahlersmeyer initiated coverage of Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (NYSE:AWI) with a Buy rating and a $125 price target on August 17. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 24 hedge funds held stakes worth $601 million in Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (NYSE:AWI), compared to 32 funds in the last quarter worth $754 million. William Von Mueffling’s Cantillon Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.78 million shares valued at $133.5 million. Like Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR), and Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL), Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (NYSE:AWI) features as one of the best home builder stocks to invest in. Here is what Black Bear Value Partners has to say about Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (NYSE:AWI) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“AWI is a 129-year old designer and manufacturer of commercial and residential ceiling, wall, and suspension systems. 95% of their sales are for commercial use with the majority (70%) for repair and remodel (R&amp;R). This translates to less sensitivity to new construction as R&amp;R is a more stable revenue stream.The US ceiling industry is consolidated with the top 3 companies controlling 98% of the market. AWI is the market leader with 65% market shareDespite COVID related shutdowns AWI managed to generate ~$250MM in FCF which at today’s price equates to ~6% FCF yield. They have experienced sequential improvement in their end markets and should see more improvement as the world reopens.AWI should be able to generate $4-$5 in annual free cash flow which implies a current yield of 5-6% that should be able to grow 5-7% per year over the long-run. This is an excellent business at a cheap price.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Home Builder Stocks To Buy Now.

But unfortunately, some companies simply don't succeed. To wit, the General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) share price managed to fall 62% over five long years. That is extremely sub-optimal, to say the least. And it's not just long term holders hurting, because the stock is down 34% in the last year. But it's up 5.6% in the last week.The recent uptick of 5.6% could be a positive sign of things to come, so let's take a lot at historical fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, General Electric moved from a loss to profitability. On the other hand, it reported a trailing twelve months loss, suggesting it isn't reliably profitable. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.We don't think that the 0.5% is big factor in the share price, since it's quite small, as dividends go. Arguably, the revenue drop of 10% a year for half a decade suggests that the company can't grow in the long term. That could explain the weak share price.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. You can see what analysts are predicting for General Electric in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, General Electric's TSR for the last 5 years was -58%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that General Electric shareholders are down 34% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 25%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 10% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It is all well and good that insiders have been buying shares, but we suggest you check here to see what price insiders were buying at.General Electric is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

With FlightPulse for Business Jets, operators can leverage GE Digital’s library of safety events built from decades of industry experience in aviation software to help increase operational safety.Longtime customer Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., which currently has more than 3,000 aircraft in service around the world, is the development partner for FlightPulse for Business Jets. Gulfstream pilots collaborated with GE Digital to adapt the software for the business jet industry—and Gulfstream will continue to provide continuous feedback on data integrity for their aircraft, further improving GE Digital’s ability to provide quality safety analysis to operators.Designed by pilots, for pilots, FlightPulse has been used by commercial airlines since 2017 and provides access to data like never before. The Pre-flight module is designed to provide aggregated data from across the operation to enable more informed fuel decisions and departure safety briefings. The Post-flight module is engineered to provide secure access to data from a pilot’s individual flight history, allowing them to analyze their own operation of the aircraft in relation to their peers and self-discover areas to help refine piloting technique and capture efficiencies.Story continuesFlightPulse for Business Jets is an offering that is designed to serve as an extension of the Corporate Flight Operations Quality Assurance (C-FOQA) flight safety program. C-FOQA has been administered by GE since 2012 and is a community that includes over 350 corporate flight departments, all collaborating in the name of making the skies safer. The business jet version of FlightPulse is designed to provides the same industry-wide benchmarking insights produced by the C-FOQA program studies but delivers them directly into the hands of constituent pilots.""We were pleased to partner with GE Digital to help adapt this software for the business aircraft industry,"" said Vicki Britt, Gulfstream’s Senior Vice President of Engineering, Innovation, and Flight. ""FlightPulse collects and analyzes the data captured for each one of our flights and puts insights into the hands of our pilots. It gives us the ability to distill the same areas of awareness in real-time as trends evolve and is a great safety differentiator.""FlightPulse is designed to be a user-friendly intuitive interface that displays easily digestible information with automated integration, cleansing, and data validation. Data from the EMS platform can be organized specifically for the needs of a pilot. Pilots can access their data securely and privately through the mobile app. The solution is intended to provide four key operational benefits:Safety – Familiarizes pilots with industry-wide common threats and events for each aircraft type through a user-friendly intuitive interface that displays easily digestible information.Mobility – Facilitates a secure iOS app with private access to a pilot’s own flights, directly from their EFB.Empowerment – Creates self-learning moments and enable continuous improvement.""The future of flight may evolve, but safety will always take priority,"" said Andrew Coleman, General Manager of GE Digital’s Aviation Software business. ""This breakthrough solution puts data to work to produce insights that enable enhanced operator safety and efficiency. Instead of relying on disconnected data sources to prepare for and review flights, with FlightPulse pilots have access to data in a digital transfer of information from safety teams.""This news strengthens an already existing partnership between GE and Gulfstream. Today, Gulfstream customers benefit from GE’s Aircraft Health and Trend Monitoring (AHTMS) powered PlaneConnect HTM on the Gulfstream G500, G600, G650, and G650ER business jets.

469,392e0658-e924-3816-bad9-df94389ac89c,PGR,2022-10-18,The Progressive Corporation's (NYSE:PGR) institutional investors lost 3.3% last week but have benefitted from longer-term gains,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/progressive-corporations-nyse-pgr-institutional-110025779.html,1666090825,STORY,['PGR'],"[If you want to know who really controls The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 87% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.No shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 3.3% in value last week. However, the 35% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Progressive. See our latest analysis for Progressive ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Progressive?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Progressive already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Progressive's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Progressive is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.4% of shares outstanding. With 7.2% and 5.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and Wellington Management Group LLP are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 19 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of ProgressiveThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Progressive Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$236m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 13% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Progressive  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the ongoing Q3 earnings season and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including this morning's results, we now havre Q3 results from 38 S&amp;P 500 members that combined account for 10.7% of the index's total market capitalization. Total earnings for these 38 index members are down -4.7% from the same period last year on +9.4% higher revenues, with 76.3% beating EPS estimates and 57.9% beating revenue estimates. For the Finance sector which has an outisize weightage in the results at this stage, we now have results from 32.3% of the sector's market capitalization in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total Q3 earnings for these banks and brokers are down -12.3% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 91.7% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of these banks that have been beaten both EPS and revenue estimates is 66.7%. This is a better showing from these Finance sector companeis relative to what we have seen from the group in other recent periods. The 'blended' 66.7% beats % for this group of Finance sector companies compares to a low of 33.7%, high of 83.3% and average of 58.3% over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years). In other words, the Finance sector has given a better-than-expected start to this earnigns season. Today's Featured Research ReportsApple shares have declined -3.3% over the past year against the S&amp;P 500 index's -21.2% and decline and the -37.3% pullback in the Zacks Tech sector. Story continuesWhile there are undoubtedly some challenges for Apple on the near-term horizon as a result of the evolving uncertain macro backdrop, it should continue to benefit from continued momentum in the Services and robust performance from iPhone, Mac, Wearables and an expanding App Store ecosystem. The latest iPhone 14 models are witnessing high pre-order which is expected to drive top-line growth. We expect Apple’s fiscal 2022 revenues to increase 7.3% year over year with Services growing 14.1%..  On the flip side, Apple has a growing exposure to the uncertain Chinese market. The company’s services revenue growth is expected to be lower than the June quarter due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and unfavorable forex.Also, Apple did not provide revenue guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Apple expects year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate during the fiscal fourth quarter on a sequential basis, despite approximately 600 basis points of unfavorable year-over-year impact from forex.(You can read the full research report on Apple here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Abbott Laboratories shares have declined -11.7% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Products industry’s decline of -49.2%. The company’s total worldwide Nutrition and Pediatric Nutrition sales continued to be hampered due to the negative repercussions of a voluntary recall of certain powder formulae produced at one of Abbott's U.S. plants. Decline in organic sales in the Neuromodulation and Vascular businesses in the second quarter also raise apprehension.However, Abbott exited the second quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The top line benefitted from robust organic sales growth across core operating segments, barring Nutrition.The Diabetes Care business continued to benefit from the growing sales of sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system, FreeStyle Libre. We are particularly upbeat about the receipt of FDA clearance for the company’s FreeStyle Libre 3 system in May 2022.(You can read the full research report on Abbott Laboratories here &gt;&gt;&gt;)IBM shares have declined -13.7% over the past year against the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry’s decline of -21.0%. The company is facing stiff competition in the cloud computing market from the likes of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Higher debt levels amid extensive restructuring activities pose a concern for the company.High integration risk from continuous acquisition spree is another headwind. Muted cash flow outlook for 2022 due to the impact of dollar strength and winding down of business operations in Russia remain another downside for IBM. However, synergies from the Red Hat buyout are bolstering its competitive position in the hybrid cloud market.IBM’s growth is expected to be driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing, and security in the long haul. A combination of a better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investment in growth opportunities will likely drive profitability.(You can read the full research report on IBM here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Equinor ASA (EQNR), The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Southern Company SO, Valero Energy VLO and Fortinet FTNT.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Entering Q3 Earnings Season: Global Week AheadIn the Global Week Ahead, U.S. stock traders will enter the U.S. Q3 earnings season.China stock traders have seen a congress of China's ruling Communist Party kick off.FX traders are back on Japanese yen intervention watch.And across the remainder of global risk markets?According to Reuters, Britain’s government, for now, remains the key to whether a calmer mood can take a hold in markets unnerved by turmoil in the U.K. financial center. This has stoked wider worries about financial stability elsewhere.Next are Reuters’ five world market themes, reordered for equity traders:(1) Q3 U.S. S&amp;P 500 Earnings Season Now UnderwayThird-quarter U.S. earnings season heats up as companies report results in the throes of a difficult operating environment given a strengthening dollar and surging inflation.Earnings for S&amp;P 500 companies overall are expected to have climbed +4.1% from the year-earlier period, which would be the slowest growth since the fourth quarter of 2020.But more focus may be on how executives project the future; consensus analyst estimates are for a nearly +8% rise in profits next year, according to Refinitiv IBES.But many investors are dubious of that forecast as recession risks loom.A market slide has moderated stock valuations, but a downgrade in the earnings outlook could dampen equities' attractiveness.Upcoming earnings reports include results from Tesla, Netflix and Johnson &amp; Johnson.(2) Global Financial Market Stress UpdateOn top of UK turmoil, unease triggered by decades-high inflation, an energy shock and aggressive global rate hikes are putting markets through a stress test.Story continuesThe carnage in British gilts has exposed vulnerabilities in the pensions sector, shining a light on financial stability risks.So, the coming days will see increased focus on other possible hot spots that have gone under the radar of regulators.The IMF warns of ""disorderly asset repricings"" and ""financial market contagion.”Asset manager PIMCO reckons the U.K. is unlikely to be the only source of instability, adding that loan and private credit markets may also face stress.(3) Bank of England May Be Only the BeginningBarring a last-minute extension, from Monday the Bank of England (BoE) will no longer be the buyer of last resort of battered British bonds.The government's ""mini-Budget"" on Sept. 23rd sparked some of the biggest ever jumps in U.K. bond yields, spooked wider markets and triggered a crisis among pension funds needing to find bucket loads of cash.The BoE has been forced to intervene repeatedly to ensure financial stability, even as those measures contradict its task of fighting inflation by jacking up interest rates and selling some of the bonds it owns.The pensions industry has warned schemes aren't ready for bond-buying to end, while the government has suggested that if more volatility ensues the blame lies with the BoE.Growing expectations of a government u-turn on most of its unfunded tax cuts should end much of the pain.If it doesn't, buckle up for a messy Monday.(4) An FX Crisis Intervention Watch Is On, TooTraders are back on currency intervention watch as the dollar scales:Fresh 24-year peaks to the yen, andHeads back towards multi-year highs versus the Chinese yuan and Korean won.Japan's currency careened to the cusp of 147 per dollar on Wednesday, crashing through the trough at 145.89 that spurred the Bank of Japan to intervene last month to support the yen for the first time since 1998.South Korea also sold billions of dollars last quarter to prop up its currency, as the won plumbed a 13-year low just shy of 1,445 per dollar last month. Even so, it's not strayed far from there, nearing 1,440 this week.China has likely been deploying state banks to sell dollars and cushion the yuan's slide to ever-deeper 14-year lows, and traders are jittery over more aggressive steps to come.(5) Mainland China’s (Twice a Decade) Communist Party Congress UnderwayChina's twice-a-decade Communist party congress kicked off on Sunday, and the week-long, closed-door assembly is set to hand Xi Jinping an unprecedented third five-year term as supreme leader, securing his place as the country's most powerful ruler since Mao Zedong.It puts Xi in a position to pursue his vision for the ""rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,"" which includes the ""common prosperity"" policies that toppled behemoths including Alibaba and Evergrande.A desire to bring Taiwan under Beijing's control is also ramping up tensions with Washington.As for the economy, Xi has let that fall victim to other priorities: growth is set to miss a +5.5% target after repeated lockdowns under the zero-COVID program.The latest reading of gross domestic product is due Tuesday, after growth ground to a virtual halt in the second quarter.Hopes of pandemic controls relaxing at this congress could prove unfounded, considering how Beijing met a flare-up in cases just beforehand by barring many travelers in the recent Golden Week holiday from returning to the capital.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) StocksHere are three top large-cap picks, drawn from our latest #1 list.(1) The Southern Company: This is a $64 a share Electric Power Utility company, with a market cap of $65.3B.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group UnitedHealth Group's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. UnitedHealth Group managed to grow EPS by 14% per year, over three years. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. It's noted that UnitedHealth Group's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. EBIT margins for UnitedHealth Group remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 13% to US$315b. That's encouraging news for the company!In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of UnitedHealth Group's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre UnitedHealth Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$480b company like UnitedHealth Group. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$1.6b. This comes in at 0.3% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add UnitedHealth Group To Your Watchlist?One positive for UnitedHealth Group is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. It is worth noting though that we have found 1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group that you need to take into consideration.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

The latest iPhone 14 models are witnessing high pre-order which is expected to drive top-line growth. We expect Apple’s fiscal 2022 revenues to increase 7.3% year over year with Services growing 14.1%..  On the flip side, Apple has a growing exposure to the uncertain Chinese market. The company’s services revenue growth is expected to be lower than the June quarter due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and unfavorable forex.Also, Apple did not provide revenue guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.

First Eagle Investment Management was one of the company's leading stakeholders in Q2.Ariel Investments mentioned The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Rising interest rates, after a surprisingly long period of low absolute rates and negative “real” rates, will create a headwind. While there has been much debate about the cause of these low rates, we believe the most important factor has been the $120 billion in monthly federal reserve open market bond purchases and the accumulation of an $8 trillion balance sheet. The former will end, and the latter will shrink. It is not just the Fed that has aggressively purchased bonds, bidding up prices and lowering yields. Bond traders and hedge fund managers have added to positions, confident that being on the same side as the Fed was the wise place to be. Now as the Fed is about to become a seller of bonds rather than a buyer, Wall Street’s “smart money” is likely to follow suit. Against this backdrop, fixed income securities and bond substitutes such as high dividend paying utilities and absolute return hedge funds are substantially overpriced and are not likely to produce attractive returns going forward.This expectation of a reversion to the mean for interest rates helped 2021 performance, though not as much as we had hoped. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury did indeed increase from +0.92% at the beginning of the year to +1.52% at year-end. An underreported story was the poor performance of bonds last year. The Barclays Aggregate Index declined -1.67% for the year ending December compared to a return of +28.71% for equities as measured by the S&amp;P 500. Interest rates have continued to climb in 2022 with the 10-year Treasury at +1.79% as we go to print. This move higher in rates has contributed to our good, early start to 2022. Smaller positions in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) also benefited from higher rates, principally with their ability to invest customer cash.”7.

If you want to see some more undervalued stocks to buy,  go directly to 5 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.Undervalued stocks are defined as stocks that arguably trade for below what they are worth in terms of their fair value. Given each stock is different, there is no real metric to define which stocks are undervalued and which aren't. Forward Price to earnings ratios are not perfect as analyst estimates could be wrong and market valuations can change over time. Analyst price targets are also just a reflection of what analysts think and not what will actually happen.Nevertheless, the two metrics are still useful as information, and generally undervalued stocks are stocks of high quality companies that trade substantially below their historical valuations. Given that markets can be bearish at times, high quality stocks can be undervalued and their stock prices can go even lower for a long time.Due to the Federal Reserve having increased interest rates 5 times this year, the markets have fallen substantially in 2022. The S&amp;P 500 is down around 25% and the NASDAQ is down around 35%.As a result, the stocks of many high quality companies with quality earnings potential and strong competitive advantages have fallen substantially year to date.If the economy recovers in the long run, the stocks of those high quality companies could recover and rise too.When that happens, however, is uncertain and it looks like 2023 could be a year with potentially more rate hikes and an economic recession as well.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to hold a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors. If economic data fails to meet estimates or sentiment worsens, the market could decline further. In the long term, however, the earnings per share of the high quality companies will likely continue to grow and their stock prices could be higher if the market becomes more bullish.Story continues7 Stocks to Buy According to Eduardo Costa's Calixto Global InvestorsSource: pexelsMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now, we selected stocks that we think have the right mix of value, competitive advantages and scale.

Kimberly Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Kimberly Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) is a leading consumer products company that has a forward P/E ratio of 17.86 and also a dividend yield of 4.1% as of October 16. Although the world faces headwinds and there could be a recession in 2023, Kimberly Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB)'s earnings per share is likely steadier than many other companies and Kimberly Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB)'s stock could potentially bounce back from its down 20.79% year to date performance in 2022 once things normalize in the longer term.Of the 895 hedge funds in our database, 24 owned shares of Kimberly Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) at the end of the second quarter.Alongside Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Kimberly Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) is an undervalued stock that's held by many hedge funds in our database at the end of Q2 2022.11. The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) is a leading household and personal products company with a forward P/E of almost 25. While that's still premium priced, The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) has a dividend yield of 3.6% as of 10/16.Although some analysts aren't as bullish on the company given the average analyst target price of $130.07 versus the current stock price of $131.29, The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) has high quality earnings and its earnings potential could bounce back to pre-Covid levels in the long term. In the near term, the company could have downside if sentiment weakens or the economy worsens.With 31 hedge fund holders we track owning shares of The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) at the end of Q2 2022, the company ranks #11 on our list of 12 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.10. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55While Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has a P/E ratio of 24.29 and a forward P/E ratio of 25.74, the company has a durable income stream and is arguably undervalued. Analysts have an average target price of $96.71 per share on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Matrix Asset Advisors commented on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a premiere global coffee brand supported by over 32,600 stores across the world. The firm has a long history of beverage innovation and strong employee/barista relations with the firm paying above-market wages and benefits. Starbucks has a strong balance sheet and finances. The company generates steady and consistent cash flow, selling millions of cups of premium coffee every day. The company’s share price declined in part due to its large business in China which was largely shut down due to Covid restrictions and because of rising commodity and labor costs. We think the shares are attractively priced for a company that should grow 10% plus per year with a dividend yield of 2.6% at our average cost.9. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is down 23.5% year to date given the S&amp;P 500's decline of around 25% year to date. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)'s dividend yield of 2.92% as of October 16 also isn't as attractive given the Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. Nevertheless, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has high quality earnings that are likely pretty durable. In the long term, the stock could bounce back if the economy rebounds. Analysts have an average price target of $149.21 per share.8. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares have fallen substantially year to date with the stock down almost 50% in 2022. According to NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)'s first quarter earnings report, inventories are building and the company's gross margins are weaker. If there is a recession in 2023, the company could find it harder to maintain its growth. In the long term, however, demand for NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)'s products will likely return to normal and the company's stock price could potentially be higher. Analysts have an average price target of $113.04 per share.7. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a high quality conglomerate that is selling for just 15.6 times forward earnings estimates. Although the Federal Reserve rate hikes have made the Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s dividend yield of around 2.75% as of October 16 less attractive, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) still has long term upside. Demand for healthcare products will only grow as the world develops.83 hedge funds in our database owned shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) at the end of the second quarter, ranking it #7 on our list of 12 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.6. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 104JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a bank that has benefited from higher net interest income due to the rising interest rates. Nevertheless, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) also faces potential headwinds if the economy slows due to the rapid rise in those rates and its stock could fall further in the near term.In the long term, however, the bank has a lot of qualities that might make it undervalued.  Vltava Fund said the following about JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term. JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008. A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.In addition to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are undervalued stocks held by many hedge funds at the end of Q2 2022.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.Suggested articles:15 Most Valuable British CompaniesMost Valuable Companies in HistoryTop 10 High Dividend Stocks To Buy NowDisclosure: None. 12 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

At the same time, a recent study from IdeaWorks found that the percentage of revenue airlines derive from baggage fees has been rising steadily — 3.7% in 2019, 3.9% in 2020 and 4.6% in 2021. In February 2021, five passengers who traveled with American Airlines filed a class action lawsuit that accused the airline of incorrectly charging them baggage fees that they were not required to pay.Continue reading]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Delta Air Lines DAL, American Airlines AAL, United Airlines UAL, Gol Linhas GOL and Copa Holdings CPA.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Airline Stock Outlook: Delta's Q3 Earnings &amp; MoreOn Oct 13, Delta Air Lines kick-started the third-quarter 2022 earnings season in the airline space. This Atlanta-based carrier reported lower-than-expected earnings per share due to high costs and Hurricane Ian–induced disruptions. American Airlines was also in the news when its management upped the revenue growth forecast for the September quarter owing to strong air-travel demand. An expansion update from United Airlines was also available in the past week.However, Latin American carrier Gol Linhas expects to incur a loss in the third quarter due to high fuel costs even though air-travel demand remains strong. Another Latin American carrier Copa Holdings’ traffic increased in September from the comparable period’s level in 2019 (pre-coronavirus), again reflecting upbeat air-travel demand.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1. Delta’s third-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 42 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.51 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56. DAL reported earnings of 30 cents per share a year ago, dull in comparison to the current scenario, as air-travel demand was not so buoyant then. In the third quarter of 2022, total revenues increased more than 52% on a year-over-year basis. The same increased 11% from third-quarter 2019 actuals.The fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted revenue guidance is encouraging and expected to increase in the 5-9% band from the fourth-quarter 2019 actuals, driven by strength in domestic air-travel demand and fast-recovering international travel demand. While air-travel demand is very strong for leisure, business travel is also bouncing back. Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected in the 9-11% range.Story continues2.  American Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects total revenues for third-quarter 2022 to rise approximately 13% from the third-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier expectation: increase 10-12%). Total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a measure of unit revenue) is now anticipated to be 25% higher than the third-quarter 2019 reading (earlier estimate was a 20-24% rise).Driven by upbeat demand, the pre-tax margin, excluding net special items, is anticipated to be 4.5% compared with the 2-4% band expected earlier. The third-quarter operating margin (excluding net special items) is expected to be roughly 7%. The average fuel cost per gallon forecast is maintained in the $3.73-$3.78 range. However, the guidance for fuel gallons consumed is decreased to 1,031 million from 1,040 million.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3. For the third quarter of 2022 (detailed results of which will be out on Oct 27), Gol Linhas anticipates EBITDA margin to be approximately 15% and the EBIT margin to be roughly 5%. GOL estimates an average fuel price per liter to be R$ 6.62. Management anticipates a loss per share of R$1.8, indicating a loss Per American Depositary Shares of 70 cents for the third quarter.Fuel unit costs are anticipated to grow almost 87% from the prior-year actuals, backed by an 89% increase in the average jet fuel price. Passenger unit revenues for the to-be-reported quarter are expected to increase roughly 45% from the year-ago reported figure, driven by upbeat domestic air-travel demand (mainly for leisure) and the gradual recovery in international travel.Reflecting bullish air-travel demand, GOL’s consolidated traffic in September increased 41.4% from the year-ago level. That story was covered in detail in the previous week’s write-up.4. In September 2022, Copa Holdings’ traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), increased 3.5% to 1.75 billion from the comparable period’s level in 2019. Increased passenger volume led to this upside. To match upbeat demand, CPA is increasing capacity — measured in available seat miles (ASMs) — which inched up 1.2% from the 2019 level to 2 billion. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) improved 200 basis points (bps) to 86.9% in the last month.5. United Airlines reportedly decided to add flights to Australian cities with the relaxation of COVID-related travel restrictions and the surge in air-travel demand. UAL plans to fly nonstop from San Francisco International Airport to Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney; from Los Angeles International Airport to Melbourne and Sydney; and from Houston to Sydney.PerformanceThe table above shows that all airline stocks, apart from Gol Linhas, have traded in the green over the five trading days. Gol’s forecast of a third-quarter loss might have induced the southward movement of the stock. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index has inched up 0.4% to $52.88 over the past five trading days. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has plummeted 34.3%.What's Next in the Airline Space?Investors will keenly await the third-quarter 2022 results of United Airlines and American Airlines, scheduled to be out on Oct 18 and Oct 20, respectively. We expect strong air-travel demand to have aided the top-line performances of both UAL and AAL. However, high fuel costs are likely to have dented their bottom-line performances.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

(NASDAQ:ORLY). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on O'Reilly Automotive’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for O'Reilly Automotive What Is O'Reilly Automotive Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 12% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy O'Reilly Automotive today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $829.30, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. What's more, O'Reilly Automotive’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.What kind of growth will O'Reilly Automotive generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. O'Reilly Automotive's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder?

Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ORLY, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about O'Reilly Automotive as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

REGN recently announced that the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) has adopted a positive opinion for the oncology drug Libtayo (cemiplimab).The CHMP recommended approval of the drug as a monotherapy for treating adult patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer and disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.A final decision is expected in the coming months.Libtayo is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T cells.The positive opinion is supported by results from the phase III EMPOWER-Cervical 1 study, which met the primary endpoint of overall survival. Libtayo reduced the risk of death by 31% in the total population and 27% in the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) population compared to an investigator's choice of chemotherapy.The study was stopped early in March 2021 based on the highly significant effect of Libtayo on overall survival among SCC patients and following a unanimous recommendation by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee.We note that Libtayo is currently approved in the EU and other countries for the treatment of certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Shares of Regeneron have risen 15.8% so far this year against the industry’s decline of 26.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegeneron is looking to diversify into the lucrative oncology space with Libtayo. The drug is also indicated in the United States and other countries in certain patients with advanced BCC, advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma CSCC and advanced NSCLC, as well as in advanced cervical cancer in Canada and Brazil.The drug is currently being evaluated in trials as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for other solid tumors and blood cancers.Story continuesWhile Libtayo holds promise, competition is stiff in this oncology space with many formidable drugs. Hence, Libtayo has a long way to go before contributing significantly to the top line.Regeneron has many arms in its arsenal. Lead drug Eylea (aflibercept), approved for various ophthalmology indications, has been a steady growth driver and should maintain momentum on sustained label expansions.However, stiff competition from the potential entry of generics and new treatment options weigh on Eylea, forcing Regeneron to diversify its revenue base.Another growth driver in Regeneron’s armory is Dupixent, for which it has a collaboration with Sanofi SNY. Solid sales of Dupixent (approved for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, eosinophilic esophagitis) have boosted the top line significantly. Sanofi records global net product sales of Dupixent, while REGN records its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of the drug.Regeneron is also looking to foray into the challenging but promising nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) space with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing therapy with Intellia Therapeutics, Inc.Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

501,5d8ec4c6-afdd-3250-974b-a59330efe5ec,REGN,2022-10-18,"An Intrinsic Calculation For Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) Suggests It's 37% Undervalued",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-inc-140018855.html,1666015218,STORY,['REGN'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.77bUS$4.96bUS$5.11bUS$5.21bUS$5.30bUS$5.40bUS$5.50bUS$5.60bUS$5.71bUS$5.82bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x4Est @ 1.78%Est @ 1.84%Est @ 1.88%Est @ 1.91%Est @ 1.93%Est @ 1.95% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.9% US$4.5kUS$4.4kUS$4.3kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$39bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (5.9%– 2.0%) = US$151bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$151b÷ ( 1 + 5.9%)10= US$85bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$124b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$736, the company appears quite undervalued at a 37% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.840. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

To tame the sky-high inflation in the United States, the Fed adopted a hawkish stance. Per the latest available data, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation for September 2022 was up 8.2% year over year. As a result of the higher-than-expected reading, the Fed, which already raised its core interest rate 3% year to date, is likely to continue its interest-raising policy in its future meetings this year.  Higher interest rates result in the cost of borrowing moving north, thus escalating the chances of an economic slowdown.This gloomy scenario and the uncertain path ahead are well reflected in the 19%, 34.81% and 25.4% year-to-date declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq composite and S&amp;P 500 indexes, respectively. Despite the current turmoil, shunning equities is never advisable for investors. So what’s the way forward?One way forward could be keeping tabs on blue-chip stocks, as they are financially sound and resilient to market swings. We apply this logic to the widely-diversified Zacks Transportation sector, the focus of this write-up. Industry heavyweights like United Parcel Service UPS, Union Pacific Corporation UNP and Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC clearly fit the bill and should be on an investor’s watch list.Tailwinds in the Transportation SectorEven though headwinds like the above-mentioned inflation-induced market volatility, supply-chain woes and high-fuel costs dented the prospects of the Transportation sector, inducing its 24.9% year-to-date decline, it is heartening to note that sector participants are surrounded by some positives.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOwing to the uptick in economic activities, freight demand continues to be strong despite minor hiccups. This is supporting growth for the transportation players like railroad operators. The Cass Freight shipments Index improved 4.8% year over year in September. The overall improving trend is evident from the fact that the measure has improved year over year in five (February, March, July, August and September) of the nine months reported so far this year.Story continuesWith people resuming their daily activities, following the relaxation of COVID-related restrictions, air-travel demand rebounded very strongly. This is good news for the airline companies in the sector. Even though economies are reopening, consumers’ urge for online shopping refuses to relent. This continued strength in e-commerce demand bodes well for companies like UPS.Transportation Stocks to WatchGiven the above tailwinds surrounding the sector, investors should keep tabs on stocks from this key field. To aid their search, we shortlisted three heavyweight stocks, which are financially mature and have large market capitalizations (above $50 billion).Moreover, these stocks boast a solid dividend-paying history. This adds to their appeal, especially in uncertain times as the present-day scenario. Retaining dividend stocks in one’s portfolio shows prudence, as these provide an avenue of steady income and a cushion against market risks.

This peer reviewed study found that less than 41% of pregnant people were screened for HCV in 2021, based on Quest Diagnostic's laboratory testing of more than 5 million pregnant patients. The study also found that individuals with Medicaid health insurance were screened at rates 25-35% lower than those with commercial insurance.""Our Health Trends research revealed that despite guidelines recommending HCV screening in pregnancy, many people are not receiving the testing they need. Individuals in underserved communities are most likely to experience this gap in care,"" said Damian ""Pat"" Alagia, MD, Senior Medical Director, Women's Health, Quest Diagnostics. ""Screening for HIV, HBV and syphilis is already standard in obstetric panels, and it is no coincidence that screening rates for these diseases during pregnancy are more than double the current rate as for HCV. By adding HCV screening to our obstetrics panel, physicians will be more likely to deliver guideline-based care that reduces HCV infection during pregnancy and fosters a positive outcome for the patient and their newborn.""""Our new test service is a prime example of how Quest Diagnostics illuminates care gaps from its uniquely large laboratory dataset and then creates solutions to improve patient care and public health,"" said Harvey W. Kaufman, MD, Senior Medical Director, Head of the Health Trends Research Program for Quest Diagnostics, and a lead of the study published in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology.Story continuesObstetric panels are typically performed early in pregnancy and include guideline-recommended tests, such as complete blood count (CBC), blood typing, hepatitis B, syphilis, and rubella, to help guide clinical decisions affecting the pregnancy and mother's health.i In recent years, hepatitis C infections have risen in pregnant people and other populations in the United States, largely due to increased intravenous drug use. Between 2020-2021, the United States Preventative Services Task Force, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine issued practice guidance recommending one-time hepatitis C screening during pregnancyii,iii while the CDC issued guidance recommending HCV screening for all pregnant people except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is less than 0.1%.ivHepatitis C is the most common bloodborne infection in the United States and is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality.v An estimated 1,700 infants were born with HCV infection (acquired in utero) each year between 2011 and 2014.viAbout Quest Diagnostics Health Trends®Quest Diagnostics Health Trends® is a series of scientific reports that provide insights into health topics, based on analysis of HIPAA-compliant, objective clinical laboratory data, to empower better patient care, population health management and public health policy.

To ignore our industry introduction, and to jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, head on over to 5 Technology Stocks To Buy That Are Too Cheap To Ignore. Taking a look at the broad stock market, which consists of a myriad of sectors such as construction, industrial, agriculture, and furniture, one of the strongest growing sectors is technology. Spurred by the advances in chip fabrication, today's computing devices are vastly more powerful than those just two decades back. These have driven a variety of technology industries, ranging from enterprise computing to the metaverse.For investors looking to profit from this growth, this year's stock market bloodbath spurred by rapid interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve can provide the perfect opportunity to buy shares. This is simply due to the fact that the share prices that have dropped are due to the general macroeconomic environment and not because of underlying problems with the companies themselves.The trend in technology stocks can be explained better by no one other than the billionaire Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments. The investor recently outlined that:. . .that means when we get to the bottom whenever that is, you should expect to see tech, because it's been lagging, because we've had more down days than up this year, which you know by definition since we've had a down year in 2022 through the middle of the summer. You should expect to see it leading once we hit that bear market bottom and start on the other side. Now I don't want to argue with you in this video about direction of the market, I do want to say once you get down this far into a bear market, it is not terribly long in time until you normally get to a bottom. We can debate what that is, but once you get into the bottom, you should see tech leading for about the next year. And therefore, and maybe longer, but for about the next year. And therefore, we should be seeing most of the next year led by tech going up. I want to step back and reiterate, market down, tech down more. Market up, tech up more. Correlation to that is so high and yet not widely perceived by people. I've not seen anything stated on this in public anywhere, but it's a simple, unseen fact. And facts are stubborn things. And the stubbornness of that ripples over into this feature, that I just articulated. As categories, not individual stocks, categories. Falls the most in bear markets, bounces the most for a good long time coming off the bottom. And you should expect that with tech as we hit a bottom, when we hit a bottom.Story continuesBuilding upon Mr. Fisher's thoughts, research firm Research and Markets believes that the global information technology market was worth $7.8 trillion in 2020, and despite this size, it will still grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 9% to sit at a whopping $11 trillion in 2025.Today's piece will focus on the cheap technology stocks that are easy to invest in, and some companies likely to catch your attention include Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
