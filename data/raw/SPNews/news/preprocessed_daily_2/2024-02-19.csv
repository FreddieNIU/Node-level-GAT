If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on choosing your next retirement destination, you may go to 5 States That Don’t Tax Your Retirement Income.', 'As you bid farewell to your career, the next consequential question emerges: where shall you choose to spend your golden years? Choosing where to retire largely influences how far your nest egg can go, which is why this decision must be taken wisely.', '""Whether you\'re a retiree, a remote worker, or just looking for a change of scenery, the idea of pulling up stakes for purportedly greener pastures isn\'t that unusual these days. However, the tax implications can be profound, so it\'s smart to take a hard look before you break out the packing tape.""', '-Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, director of tax and financial planning at the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) Center for Financial Research.', 'Exploring the findings from the 2023 annual survey by U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) and United Van Lines, we discover that New Jersey is among the top states witnessing the most outbound moves. A considerable portion of these individuals consists of older, higher-income retirees who are, in turn, choosing to relocate South. They are favoring states with lower taxes and a more affordable cost of living, a strategic move aimed at ensuring the longevity of their retirement savings.', ""Another state that has reflected the largest net loss of one-way movers, as revealed in U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL)'s study, is California. Yet other states that have witnessed rock-bottom growth moves include Illinois and Massachusetts. While California, New Jersey, and Massachusetts are some of the worst states for their cost of living and it’s understandable why people are looking to move, the same cannot be said about Illinois."", 'So why is it that Illinois is witnessing this substantial outmigration of residents to other states? The answer may be in its taxes. According to a study by the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute, 47% of Illinoisans said they wanted to leave the state back in 2016. It also found that the single biggest reason that they quoted for wanting to leave was these very “taxes”. As of 2023, the Illinois Policy Institute’s Lincoln Poll has revealed that 51% of voters said they would leave if they could. Same as previous, these voters have taxes to blame. The statistics concerning Illinois, along with the trend of outbound moves from states like California and New Jersey, unequivocally convey that individuals are inclined to avoid locations that impose higher costs on them.', 'Further analysis of the U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) study finds that the most popular destinations of one-way U-Haul® truck customers were Florida, Texas, and the Carolinas. As outlined by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), high-income workers may gravitate towards states that don’t tax retirement income. However, focusing only on the income tax isn’t the right way to go. According to Hayden, director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, taxes shouldn’t be your first consideration. It should be considered along with other factors that are important to you as a retiree, such as climate, quality of healthcare, and even proximity to family. In other words, the right way to go when choosing your potential retirement destination is to map out a list of all the places where you can live in your retirement years.', '""So, if you wish to live by the beach or close to one of your kids, for example, figure out all the places you could live—then take a look at which taxes matter most based on your situation and stage of life.""', 'Take the example of Florida which is considered one of the most tax-friendly states for retirees.', '""Florida\'s lack of an income tax may seem like a bargain, but property tax there is high, and the government raises the bulk of its revenue through state and local sales taxes”.', '--Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.', 'Bottom-line? Retiring to states that don’t tax your pension or social security isn’t enough. The key is to consider your entire tax burden so that you can make the best possible retirement move financially.', 'With that said, let’s move on to the states that don’t tax your retirement income, and see how friendly these states are overall.', 'GagliardiImages/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile the list of states that don’t tax your retirement income, we began by listing out all states and checked out their tax-friendliness. Nine states were selected that have no state income tax. Next, another six states that don’t tax pension income were selected from AARP. Out of the six states, four states are tax-friendly according to Smart Asset, and two are moderately tax-friendly. To make a list of 15, we excluded one moderately tax-friendly state due to its higher cost of living. Next, the states were ranked based on their overall tax-friendliness and their cost of living. For taxes, states were allotted a score from 1-4, with 1 being least tax-friendly to 4 being very tax-friendly. These have been sources from Smart Asset. The cost of living for the states has been sourced from the Missouri Economic Research & Information Center. Scores were totaled and states were ranked in an ascending order from the lowest to the highest scores.', 'It is important to note that the taxation of retirement income comes with a myriad of intricacies. First, federal tax is still owned on retirement income even if the state itself does not impose an income tax. Moreover, while many states impose taxes on distributions, virtually all of them provide some level of tax relief for retirees. This relief may take the form of a tax cap, an income limit on exemptions, or other beneficial breaks. Given the dynamic nature of state tax laws, it remains imperative to stay abreast of changes through regular updates from your state tax commission.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Since there is no income tax in the state, all retirement income to seniors goes tax-free. Moreover, there is no sales tax in the state, and no estate or inheritance tax either. The only significant tax in this state is its property tax, which is 1.17%-slightly higher than the national average. What’s more-living in Alaska can be financially advantageous for retirees. This is because the state offers incentives to individuals who choose to live there permanently. The Alaska Permanent Dividend fund, as it is called, goes to every eligible Alaskan resident. However, seniors may think twice before they choose to move to this state because of the harsh weather and the oh-so-high cost of living, making it one of the worst states to retire on social security. The cost of living in this state is a whopping 25.2% higher than the national average.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 5', 'Tax Friendliness: Tax-Friendly', 'Cost of Living Index: 116', 'In the state of Washington, there is no state income tax on social security or other forms of retirement income. This is because, like Alaska, the state has no income tax. The good news for retirees who live here is that those who wish to work part-time even after retirement can do so tax-free. Property tax rates in the state are slightly lower than the national average, However, the state churns out its revenue from its high sales tax rate. Statewide, the sales tax rate is 6.5%. Some cities and counties impose their own sales tax rate that can be as high as 4%. Collectively, seniors can expect to pay a sales tax as high as 10.5%. However, there are some sales tax exemptions available. Even though the state of Washington has a pretty high cost of living, 16% higher than the national average, many seniors living there may not have the heart or the energy to move. For seniors like these, we have curated a list of some of the best places to retire in Washington on social security.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 6', 'Tax Friendliness: Tax-friendly', 'Cost of Living Index: 114.1', 'Next on our list of states that don’t tax retirement income is New Hampshire. While the state doesn’t tax social security or other retirement income, dividends and interest are taxed for the current tax year. According to the NH Department of Revenue Administration, this tax rate is 5% for taxable periods ending before December 31, 2023, 4% for taxable periods ending on or after December 31, 2023, and 3% for taxable periods ending on or after December 31, 2024. The I&D tax shall be repealed for taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2024. New Hampshire is also one of the few states that don’t have a sales tax. Besides all the good news, this state bears some of the highest property tax rates in the country. The average effective property tax rate is 2.09%, which is higher than the national average. Moreover, cost of living in this state is 14.1% higher than the national average.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 8', 'Tax Friendliness: Very Tax- Friendly \xa0', 'Cost of Living Index: 101', 'The state of Nevada has no state income tax. As a result, all sorts of retirement income in the state goes to seniors tax-free. The state of Nevada can be a great place to retire considering it is a sunny state and the cost of living is close to the national average. Property taxes in the state are low, whereas sales tax is higher than the national average. Retirees can stretch their dollars further here in Nevada, and it’s even possible to retire on social security. This tax-friendly state has one of the lowest average retirement age in the US at 63 years.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 9', 'Tax Friendliness: Very Tax-friendly ', 'Cost of Living Index: 100.7', 'Another state with no income tax on our list is Florida. The sunny state of Florida has many great places to retire, and the biggest draw for seniors is that it’s one of the states that don’t tax your retirement income. Moreover, sales taxes and property taxes do exist. However, both of them are close to national marks. The statewide sales tax rate, except for a few exemptions, is 6%. Combining local sales tax rates, the total can be as high as 8.25%. Warm and sunny weather, tax-friendly environment, and a close-to-national-average cost of living makes Florida one of the most popular states to retire to in the US.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 9 ', 'Tax Friendliness: Tax-friendly ', 'Cost of Living Index: 95.6', ""Pennsylvania falls amongst the states that don’t tax social security. It is a tax-friendly state that fully exempts all social security, as well as payments from retirement accounts, from taxes. For seniors aged 60 and over, there is even an exemption from taxes on pension income. The cherry on top of Pennsylvania's tax-friendliness is its low cost of living. The cost of living in this state is 4.4% lower than the national average, so retirees have a chance to stretch their retirement incomes further in this state."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 10 ', 'Tax Friendliness: Tax-friendly \xa0', 'Cost of Living Index: 92.7', 'The state of Texas does not have an income tax and is quite a tax-friendly state to retire to. This Lone Star state can be a great place to retire, considering all retirement income goes to seniors tax-free and the cost of living is also lower than the national average. On the downside, property and sales taxes are some of the highest in the US. The average effective tax rate in the state is 1.9%, which is one of the highest in the country. Meanwhile, the sales tax rate is about 6.25%, with local sales tax can be as high as 2%. Retirees can live in some of the best cities in Texas on less than $2,500 a month.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 12 ', 'Tax Friendliness: Very Tax-friendly ', 'Cost of Living Index: 92.4', 'Next on our list of states that don’t tax your retirement income is South Dakota. There is no income tax in the state, which is why all types of retirement income go tax-free. What makes this state a very tax-friendly one is that even the sales tax is low. Meanwhile, property tax rates are a bit high but they can be offset by seniors. This is because the cost of living in this state is 7.6% lower than the national average. South Dakota even offers a Homestead Exemption Program that seniors can avail . This program allows an individual to delay their payment of property taxes until the house has been sold. The property taxes accumulate, with an annual interest rate of 4%, but the obligation to settle these taxes arises only upon the transfer of the property. To avail this exemption, the seniors must be at least 70 years old or the surviving spouse of someone previously eligible. Next, they must have been a resident of this state for at least 5 years or owned a house for at least 3 years.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 12', 'Tax Friendliness: Very Tax-friendly', 'Cost of Living Index: 92.4', ""Wyoming, like quite a few other states in the US, does not have an income tax. This means social security retirement benefits and all other sorts of retirement incomes are not taxed in the state. Moreover, sales and property taxes are also some of the lowest in the country, which makes it a very tax-friendly state for seniors. The average effective property rate is 0.6%, which is one of the lowest in the US. Also, sales taxes are low as well. The sales tax rate is 4%, and the combined rate of sales and local sales taxes is 5.36%. Cherry on top, the cost of living in this state is 7.6% lower than the national average. Wyoming's picturesque landscapes, outdoor recreational opportunities, and relatively low cost of living make it an appealing choice for those seeking a peaceful and financially advantageous retirement."", 'Click to continue reading and see the 5 States That Don’t Tax Your Retirement Income.', 'Suggested Articles:', '15 States with the Best Healthcare in the US', '20 Cheapest Places to Retire with Good Healthcare', '15 Worst States to Retire in 2024', 'Disclosure: none. 14 States That Don’t Tax Your Retirement Income is originally published on Insider Monkey.']"

This move is more about gaining the upper hand, or at least a competing hand, in its battle for consumer spending with perennial rival Amazon."", ""Walmart is still the largest U.S. company by sales, but Amazon is closing the gap.

It also owns MGM Studios and and a large streaming network."", ""Amazon's fastest-growing segment, though, is advertising, and that's what Walmart is probably targeting with this acquisition."", 'Amazon has its own smart TV and streaming business, and it recently jumped on the ad-supported tier bandwagon for its Prime streaming network.', ""But it's been using its e-commerce platform as an advertising base. This makes a lot of sense, since third-party sellers can benefit from Amazon's artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and target shoppers who are already looking for these kinds of products. The ad-supported streaming effort is new, but it should add considerable value to the ad business."", ""With the acquisition of Vizio, Walmart can get its own products right in the faces of viewers on Vizio's operating system. It's a well-matched arrangement; Vizio is Walmart's best-selling TV brand, and Walmart is Vizio's largest customer."", ""It's also a means to get into the third-party ad business, which has much higher margins than groceries and can pump up Walmart's profits."", ""Roku has the top streaming operating system (OS) in the U.S. and sells more devices than any rival, including Amazon. It has 75.8 million active accounts with 26.7 billion viewing hours versus 17.9 million Vizio SmartCast active accounts and 5.2 billion viewing hours. According to The Wall Street Journal, Roku's OS has 25% of the U.S. market share, while Amazon has 17% and Vizio 8%."", ""Vizio isn't a threat to Roku, but Roku's stock fell on this news. It seems that investors are intimidated by the Walmart brand moving into Roku's territory, even though Roku is holding its own against Amazon."", ""This isn't the first time Walmart has tried to branch out into new businesses. It was late to the e-commerce game, and the lag may have cost it market share in the long run. It currently accounts for the second-largest e-commerce market share in the U.S., but that's only 6.4%. Amazon accounts for 37.6%, according to Statista."", ""This might not move the needle for Walmart too much, even though it might be a good move to stay relevant.

Morgan Stanley denies it acted unfairly.Morgan Stanley insists that Frasers’ claim is meritless and has promised a vigorous defence.On Friday, Morgan Stanley agreed to hand over numerous documents relating to its $1bn trading dispute with Frasers.The last-minute concession resolved a “long, drawn out and highly contentious” scrap over disclosure that threatened to derail a High Court trial beginning this week.However, it has stoked concern on Mr Ashley’s side that the court will not get all the documents Frasers believes support the alleged unlawful action it claims were taken against it.', 'The dispute relates to bets on Hugo Boss stock made by Frasers. The retail group is seeking €50m in damages after Morgan Stanley closed out its share positions in May 2021, forcing a costly trade transfer to rival bank HSBC.The coming climax of the legal battle sheds what threatens to be an uncomfortable light on the risk processes at one of the largest investment banks in the world.At issue is a margin call of $1bn that Morgan Stanley made against Frasers trades. Mr Ashley’s business was asked to put up the extra funds to backstop its bet on the stock and guard against a potential 400pc move in Hugo Boss’s share price.The margin call was calculated and imposed on Denmark’s Saxo Bank, which dealt with Frasers, in late May 2021 before being passed onto Mr Ashley’s company.Frasers argues that the decision was “arbitrary” and the sum was disproportionate to any risks facing the bank, a position Morgan Stanley disputes.Public legal filings setting out Frasers’ claim as well as documents discussed as part of pre-trial hearings show the case is likely to centre around Morgan Stanley’s approach to the risk management of these trades.At the time of the margin call, Morgan Stanley was confronting $911m (£722m) of losses linked to the collapse of Archegos. The New York family office had months earlier defaulted on margin calls after making doomed bets on American media group ViacomCBS.James Gorman, then Morgan Stanley’s chairman and chief executive, later told CNBC that the Archegos meltdown forced Morgan Stanley to reduce its exposures and reexamine risky “family-office type relationships”.', 'Frasers began building its stake in Hugo Boss in 2019. They were low risk trades, backed up by stock held by Frasers.The Sports Direct-owner believed Hugo Boss was undervalued and hoped the investment could improve its relationship with a key supplier to its House of Fraser and Flannels chains.However, Frasers was unaware that trades placed with Saxo Bank were ultimately executed by brokers at Morgan Stanley.Frasers took out what are known as call options, which are contracts entitling it to buy Hugo Boss stock at a certain price over a certain period. The options were in essence a bet on the stock rising.In the weeks leading up to Morgan Stanley’s margin call, the value of Frasers’ call options soared from zero to more than €200m (£171m).', 'Call logs made public as part of the case suggest some Morgan Stanley bankers were concerned about the time it took to address the risk presented by these trades.In one call between bankers Dominic Freemantle and Jessica Wright, Ms Wright said: “They have a right to say, well, surely, you should have been quicker. Well, hell, it should have been.”Another transcript shows Greg Basso, the Stanley risk manager who triggered the margin call, described the Hugo Boss trades as the bank’s biggest single-stock exposure “by a country mile”.When the matter was flagged to Morgan Stanley’s risk team in New York, they became concerned about Saxo’s underlying client, Frasers, disclosures show.The retailer was referred to internally as an “activist” investor whose boardroom campaigns could threaten Morgan Stanley’s relationships with other corporate clients, according to call transcripts disclosed to the court by Morgan Stanley.', 'Some Morgan Stanley executives also appeared to take issue with Mr Ashley personally. One day after the margin call, Henrik Gobel, Morgan Stanley’s head of global capital markets, described as a “bad guy” and compared him to disgraced former Topshop owner Sir Philip Green.', '“I think he’s kind of s—,” the banker said of Mr Ashley in a call log disclosed in pre-trial proceedings.The remarks came months after Simon Smith, Morgan Stanley’s joint global head of investment banking, allegedly denied Mr Ashley a trading account at the bank because of “animus” towards him. Those comments were made public as part of a legal battle to include Mr Smith’s call logs in disclosure for the case. (Morgan Stanley insists it has full discretion to decide on its customers).Mr Leeson, who worked at Morgan Stanley before joining Barings, suggested the Archegos blowup may have triggered “heightened surveillance [and] heightened scrutiny” across Morgan Stanley.Morgan Stanley’s internal risk controls have been central to pre-trial court hearings. The bank was rebuked for last month after belatedly disclosing an internal policy relating to the margin call, which for years it denied existed.Mr Leeson argued it was “ridiculous” for Morgan Stanley to claim policies weren’t in place, given the preponderance of red tape that has grown up since 2008 governing all aspects of banking.He said: “The regulators have been active since Barings and they’ve been at it again since the global financial collapse in 2008.”A Morgan Stanley spokesman said: “Frasers has never been a client of Morgan Stanley. This claim is contrived and without merit and we will defend it vigorously.”', 'Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Prior to this announcement, Omnicom Group's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business."", 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 28.1%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 33% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', 'The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.60 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 5.8% over that duration. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.', ""Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, Omnicom Group has only grown its earnings per share at 3.7% per annum over the past five years. Omnicom Group is struggling to find viable investments, so it is returning more to shareholders. This isn't bad in itself, but unless earnings growth pick up we wouldn't expect dividends to grow either."", ""In summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity."", 'Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.

In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$8.52b', 'US$10.4b', 'US$12.1b', 'US$14.9b', 'US$17.0b', 'US$19.8b', 'US$21.8b', 'US$23.5b', 'US$25.0b', 'US$26.3b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x25', 'Analyst x24', 'Analyst x17', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 10.32%', 'Est @ 7.91%', 'Est @ 6.22%', 'Est @ 5.04%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% ', 'US$8.0k', 'US$9.1k', 'US$9.9k', 'US$11.4k', 'US$12.1k', 'US$13.2k', 'US$13.6k', 'US$13.7k', 'US$13.6k', 'US$13.3k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$118b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.0%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$26b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.3%) = US$570b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$570b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$289b', 'The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$407b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$290, the company appears quite good value at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Salesforce as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.025. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

If you want to skip our introduction to the current drivers of stock market performance, then check out 5 Best Stocks For Long Term Growth.', 'The stock market in 2024 is characterized by a notably optimistic and forward-looking sentiment compared to the beginning of the previous year. Not only did the U.S. economy avoid tipping into recession, but stock markets also maintained their stability, defying expectations of a significant downturn. In fact, February 2024 witnessed the flagship S&P 500 index achieve a historic milestone by crossing the 5,000-point mark for the first time. This feat underscores the resilience and buoyancy of the stock market, highlighting investor confidence in the economic outlook. Additionally, the NASDAQ Composite, which is heavily influenced by the technology sector, approached its all-time high levels during the same period, further accentuating the positive sentiment in the market, albeit experiencing a slight pullback after the breakout.', 'The mention of ""AI"" among S&P 500 companies increased to 36% from 31% in the third quarter, with the information technology sector retaining its position as the sector with the most companies discussing AI. However, the energy sector experienced the largest increase in companies discussing this technology, as highlighted by David Kostin and his team of strategists at Goldman Sachs. In addition, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the blockbuster chipmaker prominently associated with AI, has witnessed remarkable growth, with its shares surging nearly 50% in the year, following a more than tripling in value in 2023. This surge has propelled NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to become the third-largest U.S. company by market value, surpassing giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).', ""When it comes to stock selection, targeting growth stocks is a common strategy for long-term investors seeking substantial returns. These stocks typically command higher share prices relative to their earnings per share, as they are expected to experience significant growth in the future. One key metric used to identify growth stocks is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares the current share price to the company's earnings per share. A high P/E ratio, especially compared to industry benchmarks, suggests that investors are optimistic about the company's growth potential and are willing to pay a premium for its stock. This optimism is based on the expectation that the company will deliver strong earnings growth in the future, thereby justifying the higher price paid today."", 'Taking a long-term perspective on investment opportunities, growth stocks, particularly within the technology sector, showcase promising prospects.

And Tesla has successfully gotten the ball rolling on the electric vehicle and software-defined car market."", ""Nvidia's explosion onto the scene is thanks to AI infrastructure, a decidedly far more nebulous business to the average person.

Many are scrambling for a cut and minimizing the fact that Nvidia has highly cyclical revenue, as do most research and development-driven semiconductor businesses."", ""The point is, Nvidia stock's latest surge shouldn't be expected to continue going up and to the right forever. It's a safe assumption to make that at some unknown point in the future, there will be a cooldown in AI infrastructure spending. When that happens, expect Nvidia stock to notch a significant sell-off, just like it has in the past."", 'As a longtime happy shareholder of Nvidia, it\'s exciting to see the company\'s rapid progress. But be wary of all the hype as the company\'s status as a leader among the Magnificent Seven heats up. In fact, as wonderful as all these businesses are as top investments, they all go through cycles of growth and periods of more lackluster performance (like Tesla, which hasn\'t been so ""magnificent"" lately).

You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Worst Countries to Live in as an Expat.', 'In the life-changing decision of packing your bags and moving to a new destination, multifarious variables need to be analyzed thoroughly. Migration has been extensive over the past years-- 281 million people were estimated to be living outside their country of origin in 2020. While the drive behind migration could be influenced by multiple forces, the basic intention is to experience a prosperous and higher quality of life in a safe and secure environment, with the least amount of trouble. Therefore, an immigration decision that lands one in the worst countries to live in could create many problems.', 'An analysis of international migrant data reveals that the majority live in countries that can ensure higher opportunities for individuals and families. In 2020, 65% of migrants resided in high-income countries, 31% in middle-income, and 4% in low-income countries. It was also observed that the primary reasons for international migration to high-income countries were labor, family reunification, and education. Global data also indicates that Europe was the leading destination for expatriates in 2020 (87 million), followed by North America (59 million), and North Africa and Western Asia (approximately 50 million). The United States emerged as the country hosting the largest number of international migrants-- 51 million migrants in 2020.', 'With such large numbers of people flowing in and out of countries, immigrant integration has become an international agenda. In fact, first-time migration has been incorporated into the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Thus, while countries worldwide are ensuring expat integration, certain country-specific conditions determine the success or failure of this endeavor. There are some countries that are ideal for relocation (check our article 20 Best Countries to Relocate to for more details) and others that are not such a great fit. Expats evaluate their new destination based on various factors, including but not limited to the quality of life (encompassing safety and security), healthcare and education facilities, ease of settling in, employment opportunities, personal financial conditions, housing, language, and bureaucracy. Therefore, countries that are unable to perform well in these indicators may develop a reputation as the worst choice for expats to live in.', 'For ages, the United States has been a magnet for expats seeking better work opportunities. Renowned tech companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Google-- Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Meta (NASDAQ: META), among others, have attracted foreign talent in large numbers. However, due to the country’s grueling immigration policies and high cost of living, much of this talent is frustrated. Furthermore, substantial layoffs by the tech industry in the recent past have further fueled the fire and even provided an opportunity for other countries to accommodate such a labor force. Canada, for example, has launched its own work permit program to attract these individuals.', 'Tech companies, including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , continue to lay off employees despite better performance. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) laid off 1,900 employees in their gaming division, whereas Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), continuing their spree of layoffs, cut down 180 more employees and shut down two gaming initiatives: Game Growth and Crown Channel. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) also confirmed laying off around a thousand employees.', 'Such working conditions and the rising cost of living due to inflation are causes of concern for expats. Not only will this affect their quality of life, but it will also foster dissatisfaction related to employment.', 'To determine the 15 worst countries to live in as an expat, we relied on data from two different expat indexes: Expat Insider 2023 and Worldwide Expat Index 2023 by William Russell. Expat Insider ranks countries on five essential indexes for choosing a country for relocation: quality of life index, ease of settling index, working abroad index, personal finance index, and expat essentials index. On the other hand, Worldwide Expat Index uses four components: happiness, health, employment, and quality of life. By averaging these two index rankings, we identified countries with an overall worse outlook for expats. A higher average ranking indicates a relatively worse choice of a country. In cases where the average ranking turned out to be the same, we used the Human Development Index (UN 2021) as a tie-breaker. The country with a lower HDI value was considered the worst.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.', 'Let’s take a look at our list of 15 Worst Countries to Live in as an Expat.', 'Expat Insider Index Ranking: 41', 'Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 23', 'Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 32', 'Both indexes present a picture where Denmark excels in the working/employment and quality of life sectors, as well as other expat essentials like the adoption of technological advancements. However, the country performs slightly poorly in the health category, scoring below 4.95 out of 10. Life has also been pointed out as expensive in this country, especially in the housing department. Of even greater importance is the difficulty that expats encounter in settling down in the country due to the inability to make friends with the locals and have a social life. Therefore, overall, Denmark is one of the worst countries to live in as an expat.', 'Expat Insider Index Ranking: 30', 'Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 36', 'Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 33', 'As a land of opportunity, the US has much to offer expats, ranking high on job and work growth possibilities in the country. The happiness score on the Worldwide Expat Index for the happiness factor is also in favor of the country, indicating a general satisfaction that people experience in the US. Nevertheless, the country performs quite poorly in the health section on both indexes, and the overall quality of life index is also not very encouraging. The cost of living is lamented as expensive by expats, which includes amenities such as public transportation, housing, and rent. Thus, while the US does have some attractive benefits that attract expats, caution must also be taken regarding various problems they might face.', 'Expat Insider Index Ranking: 15', 'Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 53', 'Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 34', 'Brazil receives a very low ranking according to the Worldwide Expat Score, consistently performing poorly on all four components of the index, earning a score of only 3.08/10. According to the Expat Insider report, Brazil’s quality of life leaves much to be desired, particularly receiving a low ranking in the safety sector and showing little improvement in the health department. Individuals seeking better work or career opportunities in Brazil would also be severely disappointed. However, the country turns out to be a haven for expats in terms of ease of settlement.', 'Expat Insider Index Ranking: 38', 'Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 31', 'Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 34.5', 'As with other European countries, Belgium ranks fairly high for expats moving abroad with the intention of furthering their careers or finding lucrative jobs. However, the quality of life and health facilities are not attractive selling points for this country. Furthermore, expats have also complained about problems with integration into society. Overall, Belgium emerges as one of the worst countries to live in as an expat.', 'Expat Insider Index Ranking: 32', 'Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 40', 'Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 36', 'While Cyprus has much beautiful scenery to offer its expats, a closer look is necessary at some essential elements before making a relocation decision. Cyprus does not score very well on variables like happiness, health, and employment; therefore, it fares even worse in overall quality of life. Expats have also expressed dissatisfaction with their work culture, and it is expected that people looking for jobs would face hurdles in securing them. Thus, given such scores, Cyprus turns out to be a potentially worse country to live in as an expat.', 'Expat Insider Index Ranking: 13', 'Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 59', 'Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 36', 'Indonesia was observed to perform quite poorly on both indexes, particularly concerning the quality of life and healthcare facilities for expats. While the possibility of good career and job prospects is not entirely ruled out, they are also not very alluring. However, expats are unlikely to face significant social obstacles in settling down in the country, and the cost of living is relatively low. With a combined score from the two indexes, Indonesia does not fare well, earning the 10th position in our list of the worst countries to live in as an expat.', 'Expat Insider Index Ranking: 50', 'Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 24', 'Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 37', 'South Korea has emerged as a challenging country for settling down. Finding friends and maintaining a social life seems difficult, and the country does not offer very good work prospects or much satisfaction with work culture. Expats have also reported financial problems. While the quality of life is not altogether bad, especially concerning healthcare, it is still not very high. South Korea scores quite low on the happiness factor as well, making it one of the worst countries for expats to relocate to.', 'Expat Insider Index Ranking: 46', 'Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 33', 'Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 39.5', 'Portraying a poor quality of life, Malta must be carefully considered before being chosen as a potential relocation country. Expats express dissatisfaction with the housing situation and the financial scenario in the country. The working culture, job prospects, and salaries are also not very attractive. However, Malta does not present too many issues for newcomers in blending in with society.', 'Expat Insider Index Ranking: 35', 'Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 46', 'Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 40.5', 'For expats planning on moving to Poland, the language barrier is a real problem that must be accounted for before making this decision. This could also be the contributing factor in making Poland a tough country for finding friends and setting up a social life. However, working conditions are fair enough in the country, and the quality of living, as well as the cost of living, is mediocre.', 'Expat Insider Index Ranking: 34', 'Worldwide Expat Index Ranking: 48', 'Insider Monkey Average Ranking: 41', 'Hungary ranks low on healthcare facilities, and the overall quality of life is not very high. Expats have reported trouble settling in the country and finding local friendly faces. Language is one of the biggest problems faced by expats. The low score on the working abroad index also does not bode well for future immigrants. However, most expats have given positive feedback regarding financial aspects, including the cost of living and disposable income.

Every share of a dividend stock you buy adds to your passive income. It's like paving a road to financial freedom brick by brick, your destination being the point where your dividends can pay all your living expenses."", ""The brick-by-brick point is important, though. Dividend investing doesn't need a huge lump of cash from Day 1. It can easily be accomplished with consistent, small investments made over time."", ""If you have $400 available that isn't needed for monthly bills or to pay down short-term debt, there are numerous high-quality dividend stocks you can buy and hold today. Here are three favorites that should work for all investing styles."", ""Don't assume a stock paying a dividend can't deliver monstrous total returns. Sneaker and sports apparel company Nike (NYSE: NKE) has paid and raised its dividend for 22 consecutive years. Over the past 22 years, the stock has returned nearly 1,800%, outperforming the S&P 500 roughly 3-to-1. It turns out that companies that make enough money to share their earnings with investors and still grow their businesses are nifty stocks to buy and hold."", ""Nike's business isn't very complicated. It makes shoes and sports apparel, which anyone can do. However, you can't replicate Nike's brand appeal; the Swoosh is legendary in global sports culture. Nike has built a competitive advantage by tying itself to global icons, from NBA legends like Michael Jordan and LeBron James to soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo. Consumers want Nike's products because of that association."", ""It's been a winning formula for decades, and that's poised to continue. Nike has evolved with the retail landscape, shifting toward e-commerce by building a direct-to-consumer business that moves nearly as much product as it does wholesale. Analysts predict Nike will grow earnings by almost 15% annually over the long term, which means investors can expect more dividend increases and price appreciation over the coming years. The one potential downside to all the stock price appreciation Nike has seen is that the current dividend is somewhat low at 1.4%. Expect that number to improve as time goes by."", ""Healthcare has been and always will be a core pillar of society, so it's hard to go wrong buying Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). The company is a two-headed healthcare giant consisting of a pharmaceutical arm and a diverse portfolio of medical products, ranging from spine robotics to contact lenses.

Analysts believe Johnson & Johnson's earnings will grow by an average of 5% to 6% annually, so consider making the stock one you buy, hold, and add to regularly. Its reliability makes it an outstanding foundation for any portfolio."", ""Who doesn't love getting huge dividend checks?

However, during periods of high inflation, such as the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s, when inflation rates averaged 5% or more, dividends accounted for an even larger portion, around 54% of the total return. This insight came from Naveed Rahman, who serves as a co-manager of the Fidelity Equity-Income Strategy. The Fidelity report further elaborated on the performance of dividend stocks during inflationary periods, highlighting that during the 1930s and 2000s when the stock prices of the S&P 500 declined, dividends nearly offset those losses. Moreover, in the 1940s and 1970s, characterized by significant inflation spikes, dividends contributed substantially to the S&P 500's return, accounting for 65% and 71% respectively."", ""Dividend-paying stocks have become a cornerstone of many individual investor portfolios due to their ability to generate substantial income over time. This income component is essential as it can significantly contribute to the overall return on investment, helping investors achieve the necessary portfolio growth to meet their financial goals. A study conducted by Eagle Investment Management sheds light on the income potential of dividend-paying stocks. The study compared the income generated by a theoretical $1,000,000 investment made on December 31, 2012, in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, consisting of companies that have consistently increased their dividends for 25 years, with the broader S&P 500 Index, assuming reinvestment of dividends. According to the report, the initial investment of $1,000,000 in 2012 in the dividend aristocrats would have generated an income of $93,212 by 2022. In contrast, the income from the same investment in the S&P 500 during the same period would have been $55,726. This stark difference highlights the significant income potential offered by dividend aristocrats compared to the broader market index. Although historical, this example serves to demonstrate the importance of not just prioritizing dividends but also considering the growth of dividends. This dual focus is crucial for enhancing a portfolio's income stream gradually over time."", 'Throughout the years, stocks belonging to companies that begin and consistently increase their dividend payouts have shown superior performance compared to the overall market. Conversely, stocks of companies that reduce or fail to pay dividends have notably underperformed. According to findings from a report by RMB Capital, from 1972 to 2018, dividend-growing companies and those initiating dividends delivered an average annual return of 9.62%, while stocks of companies cutting dividends experienced a negative return of 0.79%.

With this, figuring out the best fintech stocks to buy may be top-of-mind right now.', 'Although many popular and more under-the-radar names have performed extremely well in recent months, for those with a long time horizon, several of them are arguably still strong investment opportunities.', 'Capitalizing on trends such as the digitalization of banking and payments, as well as emerging areas of finance like cryptocurrencies, the highest-quality stocks in this category are both benefiting from recent developments, and have the strong potential to keep on growing at an above average pace.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'While many, if not most, of these best fintech stocks to buy may appear pricey based on traditional valuation metrics, strong fundamentals, coupled with macro trends that bode well for growth stock valuations (namely, the prospect of falling interest rates), making them worthy of a buy at current prices.', 'Source: www.hollandfoto.net / Shutterstock.com', 'Since last fall, there’s been an 180-degree shift in sentiment for Adyen (OTCMKTS:ADYEY). Shares in the Netherlands-based digital payment processing platform operator have more-than-doubled off their lows. At first, ADYEY’s rebound was fueled by a positive response to announced sweeping changes in the company’s strategy.', 'Then, more recently, ADYEY stock has surged, following the release of quarterly results that show the strategy chance is already starting to pay off, as revenue has continued to grow at a satisfactory clip, and earnings are coming in well-above prior expectations.', 'Following this impressive comeback, shares are trading at a high valuation (52.3 times forward earnings). I wouldn’t rule out the potential for Adyen to continue soaring higher on positive surprises. At least, that’s the view of TD Cowen’s Bryan Bergin. Bergin last week upgraded shares, citing the potential for both future revenue growth and margins to exceed current consensus.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/whiteMocca', 'Since I last recommended Fiserv (NYSE:FI) as one of the best fintech stocks to buy, shares in this payment processing company have continued to perform well.', 'Following a nearly 25% run-up between October and December, the stock has climbed even higher. Fiserv has, and continues to, hit new all-time highs.', 'But even after an extended period of above-average price performance, make no mistake. FI stock remains more-than reasonably priced. At the current prices, Fiserv is trading at approximately 16.7 times forward earnings. That’s on the low end of fintech stock valuations.', 'As noted previously, given the company’s forecasted growth over the next few years, a re-rating to a forward multiple in the 20s isn’t out of the realm of possibility. Per Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev, the strength of Fiserv’s North American merchant business (such as its Clover platform) points to continued overall success for the company, and for shares.', 'Source: Joyseulay / Shutterstock.com', 'Shift4 Payments (NYSE:FOUR) is another digital payments stock that has benefited from a sharp rebound in sentiment.', 'Shares in this payments processor, which focused on sectors like e-commerce and hospitality, have bolted from the mid-$40s to the high-$70s since last November.', 'Yet despite this strong rally, it’s not as if the valuation of FOUR stock has all of a sudden gotten out of hand. Shift4 Payments currently trades for 26.9 times forward earnings. While this valuation doesn’t exactly put FOUR in undervalued territory, the stock may have ample room to expand this multiple.', 'Sell-side earnings forecasts for the company spread widely. If the U.S. economy continues to experience a soft landing (good for transaction growth), and if interest rates come down (good for both growth and FOUR’s valuation), earnings may just well hit the high end of forecasts (between $3.50 and $4 per share).', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock', 'Among the best fintech stocks to buy that have performed well but remain cheap, Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) fits very well within this category. Like the names discussed above and below, shares in this payment technology firm have also rallied strongly since last fall.', 'However, even after the big rally, GPN stock is still trading at only 13 times forward earnings. Admittedly, it makes sense why Global Payments currently trades at a discount. As a Seeking Alpha commentator recently argued, there are concerns as to whether earnings growth will keep up with revenue growth.', 'Global Payments’ dividend growth potential may also be limited by its over-leveraged balance sheet.', 'Still, while some analysts are more mixed about GPN’s prospects, analysts at Evercore ISI are bullish about the company’s pivot towards high-growth areas of the payments sector, as well as a ramp-up in cost synergies related to last year’s acquisition of EVO Payments.', 'Source: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com', 'If you’ve looking to buy and hold a high-quality/blue-chip among fintech stocks, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is a sound choice. This is also the case for shares in this payment technology giant’s chief competitor, Visa (NYSE:V).', 'Both MA stock and V stock have sound track records in terms of earnings, dividends, and share price growth. MA may not have a high dividend yield (0.58%), but this payout has increased by an average of 17% annually over the past five years.', 'As I have argued previously about both stocks, thanks to the global switch from cash to digital payments, both companies are well-positioned to sustain earnings growth in the 15-20% range. Although both names trade at rich valuations, assuming current payment technology trends persist, so too could these high forward multiples. (31.8 times forward earnings for MA, 27.8 times forward earnings for V).', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'If you’re looking for a long-term growth play, SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) is one the best fintech stocks to buy. Although this diversified digital-first financial services and technology firm has traded sideways in recent months, more stellar price performance may lie ahead.', 'Why? Last quarter, SoFi reported its first quarter of GAAP profitability.', 'With much of the fintech firm’s operating costs being fixed in nature, there’s big potential for this company, and for SOFI stock, to benefit from operating leverage. Revenue continues to grow at a solid pace (34% last quarter, for example).', 'However, thanks to the impact of operating leverage, the resultant impact on incremental earnings growth could be substantial.', 'Sell-side forecasts call for SOFI’s earnings to increase by nearly fourfold next year, and to more-than-double during 2026, to 51 cents per share. Not too shabby, for a growth stock currently trading for around $8.15 per share.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'With Block (NYSE:SQ) shares already bouncing back 72% from their lows, you may think it’s already too late to make the Square, CashApp, and Afterpay parent a buy.', 'Yet while SQ is once again pricey (at 34.6 times forward earnings), and in fact pricier than its main peer PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), among the two established fintech stocks, SQ may be the better buy.', 'The PayPal turnaround remains a work-in-progress. Not to mention, highly uncertain. In contrast, between the potential for growth synergies between its business units, as well as Square’s high exposure to cryptocurrencies (which have recently come back in vogue), Square appears better-positioned to continue meeting/beating expectations.', 'In turn, this points to SQ stock outperforming PYPL stock in the near-to-medium term.

Past distributions do not necessarily guarantee future ones, but Northern Trust's payout ratio of 59% is a good sign as this means that earnings decently cover dividends."", 'The next 3 years are set to see EPS grow by 47.9%. Analysts forecast the future payout ratio could be 45% over the same time horizon, which is a number we think the company can maintain.', 'The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.24 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $3.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.2% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.', ""Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Over the past five years, it looks as though Northern Trust's EPS has declined at around 5.1% a year. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. Earnings are predicted to grow over the next year, but we would remain cautious until a track record of earnings growth is established."", ""Overall, we think Northern Trust is a solid choice as a dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't raised this year. The earnings coverage is acceptable for now, but with earnings on the decline we would definitely keep an eye on the payout ratio. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio."", 'Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Given that earnings are not growing, the dividend does not look nearly so attractive. Businesses can change though, and we think it would make sense to see what analysts are forecasting for the company.

And based on how shares are performing, investors weren't pleased with the numbers. Revenue was better than expected, but management warned of ongoing industry headwinds this year."", 'The latest update proves again that Roku is dealing with an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. And this will continue to impact the digital advertising market in the near term.', ""Nonetheless, the business is still well positioned to gain from the growing number of cord-cutters. But is Roku the best streaming stock to buy right now? Let's take a closer look."", ""The best way to understand Roku's business model is to think of it as a three-sided platform, consisting of viewers, content providers, and advertisers. Viewers use the service as a way to enjoy all of their favorite movies and TV shows in one elegant interface. And advertisers who want to target a large, highly-engaged streaming audience can do so with Roku. "", 'While the company does generate revenue from the sale of its hardware devices, including smart TVs and media sticks, the vast majority of its top line comes from the platform segment. This advertising and subscription revenue made up 86% of the total in 2023. ', 'With the leading smart-TV operating system in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, Roku has 80 million active accounts that streamed 29.1 billion hours of content last quarter. ', 'What places Roku in an advantageous position is that it can ride the wave of streaming entertainment, while other companies spend tens of billions of dollars to produce this content. And as marketing dollars transition from traditional cable TV to connected TV, the business will benefit from greater digital advertising spend as well.', ""Shares have soared 77% since the beginning of 2023, but they're still 85% below their all-time high. They also trade at a price-to-sales multiple of 2.9, just a fraction of the historical average of 10.1. This beaten-down valuation helps support the argument that Roku might be the best way to play the streaming trend."", ""However, investors can't ignore the dominant force in the industry: Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). After adding a better-than-expected 13.1 million net new subscribers last quarter, the company now has more than 260 million paying customers. This makes Netflix the largest streaming service on the planet with 2023 revenue totaling $33.7 billion."", ""I mentioned above how Roku largely avoids the massive spending that other streaming companies have to deal with. While it's true Netflix plans to spend a whopping $17 billion on content this year after shelling out the same amount in 2023, this company has an advantage thanks to its huge scale. Netflix has no problem spending this much money year in and year out because its user base is so big."", 'Management expects Netflix to report an operating margin of 24% in 2024 with free cash flow expected to total $6 billion. This puts the business in a league of its own in terms of financial strength. The success of paid sharing initiatives and the new ad-based tier are already supporting improved growth, and this can lead to even greater profitability over time.', 'This direct-to-consumer streaming service, which is dominating the industry, also qualifies as a top streaming stock. In other words, investors who want more exposure to this secular trend could consider owning shares of both Netflix and Roku.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Netflix wasn’t one of them.

This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 3.8%."", ' See our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group ', ""We aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Prior to this announcement, Public Service Enterprise Group's dividend was only 40% of earnings, however it was paying out 154% of free cash flows. The business might be trying to strike a balance between returning cash to shareholders and reinvesting back into the business, but this high of a payout ratio could definitely force the dividend to be cut if the company runs into a bit of a tough spot."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 25.2% over the next year. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 57%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.', 'The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $1.44, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.28. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 4.7% a year over that time. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.', ""The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. We are encouraged to see that Public Service Enterprise Group has grown earnings per share at 5.3% per year over the past five years. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting."", 'Overall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.', ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

They pay above-average-yielding dividends that grow each year. ', ""Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), and Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) stand out to three Fool.com contributors for their incredible ability to pay dividends. Here's why they think these are great dividend stocks to buy right now and hold for a potential lifetime of income. "", ""Reuben Gregg Brewer (Enterprise Products Partners): According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), two of the most important monitors of the energy industry, demand for natural gas and oil will remain robust until at least 2050. That's as far as their current projections go, and they include a rapid increase in the demand for clean energy. Simply put, energy transitions take a very long time, and for the next quarter of a century or so, oil and natural gas will still be vital to the world economy. It seems highly unlikely that demand for oil and gas will fall off a cliff after 2050."", ""This is the backdrop that supports North American midstream giant Enterprise Products Partners' ability to keep paying distributions to unitholders. Currently, the yield is an attractive 7.6%. That's backed by an investment grade-rated balance sheet, 25 years of annual distribution increases, and distributable cash flow that covered the distribution by 1.7 times in 2023. It is in rock-solid shape."", 'But the biggest thing to like about Enterprise is its portfolio of vital energy infrastructure, which includes energy pipelines, storage, transportation, and processing assets. It charges fees for the use of these assets, which help to move oil and natural gas around the world. As long as the world still needs oil and natural gas, the world still needs Enterprise. And that means hefty distributions for years to come.', ""Matt DiLallo (NextEra Energy): NextEra Energy has done an incredible job of growing its dividend over the years. The utility has increased its payout annually for more than a quarter century. Those haven't been token raises to keep its streak alive. The company has grown its payout at an 11% compound annual rate over the last decade even as it has grown into one of the country's largest utilities. It has increased its earnings faster than its rivals, fueled by its focus on Florida and renewables. "", 'The company is in an excellent position to continue growing its 3.3%-yielding dividend at a healthy rate. It expects to deliver around 10% annual dividend growth through at least this year. The utility could continue increasing its payout at a solid pace in the future. NextEra Energy expects to grow its earnings at or near the top end of its 6% to 8% target range through at least 2026 while maintaining its strong financial profile. ', 'Meanwhile, it should have plenty of power to keep growing beyond 2026, fueled by the growing demand for clean energy. Estimates suggest that the U.S. needs to invest $4 trillion through 2050 to decarbonize its economy. That should give it plenty of opportunities to invest in wind, solar, battery storage, and electricity transmission projects. On top of that, it could capitalize on emerging opportunities, like green hydrogen. ', ""NextEra Energy's early focus on capturing the massive clean energy opportunity has helped power outsized dividend growth over the years. This megatrend should continue powering its dividend in the decades to come. That makes it an ideal dividend stock to buy and hold for a lifetime of growing income."", 'Neha Chamaria (Brookfield Infrastructure): Brookfield Infrastructure proved its mettle yet again earlier in February with its numbers for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. The infrastructure giant, which owns and operates steady cash-flow generating assets across sectors like utilities, transportation, midstream energy, and data infrastructure, grew its funds from operations (FFO) by 10% in 2023. Organic growth was 8%, and the company sold mature assets worth nearly $1.9 billion to deploy the proceeds into new investments.', 'All in all, 2023 was a solid year for Brookfield Infrastructure. Even better, the company expects 2024 to be an even bigger year. That makes this stock an incredibly solid buy now for investors who love dividends as they can safely expect a good dividend raise from the company while enjoying a big yield.', ""Brookfield Infrastructure has a solid dividend track record -- it increased its dividend for the 15th consecutive year this month, rewarding its shareholders with a 6% dividend raise. That's in line with the company's long-term target of growing its dividend by 5% to 9% every year. Shares of both the partnership and corporation currently yield 5%."", 'Higher interest rates are a headwind for Brookfield Infrastructure, but the company has continued to deliver so far as it remains laser-focused on recycling capital, replacing mature assets across its portfolio with better-return acquisitions that should boost its cash flows. With its dividend growth and yield combined, Brookfield Infrastructure will likely generate double-digit returns for shareholders every year. As for its stock price, while it should be driven by earnings and dividend growth, external catalysts, like a fall in interest rates, could be an even bigger catalyst for the stock.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Enterprise Products Partners right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Enterprise Products Partners, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Enterprise Products Partners wasn’t one of them.

However, during periods of high inflation, such as the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s, when inflation rates averaged 5% or more, dividends accounted for an even larger portion, around 54% of the total return. This insight came from Naveed Rahman, who serves as a co-manager of the Fidelity Equity-Income Strategy. The Fidelity report further elaborated on the performance of dividend stocks during inflationary periods, highlighting that during the 1930s and 2000s when the stock prices of the S&P 500 declined, dividends nearly offset those losses. Moreover, in the 1940s and 1970s, characterized by significant inflation spikes, dividends contributed substantially to the S&P 500's return, accounting for 65% and 71% respectively."", ""Dividend-paying stocks have become a cornerstone of many individual investor portfolios due to their ability to generate substantial income over time. This income component is essential as it can significantly contribute to the overall return on investment, helping investors achieve the necessary portfolio growth to meet their financial goals. A study conducted by Eagle Investment Management sheds light on the income potential of dividend-paying stocks. The study compared the income generated by a theoretical $1,000,000 investment made on December 31, 2012, in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, consisting of companies that have consistently increased their dividends for 25 years, with the broader S&P 500 Index, assuming reinvestment of dividends. According to the report, the initial investment of $1,000,000 in 2012 in the dividend aristocrats would have generated an income of $93,212 by 2022. In contrast, the income from the same investment in the S&P 500 during the same period would have been $55,726. This stark difference highlights the significant income potential offered by dividend aristocrats compared to the broader market index. Although historical, this example serves to demonstrate the importance of not just prioritizing dividends but also considering the growth of dividends. This dual focus is crucial for enhancing a portfolio's income stream gradually over time."", 'Throughout the years, stocks belonging to companies that begin and consistently increase their dividend payouts have shown superior performance compared to the overall market. Conversely, stocks of companies that reduce or fail to pay dividends have notably underperformed.

That historic rally -- which was driven by soaring sales of data center GPUs for processing artificial intelligence (AI) tasks -- left Nvidia's semiconductor rivals in the dust."", 'One of those rivals was Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), which was more valuable than Nvidia nearly five years ago. Back in May 2019, Qualcomm had a market cap of $104 billion, while Nvidia was worth $103 billion. But today, Qualcomm is only worth $174 billion, making it less than a 10th as valuable as Nvidia.', ""Qualcomm, which drove Nvidia out of the mobile chipmaking market in 2014, is still heavily dependent on the cyclical sales of smartphones. Meanwhile, Nvidia expanded beyond its core gaming GPU business and ramped up its sales of higher-end GPUs for data centers. That forward-thinking strategy enabled it to capitalize on the rapid growth of the AI market, which kicked into high gear as generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT gained more users."", ""Could Qualcomm stage a fierce comeback over the next few years and become an exciting growth stock like Nvidia again? Or will it become a slower-growth chipmaker like Texas Instruments, the type of investment that's owned for stability and income instead?"", ""Qualcomm produces mobile system on chips (SoCs), which bundle together CPUs and GPUs for smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. It also sells stand-alone baseband modems to smartphone makers like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) that don't use its mobile SoCs. Like Nvidia, Qualcomm is a fabless chipmaker that outsources its production to third-party foundries."", ""Qualcomm was once the world's top mobile SoC maker, but it lost its crown to Taiwan's MediaTek over the past three years. Major smartphone makers like Apple, Samsung, and Huawei have also been developing their own first-party mobile SoCs."", 'Those threats, along with the cyclical nature of the smartphone market, drove Qualcomm to develop more chips for the automotive and Internet of Things (IoT) markets. In fiscal 2023 (which ended last September), it generated 85% of its revenue from its chipmaking division -- but handset chips still accounted for 74% of that total.', ""The remaining 15% of its revenue came from its licensing division, which leverages its wireless patents to take a cut of every smartphone sold worldwide -- even if they don't use Qualcomm's chips. This business operates at much higher margins than its chipmaking segment, but it's been repeatedly challenged by handset makers and government regulators claiming its royalties and licensing fees are too high."", ""Qualcomm's revenue only rose 12% in fiscal 2020 as the pandemic disrupted the semiconductor sector, but surged 55% in fiscal 2021 and 32% in fiscal 2022 as those headwinds dissipated and new 5G handsets hit the market."", ""But in fiscal 2023, Qualcomm's revenue fell 19% due to the 5G upgrade cycle ending, macro headwinds throttling sales of new handsets (especially in China), and continuing struggles against MediaTek in the low-to-mid-range market. Its sales of industrial IoT chips also declined as the macro environment drove companies to rein in their spending. Its double-digit growth in automotive chip sales failed to offset all of that pressure."", ""Analysts expect Qualcomm's revenue to rise 6% in fiscal 2024 and 8% in fiscal 2025 as the smartphone market gradually recovers, it ramps up its sales of IoT and automotive chips, and the macro picture improves. But looking further ahead, Apple -- which accounted for more than 10% of Qualcomm's revenue in fiscal 2023 -- could eventually replace the chipmaker's baseband modems with its own first-party modems after 2026."", ""Qualcomm's loss of Apple -- along with pressure from competition, the commoditization of the smartphone market, and the slow expansion of its IoT and automotive chipmaking businesses -- will likely cause it to expand at a much slower pace than Nvidia for the foreseeable future. On the bright side, analysts expect Qualcomm's EPS to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026 as it continues to streamline its spending and repurchase more shares."", ""Qualcomm's stock looks cheap at 16 times forward earnings and pays an attractive forward yield of 2.1%.

(NASDAQ:EXPE) announced its full-year 2023 results earlier this month, and markets did not take kindly to developments in its earnings, with the stock dropping by 18% the day after earnings were announced. Management warned that the tailwinds in travel demand seen by the company so far in 2023 could be moderating globally in 2024, especially within air travel. But what really seems to have blindsided investors was news about Expedia's CEO, Peter Kern, stepping down from the company to be replaced by long-time veteran Ariane Gorin."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with EXPE.', 'While the news of executive succession could cast doubts over the strategic vision of Expedia, I think the stock now offers an attractive entry point given the recent developments after reviewing management commentary and the earnings report.', 'Expedia is a travel technology company that operates some of the most-visited online travel properties in the world, such as the eponymous Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Vrbo and Trivago, to name a few. The company has made a few changes to the way it operates, diversifying its revenue collection models in a post-pandemic world driven by higher interest rates and uncertain macroeconomic outlooks.', ""Most of the company's prior focus would be on an agency-based model where Expedia acted as an agent in the transaction between the traveler and the travel merchant without collecting any upfront fees. The company also operated a merchant-based model, where it facilitated end-end transactions, including collecting payments upfront, while also offering travel merchants value-added services under the Expedia Traveler Preference program. Over time, the merchant model and business-to-business segments have been the fastest-growing revenue contributors. In addition to growing quickly, Expedia's business-to-business segment also has higher Ebitda margins."", 'In 2023, the travel company\'s gross bookings continued to decelerate to 10% growth on a year-over-year basis. Expedia had seen some strong tailwinds from ""revenge travel"" trends as travelers globally resumed their travel plans with Covid-lockdowns fully easing. However, those post-pandemic tailwinds that Expedia witnessed in the first quarter of 2023 started to fade last year, with bookings slowing from 20% year over year in the first quarter to 6% in the fourth quarter. The softness in travel demand was most notable in air ticket bookings, which grew only 3% year over year in the last quarter of 2023, as can be seen in the table below.', ""However, the strength of its business-to-business segment continues to be underappreciated by most investors, which grew by a stellar 33% in 2023 versus 2022. Since the pandemic lockdowns, Expedia has doubled down on its focus to make the B2B business more meaningfully representative of its overall travel business, and the results appear to be paying off handsomely. As can be seen below, Expedia's B2B segment is not only outpacing the overall revenue growth of the company, it also offers higher Ebitda margins."", ""Earlier in the year, management explained that the B2B business benefits from economies of scale due to the technical foundations that were already laid out by Expedia, courtesy of its business-to-consumer segment. Here is some of management's commentary from Expedia's first-quarter earnings call:"", '""I think the B2B business has been growing terrifically, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. We haven\'t had to do any big technical migrations. In fact, we\'ve added to the capabilities over the last couple of years. And we\'ve seen the benefits of that in many of our business lines.""', ""As the year progressed, management continued to reap the high-margin and high-growth benefits from the B2B business, and I believe they will continue to do so. In my opinion, this is one of the reasons why Expedia's board announced the CEO succession plan since the new incoming chief executive, Ariane Gorin, has led the B2B business through its most pivotal time in history during the pandemic. This development, in my opinion, is actually good news that positions Expedia for a new chapter of growth."", ""On the earnings front, Expedia's adjusted Ebitda of $532 million grew 19% year over year, outpacing the 10% revenue growth that we saw in an earlier table. This was a new record for the company in terms of adjusted Ebitda, which grew 19%, while Ebitda margins expanded by 130 basis points to 18.50%. Fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $1.72, 1.40% better than what analysts expected. The strong display of earnings allowed the company to record $1.80 billion in free cash at a free cash margin of 14%, higher than their pre-pandemic five-year FCF margins of around 11%. Management also mentioned that they have used their free cash to repurchase around $2 billion in their own stock throughout the year."", ""In terms of Expedia's debt standing and liquidity levels, the company's gross leverage ratio has reduced to 2.30, which is still off from its long-term target of 2. The company is carrying a significant amount of debt at the moment of $6.30 billion. Although the company has a net cash position of $4.30 billion, I believe management is actively working to reduce debt toward long-term targets. The company holds all its debt in the form of senior notes, and 44% of its debt should mature over the next two years, allowing the company to get closer to its long-term leverage ratio."", ""As mentioned earlier, travel demand has been softening from a robust first-quarter 2023. Management expects that a softening in travel demand will persist in the first quarter of this year, given that pandemic-induced travel tailwinds will fade. In addition, severe quality issues in Boeing's Max 9 airplanes that Alaska Airlines witnessed midair at the start of the year have further dampened travel demand in this quarter, according to Expedia. United Airlines echoed similar sentiments in its earnings call last month as well. Given these updates, management still expects revenue to grow in line with the growth rates seen in 2023, which should be around 10%. This is almost three times higher than the projected revenue growth in the S&P 500, as per FactSet."", ""While projecting earnings, management said it expects a one-time hit of $100 million as they move into the last stages of initiatives to streamline operations and several backend technology platforms. Hence, the company is also projecting Ebitda margin expansion similar to the margin expansion that was seen in 2023. Given that margins expanded by 0.8% to 20.9% , I can expect Ebitda margins of about 21.50% in 2024. This means Expedia's Ebitda is expected to grow by 13.30%, which is better than the 10.9% expected in the S&P 500. At these growth rates, I think a forward price-earnings ratio of 18 to 21 is justified. With Expedia currently trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of just 11.70, there is significant room for upside this year."", ""The risks of investing in Expedia currently involve a larger industry-wide travel weakness that may persist throughout the year. The company has already mentioned it expects the weakening trends seen in the latter half of last year to persist in the first quarter. Sustained geopolitical tension and uncertain macroeconomic environments are the most likely culprits here. I think Expedia's first-quarter outlook, along with the CEO transition announcement, caused pessimism, sparking a sell-off in the company's stock."", 'However, I am still optimistic about travel trends improving as we progress through Memorial Day in the U.S. Multiple industry reports from Skift andDeloitte expect tourism to moderate but still stay strong throughout the year. In fact, Deloitte also mentioned that corporate travel spending in the U.S. is still likely to finally pass the pre-pandemic line. This plays well into the B2B segment strength that I mentioned earlier.', ""After carefully evaluating Expedia's earnings and perusing management commentary, I am convinced of the attractive entry points Expedia offers today. The severe pessimism in the stock is currently unwarranted, and with significant room for expansion, I think Expedia could be the contrarian trade of the year."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

On April 18, 1955, Albert Einstein departed this world after a blood vessel near his heart ruptured. When offered the option of surgery, Einstein gracefully declined, declaring, ""I choose to depart on my terms. Prolonging life artificially lacks elegance. I have fulfilled my purpose; it is time to bid adieu."" Following a post-mortem examination, Einstein\'s remains were cremated, and his ashes scattered in a location undisclosed. The globe mourned the loss of a visionary. In adherence to his wishes, his office and abode remained untouched by the shadow of memorials.', ""Albert Einstein, born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany, and passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, U.S., was a renowned physicist whose research extended across various fields, from quantum mechanics to theories concerning gravity and motion. Following the publication of several seminal papers, Einstein embarked on a world tour, delivering lectures about his groundbreaking discoveries. In 1921, he was honored with the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the photoelectric effect. Einstein's most famous equation, E = mc^2, asserts the equivalence of energy and mass, illustrating that they are interchangeable forms of the same entity. His contributions also include the development of the theory of special and general relativity, which built upon and expanded previous theories proposed by Isaac Newton more than two centuries earlier."", ""Albert Einstein's scientific discoveries continue to resonate and shape various industries in profound ways, even in the modern era. His famous equation, E=mc², establishing the equivalence of mass and energy, remains fundamental in understanding nuclear reactions, driving advances in nuclear power plants and applications in atomic technology. These principles are pivotal in the ongoing developments of nuclear technologies that impact the world today."", 'Moreover, in the laser industry, Einstein\'s pioneering work on stimulated emission forms the theoretical basis for lasers, as epitomized in the acronym ""Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation"" (LASER). The foundational concepts he laid out have propelled the widespread integration of lasers across industries such as communication, manufacturing, medicine, and scientific research, revolutionizing diverse fields with their versatile applications.', ""Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, introduced in 1915, significantly influences space-related technologies by providing a more precise comprehension of gravity. This enhanced understanding plays a vital role in space exploration, satellite communication, and precision-related applications like GPS systems, contributing to the success and advancement of space missions and positioning systems in the contemporary space industry."", ""While not directly attributed to Einstein, the principles of quantum mechanics, which somehow stem from his early work in quantum theory, have profoundly impacted the economy by influencing the development of modern computing and artificial intelligence. Quantum computing, leveraging quantum phenomena to enhance computation efficiency in specific tasks, represents a groundbreaking advancement made possible by the foundational quantum principles originally explored by Albert Einstein. These technological innovations continue to shape and redefine various industries, demonstrating the enduring impact of Einstein's scientific legacy on the contemporary world and its economy."", 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a significant trend in the technology landscape, with its transformative potential becoming increasingly evident. Recent years have witnessed notable advancements in AI, once confined to the realms of science fiction, now being realized in practical applications. Experts recognize AI as a pivotal factor for enhancing productivity, offering new growth opportunities, and revolutionizing traditional work practices across various sectors. By 2030, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to add a significant economic value of up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy, surpassing the combined current output of China and India. This substantial contribution is expected to be derived from $6.6 trillion in enhanced productivity and $9.1 trillion from consumption-side impacts.', 'Moreover, research has demonstrated a robust correlation coefficient of 0.60 between Total-Factor-Productivity (TFP) and long-term economic growth in developed economies. Among the three primary components of TFP, technological output stands out as a key factor. This highlights the pivotal influence of technological advancements, including advancements in artificial intelligence, on the trajectory of long-term economic growth. As artificial intelligence progresses and enhances productivity, its effect on Total-Factor-Productivity gains greater importance, aligning with the ongoing trend seen in advanced economies.', 'Another prominent industry within the world of science is the spacecraft industry, market growth in which is driven by a variety of factors, such as technological advancements, scientific exploration, commercial prospects, and geopolitical interests. Progress in space technology, especially in propulsion systems and miniaturization, is enhancing spacecraft capabilities, leading to the creation of more efficient and adaptable vehicles. Scientific missions directed towards exploring celestial bodies and commercial ventures like Earth observation, communication satellites, and space tourism are key contributors to the demand for spacecraft. Furthermore, the participation of private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin is further fueling interest in both government and commercial sectors. Projections suggest that the global spacecraft market is anticipated to grow from USD 6.69 billion in 2023 to nearly USD 11.63 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.34% during the period of 2024 to 2032.', 'Let us have a look at some of the major contributors in the realm of science in today’s world.', ""Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a pharmaceutical company committed to transforming scientific discoveries into treatments that improve the lives of individuals globally.

A massive hole opened up in the side of the plane, minutes into a flight. Wind and noise filled the cabin, clothes and phones were ripped from passengers and hurled into the void. The metal of airplane seats twisted towards the opening.', 'It was an extremely lucky day.', 'Because for the 171 passengers, four flight attendants and two pilots on board Alaska Airlines flight 1282 who experienced all of that on January 5, it could have been so much worse.', '“It’s fortunate that nobody died and there were not more serious injuries,” Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, told CNN after touring the aircraft shortly after the incident.', 'The preliminary report on the incident was released earlier this month, and one of the most alarming notes in a long litany of them was just how many flights the Boeing 737 Max 9 involved in the fateful incident took before the door plug blew off because it left the factory missing crucial bolts needed to keep it in place.', 'The plane, tail number N704AL, had already been flying for Alaska for 10 weeks, going on 153 flights. Unbeknownst to passengers and crew that flew on it, and seemingly even the factory that built it, the terror that occurred was seemingly inevitable.', 'Every time a modern commercial airliner goes up in the air, it ever-so-slightly expands and contracts, like a balloon being inflated and deflated. Each time it goes up, the cabin is pressurized so that the humans inside can breathe air thick with oxygen, unlike the thin, cold air just outside the aircraft’s aluminum skin. Every time the plane pressurized and de-pressurized, there was an opportunity for the door plug to come undone. There were, accordingly, at least 153 opportunities.', '“I think we were fortunate the door plug stayed in place as long as it did with the hardware missing,” said Anthony Brickhouse, a crash investigator and professor of aviation safety at Embry Riddle University.', 'Here’s the ways in which Alaska Air — and Boeing — got lucky to have the plane finally develop problems when and how it did on January 5.', 'Seats 26A and 26B were the seats closest to the door plug. They were both also unoccupied during the flight, two of only seven open seats on the nearly full plane.', 'The force of air when the hole opened up was enough to rip much of the seating material off of the seats and twist them towards the opening. A passenger sitting in the window seat, and possibly even the middle seat, might have been pushed through the opening by the force of the relatively high-pressure air on the inside rushing to the low-pressure environment at altitude on the outside.', 'That’s what happened on a Southwest flight in 2018, when part of an engine cowling broke free and shattered a window. The passenger sitting next to that window, Jennifer Riordan, 43, was expelled through the broken window. While other passengers were able to bring her back inside, she died as a result of blunt impact trauma of the head, neck and torso.', 'It was also fortunate that there were no infants or toddlers who were being held by their parents in their laps near the opening. Alaska, as is the case with most airlines, allows “lap infants” for passengers up to their second birthday. Brickhouse said had there been a lap infant in that row, there’s a good chance they would have been lost through the opening.', '“There’s been an effort to not allow lap children,” he said. “Why is it that you’re required to be buckled in a car, but mommy and daddy can hold you on a flight? Hopefully it will highlight need to stop that.”', 'The door plug came out at 16,000 feet as the plane was still climbing. That means two things:', '1) All the passengers were supposed to still be belted into their seats and not moving around the cabin.', '2) There was still enough air to breathe as passengers got their oxygen masks on.', 'Both would not have been the case had the door plug come out at the cruising altitude above 30,000 feet.', '“At cruising altitude, you’d have quite a bit different effect on the passengers,” said Mike Dostert, a technical advisor for the Foundation for Aviation Safety and a former engineer with both Boeing and the FAA. “Air is so thin, particularly for eldery and younger passengers, you can end up with brain damage.”', 'And that also could have caused more damage to the fuselage itself said Brickhouse.', '“The higher you go, the faster you go, the more profound the structural failure is going to be,” he said. “In a rapid decompression at cruising altitude, it’s going to be a much more violent situation.”', 'Records show that the plane made 22 of its 153 flights before January between Hawaii and the mainland. Those were flights that put it over the ocean for more than five hours, as much as 10 hours for those from Anchorage to Honolulu.', 'Had the door blown out half-way through any of those flights, making it back to the nearest airport would have been a much more challenging endeavor than it was on January 5, when it was able to return to the airport in Portland within minutes of the incident.', '“Obviously if this plane had been halfway between the mainland and Hawaii, there would have been the question — are we pressing forward, are we turning around?” said Brickhouse.', 'The plane descending to a lower altitude, which it would have done on a prolonged flight, would have helped with the cabin pressure, and with the temperature in the cabin. But it would have forced the plane to burn far more fuel as it flew through the much denser atmosphere lower to the ground. It would have been depending on fuel reserves onboard the plane to be able to complete the flight.', 'The real nightmare scenario for experts is what happened to the door plug once it blew away. It apparently blew clear of the plane and did not cause any additional damage.', 'But if the plug had gone straight back, it could have hit the rudder or the vertical stabilizers on the tail, which are crucial to the plane flying straight, level and under control. Aircraft that have lost these pieces have been known to crash, like Japan Air Lines Flight 123, which in lost its vertical stabilizer in 1985 and hit a mountain. There were only four survivors and more than 500 who died, some when a rescue was delayed.', '“I think they’re lucky it didn’t hit the fuselage or the tail,” said Joe Jacobsen, another former engineer for Boeing and the FAA.', '“It’s pretty random where it went, whether it goes up, down or straight back. It depends on the orientation of the plane when it blew out,” he said. “And then there’s the question of how it hits the tail, what damage it does, whether it’s a glancing blow or a direct hit.”', '“That’s the catastrophic scenario. They could have lost the whole airplane.”', 'The Boeing 737 Max 9 that were grounded after the incident have all been inspected and returned to service. Alaska CEO Ben Minicucci said in an interview that the airline found loose bolts on many of the planes.', 'And the NTSB’s Homendy told CNN the day after the agency released its preliminary finding that while she is confident that the planes are now safe, that “Of course, something like this can happen again.”', 'Minicucci apologized to passengers who were on the flight shortly after it happened.', '“My heart goes out to those who were on this flight – I am so sorry for what you experienced,” he said.', 'The airline referred further questions about the incident to the NTSB.', 'Asked about the incident and what might have happened, Boeing referred to comments by CEO Dave Calhoun, who apologized and expressed horror about the incident in a message to Boeing employees four days after the flight.', '“When I got that picture … I didn’t know what happened to whoever was supposed to be in that seat in the airplane,” he said. “I got kids, I got grandkids and so do you. This stuff matters, everything matters, every detail matters.”', 'The NTSB has yet to assess fault or blame for the missing bolts that had been needed to keep the door plug in place. But in comments to investors in late January, Calhoun accepted responsibility for Boeing.', '“We caused the problem, and we understand that,” he said in a call after reporting the latest quarterly loss at the company. “Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.”', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

However, during periods of high inflation, such as the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s, when inflation rates averaged 5% or more, dividends accounted for an even larger portion, around 54% of the total return. This insight came from Naveed Rahman, who serves as a co-manager of the Fidelity Equity-Income Strategy. The Fidelity report further elaborated on the performance of dividend stocks during inflationary periods, highlighting that during the 1930s and 2000s when the stock prices of the S&P 500 declined, dividends nearly offset those losses. Moreover, in the 1940s and 1970s, characterized by significant inflation spikes, dividends contributed substantially to the S&P 500's return, accounting for 65% and 71% respectively."", ""Dividend-paying stocks have become a cornerstone of many individual investor portfolios due to their ability to generate substantial income over time. This income component is essential as it can significantly contribute to the overall return on investment, helping investors achieve the necessary portfolio growth to meet their financial goals. A study conducted by Eagle Investment Management sheds light on the income potential of dividend-paying stocks. The study compared the income generated by a theoretical $1,000,000 investment made on December 31, 2012, in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, consisting of companies that have consistently increased their dividends for 25 years, with the broader S&P 500 Index, assuming reinvestment of dividends. According to the report, the initial investment of $1,000,000 in 2012 in the dividend aristocrats would have generated an income of $93,212 by 2022. In contrast, the income from the same investment in the S&P 500 during the same period would have been $55,726. This stark difference highlights the significant income potential offered by dividend aristocrats compared to the broader market index. Although historical, this example serves to demonstrate the importance of not just prioritizing dividends but also considering the growth of dividends. This dual focus is crucial for enhancing a portfolio's income stream gradually over time."", 'Throughout the years, stocks belonging to companies that begin and consistently increase their dividend payouts have shown superior performance compared to the overall market.

If you want to skip our introduction to the current drivers of stock market performance, then check out 5 Best Stocks For Long Term Growth.', 'The stock market in 2024 is characterized by a notably optimistic and forward-looking sentiment compared to the beginning of the previous year. Not only did the U.S. economy avoid tipping into recession, but stock markets also maintained their stability, defying expectations of a significant downturn. In fact, February 2024 witnessed the flagship S&P 500 index achieve a historic milestone by crossing the 5,000-point mark for the first time. This feat underscores the resilience and buoyancy of the stock market, highlighting investor confidence in the economic outlook. Additionally, the NASDAQ Composite, which is heavily influenced by the technology sector, approached its all-time high levels during the same period, further accentuating the positive sentiment in the market, albeit experiencing a slight pullback after the breakout.', 'The mention of ""AI"" among S&P 500 companies increased to 36% from 31% in the third quarter, with the information technology sector retaining its position as the sector with the most companies discussing AI. However, the energy sector experienced the largest increase in companies discussing this technology, as highlighted by David Kostin and his team of strategists at Goldman Sachs. In addition, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the blockbuster chipmaker prominently associated with AI, has witnessed remarkable growth, with its shares surging nearly 50% in the year, following a more than tripling in value in 2023. This surge has propelled NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to become the third-largest U.S. company by market value, surpassing giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).', ""When it comes to stock selection, targeting growth stocks is a common strategy for long-term investors seeking substantial returns. These stocks typically command higher share prices relative to their earnings per share, as they are expected to experience significant growth in the future. One key metric used to identify growth stocks is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares the current share price to the company's earnings per share. A high P/E ratio, especially compared to industry benchmarks, suggests that investors are optimistic about the company's growth potential and are willing to pay a premium for its stock. This optimism is based on the expectation that the company will deliver strong earnings growth in the future, thereby justifying the higher price paid today."", 'Taking a long-term perspective on investment opportunities, growth stocks, particularly within the technology sector, showcase promising prospects.

Investors haven't been happy with slowing growth amid macro uncertainty."", ""It's not all bad news. There are lots of reasons to appreciate this magnificent growth stock, but bullish investors can't ignore a critical risk factor."", 'Higher interest rates and ongoing inflationary pressures have negative impacts on a business like PayPal. The electronic payments platform skews toward discretionary purchase activity, so when consumers cut back on spending, PayPal feels the pain. Revenue rose 8.5% in 2022 and 8.2% in 2023, much slower growth rates than in previous years.', ""However, those growth rates are still healthy, all things considered. And it's worth pointing out that the total payment value (TPV) PayPal processed last year of more than $1.5 trillion was 22% higher than it was two years ago. The platform is seeing greater usage, which is obviously a positive sign since the company earns revenue primarily from transaction fees."", ""PayPal currently has 426 million active accounts, which consist of both individuals and merchants. Serving both sides of a transaction has developed powerful network effects, which is the company's economic moat. The fact that PayPal is accepted in more than 200 countries and regions makes the service extremely valuable for consumers. And because hundreds of millions of individuals use PayPal, it's almost a no-brainer for a merchant to accept this as a method of payment. Consequently, the network gets stronger over time."", ""We can't ignore how profitable of an enterprise this is.

The advantage the tech giant has is that it controls one of the most popular mobile operating systems, so it can put its payment mechanism ahead of rivals.

On April 18, 1955, Albert Einstein departed this world after a blood vessel near his heart ruptured. When offered the option of surgery, Einstein gracefully declined, declaring, ""I choose to depart on my terms. Prolonging life artificially lacks elegance. I have fulfilled my purpose; it is time to bid adieu."" Following a post-mortem examination, Einstein\'s remains were cremated, and his ashes scattered in a location undisclosed. The globe mourned the loss of a visionary. In adherence to his wishes, his office and abode remained untouched by the shadow of memorials.', ""Albert Einstein, born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany, and passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, U.S., was a renowned physicist whose research extended across various fields, from quantum mechanics to theories concerning gravity and motion. Following the publication of several seminal papers, Einstein embarked on a world tour, delivering lectures about his groundbreaking discoveries. In 1921, he was honored with the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the photoelectric effect. Einstein's most famous equation, E = mc^2, asserts the equivalence of energy and mass, illustrating that they are interchangeable forms of the same entity.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off.

If you would like to skip our analysis of the factors impacting the aviation industry, you can go to the 5 Most Expensive Countries to Fly to.', 'After a brief dip during the pandemic, flight prices have soared globally, with a recent report showing an increase of 31% in average flight prices over the last two years. However, the cost of flying to different regions has not increased in a uniform manner. Figures from the report reveal that flight prices have risen the most in Northern Europe as well as the Mediterranean and Asian regions. Each region has expensive and inexpensive countries to visit. For example, the Netherlands is amongst the most expensive countries to visit in Europe, while South Korea is one of the most expensive countries to visit in Asia. \xa0Airline ticket prices are rising in the USA also. The consumer price index for airline tickets rose by 25% during 2022, which was the highest increase to date, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.', 'One of the most significant factors influencing airfares is the cost of jet fuel, which currently accounts for roughly 31% of airline operating expenses. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), jet fuel prices rose by 92% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and global supply chain disruptions. IATA has also forecasted the average fuel price to be $113.8 per barrel in 2024. This will lead to a total cost of $281 billion for airlines, which can translate to higher ticket prices for passengers.', 'Labor shortages within airlines and airports are also driving up operating costs. According to projections from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the aviation sector is expected to require 480,000 new technicians for aircraft maintenance and around 350,000 pilots by the year 2026. The scarcity of skilled labor is resulting in issues such as flight delays, cancellations, and low passenger satisfaction. Moreover, this issue is likely to be further aggravated since 50% of pilots, particularly captains, are expected to retire within the next 15 years. To respond to the shortage, airlines are significantly increasing the salaries of pilots. Beyond the cost side, the demand equation is also fueling higher airfares. According to IATA, 4.7 billion people will travel in 2024, which is higher than the pre-pandemic level of 4.5 billion in 2019. This imbalance between booming demand and a limited supply of resources is pushing prices upwards.', 'Furthermore, the aviation industry is beginning to take initiatives for a greener future by utilizing sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). However, SAFs are currently 3 times more expensive than traditional jet fuel. Moreover, $5.1 trillion dollars will be required to achieve the goal of zero emissions by 2050. The higher price of SAFs is translating into increased ticket prices for passengers who prioritize airlines focusing on sustainability. As SAF production scales up and costs decrease, this impact on ticket prices is expected to lessen, but currently, it contributes to pricing pressures.', 'The trend of rising airfares is expected to continue in 2024. Global airfares are predicted to increase by 3% - 5% in 2024 as airlines such as United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) struggle with high fuel costs, incorporation of sustainable aviation fuels and an aging fleet.

In fact, February 2024 witnessed the flagship S&P 500 index achieve a historic milestone by crossing the 5,000-point mark for the first time. This feat underscores the resilience and buoyancy of the stock market, highlighting investor confidence in the economic outlook.

In addition, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the blockbuster chipmaker prominently associated with AI, has witnessed remarkable growth, with its shares surging nearly 50% in the year, following a more than tripling in value in 2023.

One key metric used to identify growth stocks is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares the current share price to the company's earnings per share. A high P/E ratio, especially compared to industry benchmarks, suggests that investors are optimistic about the company's growth potential and are willing to pay a premium for its stock. This optimism is based on the expectation that the company will deliver strong earnings growth in the future, thereby justifying the higher price paid today."", 'Taking a long-term perspective on investment opportunities, growth stocks, particularly within the technology sector, showcase promising prospects.

The massive disparity translates to plenty of room for more digital payment expansion that Visa can tap into. Therefore, steady investments in digital payment technology backed by data security services should allow Visa to deliver the steady growth numbers that investors have come to expect.', ""Visa has always stood out in the highly competitive payment solution segment owing to its ability to attract and retain customers. Revenue has continued to grow due to the company's successful client acquisition, strategies and renewal of existing partnerships."", 'China has become one of the critical markets for payment technology companies as its payments grow at a compound annual rate of 8.39%. Consumer spending on Visa cards in the country has been resilient and continues to gather steam.', 'In addition, the massive growth of the Chinese e-commerce sector has also translated into booming business for Visa. The rapid growth as part of the digital payment revolution has allowed the company to increase its market share in the country and, in return, boost its revenues.', 'China is not the only frontier that affirms Visa growth metrics and long-term prospects. As the world evolves into a cashless society, exponential growth in mobile payments has helped support its growth rate. The global mobile payment market was valued at about $3 trillion in 2023 and is expected to be worth $18.84 trillion by 2030.', 'The growth is attributed to mobile payments, which enable instant money transfers as a secure substitute for cash-based transactions. Visa Checkout is an easy and smart online checkout program that has allowed payment technology to tap into the massive opportunities around mobile payments. The payment scheme enables customers to make payments online via any device in collaboration with some of the biggest payment networks, including Apple Pay.', 'Visa is also benefiting from a fundamental change in consumer behavior. The acceptance of digital payments, with the proliferation of mobile devices and merchants accepting mobile payments, has translated to increased transactions that the company processes. Hence, as digital payments replace cash in various transactions, Visa should be able to generate significant fees for processing multiple transactions.', 'Visa continues to experience high teen growth in the number of transactions it processes by expanding its global network of partners and extending its current agreements with the likes of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).', 'Its massive reach in the electronic payment sector is affirmed by the fact the company has over 4.3 billion cards globally. In addition, its network and solutions are used by over 130 million merchant locations across the globe and handle over 276.3 billion transactions.', 'The payment giant has inked strategic partnerships that are strengthening its competitive edge. Late last year, it expanded its foothold in the Chinese market following a deal with a fintech division of Tencent Financial Technology.', ""The strategic partnership will enable Weixin users to receive inbound remittances in their digital wallets. The partnership is expected to expand Visa Direct's network reach to more than 1 billion Weixin users in one of the world's largest inbound remittance markets. Visa has set its sights on the Chinese market at a time when digital wallets are the fastest-growing financial instruments and are expected to exceed 5 billion by 2026."", 'Source: Paymentscardsandmobile', ""The strategic partnership with Tencent Financial Technology builds on previously announced collaborations with Thunes and TerraPay, which have also implemented Visa Direct capabilities. The strategic partnerships have increased the company's reach to over 8.5 billion endpoints, including over 3 billion cards, 3 billion accounts and 2.5 billion digital wallets."", ""Additionally, as per the personal finance expert, Enoch Omololu, Visa's collaborations are pivotal for its penetration into fast-growing markets, facilitating digital wallet transactions worldwide and bolstering its presence in Africaa region of significant growth potential, highlighted by a $1 billion investment commitment. Hence, these moves are critical to Visa's long-term strategy, enhancing its leadership in the digital payments industry by leveraging emerging fintech networks and expertise."", ""Finally, in Canada, Visa is partnering with Plug and Play, the venture capital and accelerator company expected to entrench its reach in the country's fintech market. The country's fintech industry is in a robust growth phase, with a compound annual growth rate of 25% through 2029."", ""Regulatory hurdles pose the biggest challenge to Visa's achievement of its growth rates. The electronic payment landscape faces increased regulatory scrutiny and tight consumer protection regulations that could affect the company's operations."", ""As a dominant player commanding over 40% of the market, Visa will always be at the center of regulatory challenges. Any changes on the regulatory front could affect the company's dominance in the sector, which in turn could affect its performance. For example, the enactment of Europe's Second Payment Services Directive, which permits third-party payment providers to access customer data, poses a significant threat to Visa's intermediary role in payment processing."", ""In the U.S., the passing of the FedNow Service introduced a real-time payment system that reduces credit risks for financial institutions, and its inclusion of banks and unions on all levels poses significant risks. The new service is a competitor for Visa's network, which could inhibit its online payment and merchant service revenue."", ""Amid a challenging macroeconomic environment fuelled by high interest rates, Visa's core business has held firm, as depicted by robust revenue and earnings growth. The company has navigated the challenging environment nicely, with the stock gaining over 40% over the past year. Solid underlying fundamentals at the back of expansion in China, strategic partnerships and the introduction of new payment solutions affirm the company's growth metrics and long-term prospects."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Three of them dominate the payments landscape and should be on every investor's radar. Let's take a closer look at American Express (NYSE: AXP), Visa (NYSE: V), and Mastercard (NYSE: MA)."", ""American Express is the third-largest holding for Berkshire, which has a position valued at $32 billion. Berkshire has a massive 21% stake in the credit card leader, and it's not hard to figure out why."", 'Amex fits a lot of the criteria the Oracle of Omaha seeks in his investments.

Moreover, by connecting merchants and individuals, the business benefits from powerful network effects.', ""Buffett likes to own stocks over an indefinite holding period. The above traits demonstrate that it's not hard to have confidence that Amex has staying power. "", 'The stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19, which is in line with its trailing-10-year average. This seems like a reasonable entry point for prospective investors because Amex continues to experience positive momentum.', ' It posted revenue (net of interest expense) of $60.5 billion in 2023, up 14% year over year.

These two businesses might deserve those price tags, thanks to their high quality."", ""Unlike American Express, Visa and Mastercard don't lend capital to consumers. Instead, they partner with various banking institutions that must find customers, run credit checks, handle payments, and take on the default risk. As a result, you won't see them earning interest income."", 'But similarly to Amex, Visa and Mastercard operate the so-called payment rails that connect consumers and merchants, allowing them to transact all over the world.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed.

However, after investigating Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger."", ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business.

Around five years ago the returns on capital were 13%, but since then they've fallen to 9.3%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments.

The last dividend was quite easily covered by Genuine Parts' earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business."", 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 18.9%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 36%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', 'The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $2.15 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $4.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 6.4% per annum over that time.

We'll use ROE to examine Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC), by way of a worked example."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' See our latest analysis for Exelon ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Exelon is:', '8.4% = US$2.1b ÷ US$25b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.08."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Exelon has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Electric Utilities industry average (8.9%)."", ""That isn't amazing, but it is respectable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Exelon."", ""Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking."", ""Exelon clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.70. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it."", ""Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

Welcome to our fourth quarter and year end investor update. I'm excited for today's call as we closed out 2023 in strong fashion and our future continues to look very bright. And I look forward to highlighting why that is on today's call. Turning to Slide 4. I'm very proud of what our PPL team was able to accomplish in 2023. In short, it was a year of challenges met and promises kept. Most importantly, we delivered electricity and natural gas safely and reliably to our more than 3.5 million customers. This included top quartile T&D reliability at each of our utilities, including record reliability for our companies in Kentucky and Rhode Island and top decile performance in Pennsylvania."", 'Our generation reliability in Kentucky was among the very best in the nation. We achieved all this despite heightened storm activity in each of our service territories. At the same time and despite over $0.10 per share impact from mild weather and storms, we delivered on every one of our financial commitments to our shareowners. Namely, we achieved ongoing earnings of $1.60 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our ongoing earnings forecast by $0.02 and delivering over 8% growth from pro forma 2022. We achieved this through our strong focus on operational efficiency and outperformance in key areas that Joe will cover in his financial review. We also executed $2.4 billion in planned capital spend on time and on budget to advance a reliable, resilient, affordable, and cleaner energy future.', 'We exceeded our annual O&M savings target for 2023 through our strong enterprise-wide focus on technology and business transformation, achieving $75 million in savings from our 2021 baseline, reinforcing our continuous improvement mindset and putting us solidly on track to deliver our targeted $175 million in O&M savings by 2026. These operational and financial achievements were matched by strong results elsewhere in the business that position us for future success. Underpinned by sound planning and effective management of regulatory proceedings, we secured constructive regulatory outcomes in Kentucky and Rhode Island. In Kentucky, we secured approval for about $2 billion in generation replacement investments as part of our CPCN process that concluded in November of last year.', ""The KPSC's decision ensures that we can continue to meet our customers' future energy needs safely, reliably, and affordably, while advancing a cleaner energy mix in the state. And in Rhode Island, we secured approval of our first infrastructure, safety, and reliability plans since acquiring Rhode Island Energy. In addition, we received the green light to deploy advanced metering functionality across Rhode Island, as we lay a foundation for a smarter, more resilient, more reliable, and more dynamic electric grid capable of supporting the state's leading climate goals. Finally, we continue to provide a smooth and seamless transition to PPL ownership for our Rhode Island Energy stakeholders, completing all planned 2023 integration milestones and keeping us on track to exit our remaining transition service agreements with National Grid in mid-2024."", ""These achievements are a direct result of our focus on execution, our disciplined investment strategy, our ability to adjust when challenges arise, our experienced leadership team, and clarity of purpose across PPL as we pursue our Utilities of the Future Strategy. Looking ahead, we recognize we still have room to improve as we pursue our vision to be the best utility company in the US. And in 2024, we're determined to make continued progress as we seek to maximize long-term value for both our customers and shareowners. Turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced the results of our updated business plan, which extends our projected growth outlook through at least 2027. In connection with this update, today, we announced our 2024 ongoing earnings forecast range of $1.63 to $1.75 per share."", ""The midpoint of this range, $1.69 per share, represents 7% growth from our 2023 ongoing earnings per share target, consistent with our long-term growth targets. In addition, today, we announced a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.2575 per share. This represents a 7.3% increase from the current quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share and aligns with our commitment to dividend growth in line with our EPS growth targets. We've extended our 6% to 8% annual EPS and dividend growth targets through at least 2027 based off the midpoint of our 2024 earnings forecast range. In addition to today's updated growth forecast, our updated capital plan includes $14.3 billion from 2024 to 2027 to strengthen grid reliability and resiliency and advance a cleaner energy mix without compromising on affordability."", ""The new plan is expected to drive average annual rate base growth of 6.3% through 2027, up from the prior growth rate of 5.6%. We plan to fund these additional investments supported by our exceptional balance sheet as our credit metrics remain well within our targets throughout the planned period without the need for equity issuances through at least 2027. As I highlighted in my recap of 2023, we've made outstanding progress towards our multiyear target of at least $175 million in annual O&M savings by 2026. Based on the progress we made last year, we remain solidly on track to deliver our 2024 targeted savings of $120 million to $130 million. In terms of rate case timing in the plan, we do not anticipate any base rate case filings in 2024 in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, or Rhode Island."", 'Looking beyond 2024, our current projections would have us filing a base rate case a bit sooner in Kentucky than previously anticipated due to several factors, including the CPCN decision and additional capital investment needs on the T&D side of the business. Currently, we believe the earliest we would file a rate case in Kentucky will be in the first half of 2025. For Rhode Island, the earliest we would file is late 2025, which is consistent with the prior plan. Finally, in Pennsylvania, recall that we have not been in for a base rate case since 2015 and we have no plans to go in again before 2026 at the earliest. The DSIC mechanism in Pennsylvania has operated as designed to support long-term infrastructure investment between rate cases.', 'We do see an increased need to invest more to improve reliability on the distribution system and filed with the Pennsylvania PUC a request to modify our long-term infrastructure improvement plan, or LTIP, which includes an increase in planned DSIC eligible investment over a five-year period. We are considering filing a waiver request with the Pennsylvania PUC in the near future, requesting modifications to the DSIC mechanism to support accelerated replacement of aging infrastructure. As always, our focus is on maintaining affordability for our customers. And we will continue to evaluate the need for future rate cases based on a variety of factors, including capital plans, interest rates, market conditions, and regulatory lag. Turning to Slide 6.', ""Our updated plan and business outlook supports our Utilities of the Future Strategy, which is core to everything we do. What does that mean to us? It means updating our design criteria and continuing to harden our transmission and distribution systems to protect against climate change and keep our systems and data secure again cyber threats. It means expanding our industry-leading use of technology, including smart grids, automation, data analytics, AI, and technologies that haven't even been invented yet to build a self-healing grid. It means investing in R&D to drive innovation to advance technologies that can be scaled safely, reliably, and affordably to meet our customers' evolving energy needs and to actually achieve net zero. Like the carbon capture project that was awarded a $72 million DOE grant at our Cane Run combined cycle plant in Kentucky."", 'At the same time, it means expanding transmission and incorporating grid-enhancing technologies to connect more renewables and improve reliability for our customers; advancing a cleaner generation mix, while keeping energy safe, reliable and affordable; expanding our ability to reliably manage two-way power flows on the distribution network as we connect significant more distributed energy; driving operational efficiencies to support an affordable clean energy transition; partnering with our customers and state and local officials to enable growth and economic development in our communities; and lastly, expanding self-service options for our customers using digital tools to enhance the customer experience. Turning to Slide 7. As you can hear, creating the Utilities of the Future requires change across our entire business, and it requires significant investments to support a net zero economy.', ""The industry and others are projecting a 200% to 300% increase in electricity demand, which will require additions of reliable generation unless we see unprecedented amounts of energy conservation. At the same time, aging fossil fuel plants in this country are being retired very rapidly without replacements of reliable, dispatchable generation capacity. And considering that fossil fuel generation represents more than 50% of our total capacity in the US, that presents a potentially major problem if this transition is not managed appropriately. The math simply doesn't add up when we don't have proven, scalable technology currently available to actually achieve net zero carbon emissions that customers can afford. Most technologies used in our industry took 40 years to commercialize from the demonstration phase."", 'We need to cut that timeframe in half, at least to meet net zero by 2050 targets, especially as we think about the big four new potential technologies, nuclear SMRs, carbon capture and sequestration, long-duration energy storage, and hydrogen. In the meantime, we need to leverage commercially viable resources that exist today to reduce our carbon footprint, while maintaining reliability. Those that are dispatchable, can ramp up and down quickly and are vital to balancing the gaps left on the system by intermittent renewables. That is why natural gas generation is the key to achieving deep decarbonization in this country and it actually allows us to deploy more renewables than we would otherwise be able to do because of the reliability benefits of natural gas.', ""In a nutshell, this is what makes the energy transition such a challenge being able to deliver the clean energy future in a way that maintains reliability and affordability for our customers. However, with every challenge brings opportunity. And that's why we know our Utilities of the Future strategy is the right approach for this dynamic energy landscape. It's why our generation transition plan in Kentucky is reasoned and delivered and ensures we can maintain the reliability and resiliency of our customers and public officials demand. We actually need to figure out a way to do the same in deregulated markets like PJM and ISO New England. And it's why becoming more efficient is such a critical component of our strategy because for every dollar of O&M we can take out of the business, we can spend $8 on capital without impacting the customer bill."", ""The energy transition simply won't happen if customers cannot afford it. This is how we will achieve our long-term vision and how we intend to enhance the value we deliver for all stakeholders. It requires us to lead from the front and that is exactly what we've been doing and what we will continue to do in 2024 and beyond. Turning to Slide 8 and our priorities for 2024. In addition to advancing our Utilities of the Future Strategy, our 2024 priorities also include achieving at least the midpoint of our earnings per share forecast, executing $3.1 billion in infrastructure investments to maintain safe, reliable, and affordable energy for our customers and modernize the grid. Delivering on our 2024 O&M savings targets as we deploy scalable technologies across our portfolio, take advantage of economies of scale created by our centralization efforts, and continue to leverage data analytics to reduce costs and optimize asset planning and maintenance."", ""Finally, we need to complete our integration of Rhode Island Energy and exit all remaining tranches and service agreements with National Grid. Bottom-line, we're eager to showcase PPL's strengths once again in 2024, and we are poised to lead on these very significant issues facing our industry. We have tremendous conviction in our strategy and business plan and in our ability to execute them both and we look forward to once again delivering on our commitments to customers and shareowners. That concludes my business and strategic update. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update."", ""Joe Bergstein: Thank you, Vince and good morning everyone. Let's turn to Slide 10. PPL's fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $0.15 per share compared to $0.26 per share in Q4 2022. We recorded special items of $0.25 per share during the fourth quarter, primarily due to a settlement agreement with Talen Energy Corporation as well as integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. Adjusting for these special items, fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.40 per share, an improvement of $0.12 per share compared to Q4 2022. The primary drivers of this increase were returns on capital investments and lower O&M expenses, partially offset by lower sales volumes, primarily due to the continued mild weather experienced in the fourth quarter of 2023."", 'In total, weather was a $0.02 per share drag on our Q4 results compared to our plan. On an annual basis, our 2023 GAAP earnings were $1 per share. Adjusting for $0.60 per share of special items recorded throughout the year, our 2023 ongoing earnings were $1.60 per share. This compares to $1.41 per share of ongoing earnings for 2022 or a 13% increase from those prior year results. And as Vince noted, we delivered our earnings target for 2023, exceeding the $1.58 per share midpoint of our earnings forecast. Our teams did a fantastic job of executing our plan, while remaining steadfast in achieving our financial goals, which enabled us to offset the adverse impacts of significant unfavorable weather and storm activity, while maintaining reliability for our customers.', ""2023 demonstrated our ability to deal with adversity and still achieve our commitments to both customers and shareowners, adding to our confidence in our ability to achieve our earnings targets. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the fourth quarter on Slide 11. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results increased by $0.04 per share compared to the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by lower O&M and higher transmission revenue, partially offset by lower sales volumes and higher interest expense. Our Kentucky segment results increased by $0.06 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The improvement in Kentucky's results were primarily driven by lower O&M expense, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to the mild weather."", 'Our Rhode Island segment results increased by $0.02 per share. This increase was primarily driven by higher rider revenue from capital investments, partially offset by higher interest expense. Finally, results at corporate and other were flat compared to the prior period, primarily due to lower income taxes, offset by higher O&M expense. Moving to Slide 12, 2023 was a pivotal year for PPL following our strategic repositioning, which we completed in 2022. Heading into the year, we set our 2023 earnings forecast range with a midpoint of $1.58 per share, representing 7% growth from the 2022 pro forma midpoint of $1.48 per share, which reflected a full year of earnings from Rhode Island Energy. And for the second consecutive year, we outperformed our own targets, beating our earnings forecast by $0.02 and achieving over 8% growth for the 2022 pro forma forecast midpoint.', 'This was a significant achievement given the abnormally mild weather and storms we experienced, which impacted results by more than $0.10 per share. As I said numerous times over the past year, we were confident that our team would overcome those challenges and deliver on our commitments to both our customers and shareowners. This included several areas of excellent execution and constructive regulatory mechanisms, including prudent management of costs without sacrificing reliability, recovery of critical infrastructure investments in PA through the DSIC mechanism, outperformance and integration of Rhode Island Energy, and optimization of our financing plan. Looking at 2024, the midpoint of our earnings forecast range is $1.69 per share, which again represents 7% earnings growth from the midpoint of our 2023 forecast.', ""Since we initially communicated our earnings growth targets to investors, we remain on that consistent trajectory, while extending that growth further into the future. And we've done that again today with our extension of the 6% to 8% growth targets to 2027, supported by an updated capital investment plan, which I'll discuss in more detail in a couple of slides. Moving to Slide 13. On this slide, we've provided a walk from our 2023 actual results of $1.60 per share to the midpoint of our 2024 forecast, highlighting the projected drivers of the year-over-year increase by segment. Our Pennsylvania segment results are expected to increase by $0.05 per share in 2024, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments in transmission, higher sales volume and lower O&M, partially offset by less distribution rider recovery and higher interest expense."", 'We project our Kentucky segment results to increase by $0.07 per share in 2024, primarily driven by higher sales volumes due to the expected return to normal weather. Our Rhode Island segment results are expected to increase by $0.02 per share in 2024 compared to our 2023 results. This is primarily due to higher capital investment rider revenue and lower O&M, partially offset by higher depreciation expense. Finally, we project our corporate and other results to decrease by $0.05 per share in 2024, primarily due to higher interest expense and other factors that are not individually significant. Turning to Slide 14. Over the next four years, we have planned capital investments of $14.3 billion, focused on delivering superior service and enhancing the overall customer experience, while maintaining an affordable price.', 'This includes advancing industry-leading grid modernization, expanding and hardening our transmission networks, improving the safety of our natural gas networks, and implementing our approved generation replacement plan in Kentucky. This plan represents a $2.4 billion increase in capital investments compared to the prior four-year plan. Approximately $1 billion of that increase is expected to occur in the 2024 to 2026 period. Most of that increase is projected to be in Pennsylvania and Kentucky as we continue to modernize our electric transmission and distribution systems and enhanced reliability and resiliency. We continue to expect significant investment needs until the end of this decade as reflected on our 2027 forecast. This includes nearly $1.2 billion in Pennsylvania, of which approximately 65% is transmission investment under FERC formula rates; $1.8 billion of investment in Kentucky, primarily related to further enhancements on the electric and gas T&D systems and to execute our generation replacement plan; and it includes over $700 million of investment in Rhode Island as we continue to prepare the grid for significant levels of clean energy resources and enhance resiliency against increasingly severe storms, while continuing our focus to maintain a safe and reliable gas network by replacing leak-prone pipe.', 'Turning to Slide 15. These additional capital investments are projected to lead to annual rate base growth of 6.3% from 2023 to 2027. This compares to annual rate base growth of 5.6% in our prior plan period from 2022 to 2026. As you can see on the chart, two-thirds of our rate base relates to investments in our electric T&D networks, given the significant needs as we strengthen and modernize the grid. Importantly, while we project our total rate base to grow, rate base related to coal generation continues to decline from 2023 to 2027. In fact, the percentage of our total rate base related to coal generation is expected to be less than 12% by the end of 2027, down from about 18% today. And based on this trajectory, we expect this to continue to decline and be under 10% by the end of the decade.', 'In summary, the result of our updated plan narrows the gap between our projected rate base growth and earnings growth targets as investment needs continue to increase with the evolving energy landscape. As such, we continue to be very focused on affordability and maximizing every dollar we spend. Our earnings growth in the near-term continues to be driven by the combination of rate base growth and operating efficiencies that we believe maximizes value for both customers and shareowners. Moving to Slide 16. Today, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.2575 per share. This results in an annualized dividend of $1.03 per share compared to our prior annualized dividend of $0.96 per share. The 7.3% increase aligns with our projected 2024 forecasted earnings growth and long-term EPS growth targets.', ""We continue to expect future dividend growth to align with our earnings growth targets. The updated dividend remains within our targeted dividend payout range of 60% to 65% based on the midpoint of our 2024 earnings forecast. The combination of PPL's EPS growth and dividend yields provides investors with an attractive total return proposition in the range of 9% to 12%. Moving to an update on PPL's credit and our financing plan for 2024 on Slide 17. We continue to believe that having one of the sector's strongest balance sheets is a clear strategic advantage that provides the company with significant financial flexibility. Our updated business plan maintains strong credit metrics throughout. This includes maintaining a 16% to 18% FFO-to-debt ratio and a holding company to total debt ratio below 25%."", ""We have limited near-term refinancing risk with zero maturities in 2024 and only $550 million of total maturities in 2025. And we continue to maintain limited floating rate debt exposure, mitigating volatility in our plan. We also continue to be uniquely positioned to continue to fund our growth without the need for equity throughout our updated planning period, which is now extended through 2027. As investors think about our financing plan for 2024, they should expect our activity to be primarily focused on funding our utility capital plans with operating company debt. We've already executed a portion of this plan with our $650 million PPL Electric Utilities deal in January, which was executed at attractive pricing. We're also planning to be in the market for Rhode Island with our first debt offering since the acquisition."", ""We have no current plans for debt issuances in Kentucky or a PPO capital funding this year, but that is an area we'll continue to evaluate opportunistically in connection with market conditions and our strong financial position. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our financial position and outlook to execute our updated plan. This concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Vince."", ""Vince Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. As I mentioned earlier, this is a pivotal time for our industry, a time that requires us to lead with strength. There is no shortage of challenges facing our industry and being able to deliver the clean energy transition safely, reliably, and affordably for our customers. This is what gets me out of bed every morning and why I'm so excited to be a part of this industry at this moment in time. I'm convinced we have the right strategy for the right time, a strategy that prioritizes efficiency and affordability built on our core strength and will maximize long-term value for customers and shareowners alike. We are well-positioned to continue our competitive and predictable long-term earnings growth of 6% to 8% a year."", ""We've established a derisked and disciplined business plan that advances a safe, reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy future while providing investors with an attractive return proposition. And finally, we have an experienced leadership team that is 100% committed to delivering on these objectives and backed by a dedicated team of 6,500 strong across PPL. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."", 'See also 14 Best Medical Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds and 12 Best Breakout Stocks To Buy Right Now.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

You can skip our detailed analysis of income-generating stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Income Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\xa0', ""Dividends have played a significant role in the overall returns of the S&P 500 since 1930, contributing approximately 40% of the total return. However, during periods of high inflation, such as the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s, when inflation rates averaged 5% or more, dividends accounted for an even larger portion, around 54% of the total return. This insight came from Naveed Rahman, who serves as a co-manager of the Fidelity Equity-Income Strategy. The Fidelity report further elaborated on the performance of dividend stocks during inflationary periods, highlighting that during the 1930s and 2000s when the stock prices of the S&P 500 declined, dividends nearly offset those losses. Moreover, in the 1940s and 1970s, characterized by significant inflation spikes, dividends contributed substantially to the S&P 500's return, accounting for 65% and 71% respectively."", ""Dividend-paying stocks have become a cornerstone of many individual investor portfolios due to their ability to generate substantial income over time. This income component is essential as it can significantly contribute to the overall return on investment, helping investors achieve the necessary portfolio growth to meet their financial goals. A study conducted by Eagle Investment Management sheds light on the income potential of dividend-paying stocks. The study compared the income generated by a theoretical $1,000,000 investment made on December 31, 2012, in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, consisting of companies that have consistently increased their dividends for 25 years, with the broader S&P 500 Index, assuming reinvestment of dividends. According to the report, the initial investment of $1,000,000 in 2012 in the dividend aristocrats would have generated an income of $93,212 by 2022. In contrast, the income from the same investment in the S&P 500 during the same period would have been $55,726. This stark difference highlights the significant income potential offered by dividend aristocrats compared to the broader market index. Although historical, this example serves to demonstrate the importance of not just prioritizing dividends but also considering the growth of dividends. This dual focus is crucial for enhancing a portfolio's income stream gradually over time."", 'Throughout the years, stocks belonging to companies that begin and consistently increase their dividend payouts have shown superior performance compared to the overall market.

One of Berkshire's biggest investments has been in oil giant Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY)."", ""While Buffett doesn't want to pay dividends to his investors, they are becoming Occidental's top priority. It has grown its payout rapidly in recent years, which will likely continue."", ""Occidental Petroleum hasn't always prioritized paying dividends. The oil giant slashed its payout by 98.7% during the pandemic, cutting the quarterly payment down to a penny per share. It made the difficult decision to reduce its dividend so that it could retain additional cash for debt reduction. After making a debt-funded deal to buy fellow producer Anadarko Petroleum in 2019, it needed to shore up its balance sheet when prices crashed the following year. "", ""The company's strategy to rebuild its financial foundation has paid off.

While Berkshire's dividends from the preferred investment have fallen as Occidental started redeeming that investment, its common stock dividends are surging. "", 'At the new payout level, Berkshire will collect over $218 million in dividends from Occidental this year, up from about $178 million at the prior rate. That income will likely continue growing as Occidental increases its dividend and Berkshire buys more shares. That growing dividend will give Berkshire more cash to allocate to create value for its investors. It will also help offset the future decline of preferred dividends as Occidental redeems that investment. Those redemptions are likely going on pause through the end of next year as Occidental shifts its focus from repurchasing stock to quickly repaying the debt used to acquire CrownRock. However, once it hits its debt target, it can redirect its excess cash toward buying back stock and potentially accelerating the common dividend growth rate. ', ""Occidental Petroleum has been growing its dividend briskly since getting its balance sheet back on solid ground. That trend should continue even as the company works to reduce the debt it will incur to buy CrownRock. Meanwhile, it can potentially grow its payout even faster once it has redeemed Berkshire's preferred investment since that move will save it a lot of money.

The warehouse giant isn't very profitable, even for a retailer, due to its price-leadership selling approach. And shares are expensive, potentially limiting an investor's returns from here."", ""If you're shopping around in this niche but would like another option, you're in luck. There's a large, growing national retailer that's been posting double-digit profit margins, along with market-thumping customer traffic gains in recent quarters."", 'Read on for some reasons to consider Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA) shares right now.', 'The biggest knock against Ulta Beauty these days is that the business is going through a tough growth slowdown. Comparable-store sales were up 7% in the nine months that ran through late October, down from a 16% surge in the prior year period.', 'The makeup and beauty care niches are more price competitive lately due to this deceleration, giving Ulta and its peers less room to hike prices. That challenge combined with softer demand growth to make 2023 an unusually weak sales year.', 'Yet Ulta is faring well despite these issues. That 7% comps increase was powered by a robust 9% customer traffic spike that was offset by a nearly 2% drop in average spending per visit. Costco, in comparison, is boosting traffic by 4% in the core U.S. market, while average spending was down 1% last quarter.', 'Ulta is much more profitable than Costco. Sure, its operating profit margin has declined this year, slipping to 15% of sales from 17% of sales in 2022. This shift has contributed to roughly flat earnings, while most shareholders would prefer to see robust gains here.', ""But you'll still love the fact that Ulta's profit margin is far ahead of Costco's 3% rate. It's also well above the pre-pandemic profitability (of around 8% of sales) that investors were seeing as recently as 2019."", ""It's encouraging that this success arrived even as Ulta is facing more price-based competition and slower growth rates. Costco's management team makes it clear that the company intends to reinvest all excess cash into extending its price leadership, rather than allowing margins to rise."", 'Ulta, on the other hand, stands to see a rebound once the industry reaches a better balance between supply and demand. ""The outlook for the beauty category is bright, and I am confident Ulta Beauty has the right plans in place,"" CEO Dave Kimbell told investors in late November.', ""Costco stock is near an all-time high and is also trading at close to its highest premium to date. That's not the case with Ulta, though. You can buy this retailer for 2.4 times sales, down from recent highs of closer to 3 times sales. Ulta is cheaper than Costco on a price-to-earnings basis, with shares trading at 21 times profit compared to Costco's elevated premium of 49."", ""It's true that a Costco investment delivers much more stability due to the chain's massive global sales base and the steady income that's powered by subscription fees. Yet Ulta's bright long-term growth outlook, combined with its impressive earnings power, should have investors feeling just as good about its opportunities to generate excellent returns over the next several years."", ""If you've found yourself waiting in vain for Costco shares to get cheaper, then maybe it's time to consider owning Ulta Beauty instead."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Ulta Beauty right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Ulta Beauty, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ulta Beauty wasn’t one of them.

That describes CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP) pretty well. The company specializes in gene editing and has made significant progress in the field in recent years.', ""CRISPR's efforts have been rewarded. The biotech has generally delivered solid returns. Just how good has its stock-market performance been? Let's find out how much a $10,000 investment in the company would be worth today."", ""First, a little more background on CRISPR Therapeutics and its field of specialization. Gene editing is a group of technologies that allow scientists to modify an organism's DNA, thereby opening the door to treating diseases that have long eluded the medical research community. As its name suggests, CRISPR Therapeutics focuses on the CRISPR method of gene editing, a technique that earned its pioneers a Nobel Prize in chemistry."", ""The past five years have been somewhat volatile for the biotech. CRISPR Therapeutics' shares soared in the early days of the pandemic, partly thanks to progress in the clinic. However, once market conditions tightened and investors turned away from somewhat speculative and unprofitable stocks, the biotech's stock dropped."", 'Still, CRISPR Therapeutics closed 2023 with a significant accomplishment. It earned approval for its first product, a gene-editing therapy called Casgevy, which treats two rare blood disorders -- beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD). CRISPR Therapeutics created this medicine but developed it with the help of Vertex Pharmaceuticals. With this approval in its back pocket, CRISPR Therapeutics can now brag that its platform can lead to important breakthroughs.', ""So how much would a $10,000 investment in CRISPR Therapeutics in 2019 be worth today? The company has delivered a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.3% through this period, good enough to turn $10,000 into $24,146. The S&P 500's 14.8% CAGR over the same period would have grown the same investment to $19,896."", ""Can CRISPR Therapeutics deliver similar returns over the next five years? That will depend on at least two things. First is the company's ability to continue delivering meaningful clinical and regulatory progress. Second is Casgevy's potential success on the market. Let's start with Casgevy. It carries a price tag of $2.2 million in the U.S. That sounds like a lot, but it is pretty much average for a gene-editing therapy."", ""A competing SCD treatment called Lyfgenia, which also earned the green light late last year, will cost $3.1 million. The biotech behind it is Bluebird Bio, a much smaller company than even CRISPR Therapeutics, never mind Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Given Vertex's expertise in negotiating deals with third-party payers and its much bigger pockets and footprints in the industry, Casgevy should be much more successful than Lyfgenia. That's before we consider that Lyfgenia may come with the risk of blood cancer."", 'Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics plan to target 35,000 patients at first -- which means a potential market of more than $70 billion. Since gene-editing therapies are complex to administer, it will take some time for the revenue from Casgevy to ramp up, but it should happen well before 2029. CRISPR Therapeutics will keep 40% of the profits and incur 40% of the costs associated with the medicine, per its agreement with Vertex. However, that should be plenty for a company that currently generates little revenue and is consistently unprofitable.', ""What about the biotech's clinical progress? CRISPR Therapeutics has five other programs in clinical trials, with many more that should hit the clinic in the next couple of years. The company is working on a couple of cancer therapies and aiming to develop a functional cure for type 1 diabetes. While it's unlikely that all of CRISPR Therapeutics' programs will be successful, at least some of them should be, and it will be able to fund more thanks to the windfall from Casgevy."", ""In short, though CRISPR Therapeutics' performance over the last five years is tough to match, the biotech stock is well-positioned to deliver above-average future returns."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?', 'Before you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn’t one of them.

But the company has also spent the past few years developing candidates outside of this treatment area, in an effort to become a well-diversified biotech player.', ""In fact, Vertex's next product to market may be one that could treat one of the most common problems around -- pain -- and generate blockbuster revenue. The company aims to submit that candidate, VX-548, for regulatory approval by the middle of this year. Meanwhile, though, a young biotech has jumped out of stealth mode to land in the limelight -- and has announced its development of a very similar pain candidate."", ""Latigo Biotherapeutics recently scored $135 million in Series A financing to help it bring its candidate through phase 1 trials. Could this news hurt Vertex's prospects in the billion-dollar pain market? Let's find out."", ""First, let's talk about why commercializing a non-opioid pain treatment is such a big deal. Today, over-the-counter non-opioids often aren't strong enough to manage high pain levels, or they can cause serious side effects, such as the liver toxicity associated with acetaminophen. Even worse, prescription opioids, though effective, have been linked to addiction."", ""At the same time, the pain management market is huge and growing, expanding at a compound annual growth rate of 4.5% to potentially reach more than $108 billion by 2032, according to Global Market Insights. So, it's clear a new candidate that could beat today's drugs when it comes to safety, and at least equal today's drugs when it comes to efficacy, could win -- and even reach blockbuster status."", ""Now, let's consider the Vertex and Latigo pain candidates. They both address the problem in the same way, by targeting NaV1.8, a sodium channel that plays a key role in pain signaling."", 'Vertex recently reported positive pivotal trial data for VX-548, with the candidate meeting both of its primary endpoints. Patients taking VX-548 saw statistically significant improvement in pain versus those taking placebo, and the candidate also produced a clinically meaningful reduction in pain. Importantly, VX-548 showed that it could be effective in a wide range of pain conditions -- from surgical to those unrelated to surgery.', ""The only area where Vertex fell short is in proving that VX-548 is superior in efficacy to the combination of hydrocodone bitartrate (an opioid) with acetaminophen -- the most frequently prescribed opioid combination. I don't see this as a major problem, though. Considering the addiction risk associated with opioids, a non-opioid that works just as well shouldn't have difficulty gaining market share."", ""Latigo's candidate, LTG-001, is currently involved in a phase 1 trial, and the company's financing round should help support development. If all goes well, the biotech aims to seek approval in both chronic and acute pain, the same areas Vertex's candidate is addressing."", 'Vertex first is going for a broad moderate-to-severe acute pain approval this year, then later will aim for approval in peripheral neuropathic pain, or chronic nerve pain. The company recently reported positive phase 2 data in a trial for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, so the next step should be a pivotal trial.', ""Now, let's get back to our question: Could Latigo's entrance represent a threat to Vertex? The answer is no -- for several reasons."", 'First, Vertex is much closer to commercialization. If all goes well, the company could gain the first-to-market advantage.', 'Second, Vertex is a well-established, profitable company, and has the manufacturing, logistics, and sales infrastructure to hit the ground running if VX-548 wins approval. The company has experience launching new products, and this should serve it well as it expands from CF into other areas.', 'Finally, the market is big enough for more than one player to succeed. So, if a new entrant like Latigo crosses the commercialization finish line a few years from now, it could carve out some market share -- without necessarily disrupting Vertex.', ""All of this means Vertex investors shouldn't worry about the big biotech's prospects in the billion-dollar pain market. As it's done in the world of CF treatment, it could score a lasting win."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Coca-Cola name has incredible brand power, and it generates tons of cash to run the company and return some to shareholders. But there's something else that's driving higher growth now at the beverage giant -- and that's in the form of some of its other brands you might not know."", ""Coca-Cola owns 200 brands in several ready-to-drink categories. That's actually trimmed down from about 400 before the pandemic. Management let go of about half its brands, mostly small, locally based brands that accounted for 2% of volume and only 1% of revenue. That was to free up resources to devote to its larger, core brands."", ""And it's still developing and acquiring new brands. That's important because it's the newer brands that are contributing to higher growth overall. Coca-Cola has five categories: sparkling soft drinks; juice, value-added dairy, and plant-based; water, sports, coffee, and tea; energy; and hot beverages. It also has an emerging category."", ""The company doesn't break out figures for how much each brand or category accounts for out of total sales, but it does provide growth rates. Although trademark Coca-Cola likely accounts for the bulk of total sales, it's not the fastest-growing. In the 2023 fourth quarter, trademark Coca-Cola sales increased 2% over last year, but juice, value-added dairy, and plant-based beverages increased 6%. That performance was driven by Minute Maid brand Pulpy in China, Mazoe brand in Africa, and Fairlife dairy brand in the U.S."", 'This illustrates broader trends that management has identified.', ""Sparkling drinks, with Coca-Cola as the dominant brand, are shrinking as a portion of the overall non-alcoholic, ready-to-drink market. Even though the company got rid of underperforming brands, it's crucial for it to invest in higher-growth brands that can generate higher sales, because these other categories present the most compelling growth opportunities. If this was the change from five years ago, it's likely to keep moving in that direction."", ""Management puts a tremendous amount of investment into its trademark Coca-Cola drinks because they're popular and people are willing to spend on them. Total revenue increased 6% in 2023, with a 2% increase in concentrate sales but a 10% increase in price/mix. Most likely, the price increase came predominantly from Coke's core brands that have strong pricing power."", 'Management said that Coca-Cola became the 10th-most-valuable brand in the world in 2023, moving up seven spots from the year before, and Sprite was the top beverage brand for Gen Z drinkers. Building these brands with its customers boosts its pricing power for these drinks.', ""Coca-Cola performed well in 2023 despite inflationary pressures. It has an incredible global distribution network, a strong marketing program that keeps its brands in customers' minds, and pricing power that led to increased earnings per share. As it keeps up sales for its core brands, it generates large amounts of cash, with nearly $10 billion in free cash flow in 2023. That's used to develop the new brands that will be the high-growth brands of the future."", ""That cash is also used to fund its storied dividend. Many investors find value in Coca-Cola stock because it's a Dividend King, and its dividend yield is 3.1% at the current price.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 3.1%, which is fairly typical for the industry."", ' See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ', ""We aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Prior to this announcement, Coca-Cola was paying out 74% of earnings and more than 75% of free cash flows. This indicates that the company is more focused on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business, but we don't think that there are necessarily signs that the dividend might be unsustainable."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 27.6% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 62%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', 'The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $1.12, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.84. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 5.1% per annum over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.', 'Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Coca-Cola has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 10% per annum. The payout ratio is very much on the higher end, which could mean that the growth rate will slow down in the future, and that could flow through to the dividend as well.', ""In summary, it's great to see that the company can raise the dividend and keep it in a sustainable range. However, lack of cash flows makes us wary of the potential for cuts in the dividend's future, even though the dividend is generally looking okay. This looks like it could be a good dividend stock going forward, but we would note that the payout ratio has been at higher levels in the past so it could happen again."", ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for Coca-Cola that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

The beverage behemoth topped its fourth-quarter revenue estimates and matched its earnings expectations. Shares slumped a little following the news, but that stumble had more to do with marketwide weakness than the company's fourth-quarter results."", ""Perhaps more important than Coca-Cola's quarterly numbers, however, is what a couple of details buried within those numbers mean. The already bullish case for owning a stake in this company just got even better."", 'For the three-month stretch ended in December, Coca-Cola turned sales of $10.8 billion into non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings of $0.49 per share. The top line improved 7% on a year-over-year basis (although organic non-GAAP sales were up 12%), while operating per-share profits grew 10%.', ""Earnings were in line with estimates, but the top line topped analysts' expectations of only $10.7 billion. Those numbers cap off a similarly solid full fiscal year. The exciting part of the fourth-quarter figures, though, is buried deeper in the report -- in two places."", '1. Coca-Cola still enjoys plenty of pricing power', 'The first of these places is in the company\'s explanation of how it managed to grow its sales so well in an economic environment that\'s proving challenging for consumers. Coca-Cola\'s Q4 press release notes that ""organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 12%, driven by 9% growth in price/mix and 3% growth in concentrate sales.""', ""Translation: Most of last quarter's top-line improvement is the result of price increases passed along to its bottling partners and, ultimately, to consumers. The total volume of beverages sold in Q4 was only up 2% year over year."", 'This is not insignificant. Plenty of households in the U.S. and abroad are more cost-conscious than usual right now. Domestic credit card debt is at record levels, and delinquencies are (finally) starting to surge. More people are also borrowing from their 401(k) accounts now, underscoring just how tough things are at this time. These strained consumers still found a way to pay a slightly higher price for their favorite Coca-Cola-made drink.', 'That\'s not a mere stroke of luck, by the way. That\'s the outcome of years\' worth of brilliant advertising, with lots of lifestyle marketing to back it up. More to the point, it\'s the result of the incredible brand loyalty the beverage company has fostered over the years -- a tailwind that doesn\'t die easily. In fact, although it didn\'t offer any specifics, Coca-Cola\'s Q4 press release adds, ""For both the quarter and the full year, the company gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages.""', '2. Costs remain in check', ""And the other hidden victory in last quarter's numbers? Although Coca-Cola may be charging higher prices to its customers, it's not experiencing as much cost pain itself."", ""There are a couple of metrics pointing to this conclusion. One of them is the company's operating margin rates. Coca-Cola's operating profit margin of 21% for the three months ended in December was up slightly from the year-ago comparison of 20.5%. For the entirety of 2023, operational margins improved from 22.7% to 23.1%. In this vein, the company's cost of goods sold (production, logistics, inputs, etc.) was only up 3% year over year during Q4, as it was for all of 2023."", ""Another way of measuring the success of Coca-Cola's cost-curbing efforts is the company's cash flow. It grew, too. All told, last year's operating cash flow of $11.6 billion was up 5% year over year. Per-share operating earnings of $2.69 improved 2022's tally by 8%, boosted slightly by stock buybacks."", ""More of the same is in the cards too, at least according to CFO John Murphy. He believes growth of the company's operating costs will continue cooling off this year, and at the same time expects Coca-Cola's organic revenue to improve between 6% and 7%. The end result, he said during the company's latest earnings call, will be wider profit margins."", ""Obviously, there's more information in Coca-Cola's Q4 report to consider than just these two points of data. Besides, companies are more than their numbers. Product quality, marketing ideas, intellectual property, name recognition, and even corporate leaders are also factors that matter, as the right combination of these things can change a company's results for the better. That's why you should always consider the bigger picture before stepping into any stock."", ""On the flip side, strong numbers are often evidence that an organization has mastered the business it's in. That's particularly true when the organization in question is a company like Coca-Cola, which has been producing these kinds of results and this kind of growth for a long, long time."", ""It's getting very difficult to find any reasons not to own a piece of this beverage giant."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of income-generating stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Income Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\xa0', ""Dividends have played a significant role in the overall returns of the S&P 500 since 1930, contributing approximately 40% of the total return. However, during periods of high inflation, such as the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s, when inflation rates averaged 5% or more, dividends accounted for an even larger portion, around 54% of the total return. This insight came from Naveed Rahman, who serves as a co-manager of the Fidelity Equity-Income Strategy. The Fidelity report further elaborated on the performance of dividend stocks during inflationary periods, highlighting that during the 1930s and 2000s when the stock prices of the S&P 500 declined, dividends nearly offset those losses. Moreover, in the 1940s and 1970s, characterized by significant inflation spikes, dividends contributed substantially to the S&P 500's return, accounting for 65% and 71% respectively."", ""Dividend-paying stocks have become a cornerstone of many individual investor portfolios due to their ability to generate substantial income over time. This income component is essential as it can significantly contribute to the overall return on investment, helping investors achieve the necessary portfolio growth to meet their financial goals. A study conducted by Eagle Investment Management sheds light on the income potential of dividend-paying stocks. The study compared the income generated by a theoretical $1,000,000 investment made on December 31, 2012, in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, consisting of companies that have consistently increased their dividends for 25 years, with the broader S&P 500 Index, assuming reinvestment of dividends. According to the report, the initial investment of $1,000,000 in 2012 in the dividend aristocrats would have generated an income of $93,212 by 2022. In contrast, the income from the same investment in the S&P 500 during the same period would have been $55,726. This stark difference highlights the significant income potential offered by dividend aristocrats compared to the broader market index. Although historical, this example serves to demonstrate the importance of not just prioritizing dividends but also considering the growth of dividends. This dual focus is crucial for enhancing a portfolio's income stream gradually over time."", 'Throughout the years, stocks belonging to companies that begin and consistently increase their dividend payouts have shown superior performance compared to the overall market. Conversely, stocks of companies that reduce or fail to pay dividends have notably underperformed. According to findings from a report by RMB Capital, from 1972 to 2018, dividend-growing companies and those initiating dividends delivered an average annual return of 9.62%, while stocks of companies cutting dividends experienced a negative return of 0.79%.

Let's look at why you might want to buy Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) stock like there's no tomorrow."", 'P&G has had no problem growing through the difficult selling conditions that characterized the past several quarters.

""We delivered strong results...enabling us to raise our core EPS growth guidance and maintain our top-line outlook,"" CEO Jon Moeller said in a press release.', ""It's worth watching sales volumes in the next few quarterly reports since growth has been weak here.

Net profit was up a healthy 16% last quarter, helping profit margins expand even as sales growth slowed. These wins are allowing the company to easily send nearly $15 billion back to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases each year.', 'P&G underperformed the market in 2023, which has made it a relatively cheap choice for income investors.

As of the end of 2023, Berkshire's stake in the homebuilder totaled around $21.7 million. That amounts to pocket change for the huge conglomerate. Since Berkshire exited its position in D.R.

If you would like to skip our analysis of the factors impacting the aviation industry, you can go to the 5 Most Expensive Countries to Fly to.', 'After a brief dip during the pandemic, flight prices have soared globally, with a recent report showing an increase of 31% in average flight prices over the last two years. However, the cost of flying to different regions has not increased in a uniform manner. Figures from the report reveal that flight prices have risen the most in Northern Europe as well as the Mediterranean and Asian regions. Each region has expensive and inexpensive countries to visit. For example, the Netherlands is amongst the most expensive countries to visit in Europe, while South Korea is one of the most expensive countries to visit in Asia. \xa0Airline ticket prices are rising in the USA also. The consumer price index for airline tickets rose by 25% during 2022, which was the highest increase to date, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.', 'One of the most significant factors influencing airfares is the cost of jet fuel, which currently accounts for roughly 31% of airline operating expenses. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), jet fuel prices rose by 92% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and global supply chain disruptions. IATA has also forecasted the average fuel price to be $113.8 per barrel in 2024. This will lead to a total cost of $281 billion for airlines, which can translate to higher ticket prices for passengers.', 'Labor shortages within airlines and airports are also driving up operating costs. According to projections from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the aviation sector is expected to require 480,000 new technicians for aircraft maintenance and around 350,000 pilots by the year 2026. The scarcity of skilled labor is resulting in issues such as flight delays, cancellations, and low passenger satisfaction. Moreover, this issue is likely to be further aggravated since 50% of pilots, particularly captains, are expected to retire within the next 15 years. To respond to the shortage, airlines are significantly increasing the salaries of pilots. Beyond the cost side, the demand equation is also fueling higher airfares. According to IATA, 4.7 billion people will travel in 2024, which is higher than the pre-pandemic level of 4.5 billion in 2019. This imbalance between booming demand and a limited supply of resources is pushing prices upwards.', 'Furthermore, the aviation industry is beginning to take initiatives for a greener future by utilizing sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). However, SAFs are currently 3 times more expensive than traditional jet fuel. Moreover, $5.1 trillion dollars will be required to achieve the goal of zero emissions by 2050. The higher price of SAFs is translating into increased ticket prices for passengers who prioritize airlines focusing on sustainability. As SAF production scales up and costs decrease, this impact on ticket prices is expected to lessen, but currently, it contributes to pricing pressures.', 'The trend of rising airfares is expected to continue in 2024. Global airfares are predicted to increase by 3% - 5% in 2024 as airlines such as United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) struggle with high fuel costs, incorporation of sustainable aviation fuels and an aging fleet. Despite the predictions, there are ways to always plan affordable trips, even to the 20 most expensive countries to fly to from the USA and other countries. Booking flights in advance, opting for flexible travel dates, and considering budget airlines are all effective approaches to lower costs. You can also check out the 20 Safest Airlines in the World for 2024 here.', 'A modern commercial jet airliner decorated with the company logo in flight against a clear blue sky.', 'To shortlist the 20 most expensive countries to fly to, we referred to the latest Travel and Tourism Development Index by the World Economic Forum. This Index, which comprises more than 110 countries, has been published on a bi-annual basis for more than a decade by the World Economic Forum. The ‘Price Competitiveness Sub Index’ takes into account various factors such as airfare ticket taxes, airport charges, and the impact of fuel prices on travel expenses.

This makes the dividend yield 3.4%, which is above the industry average."", ' See our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group ', 'While it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 101% of what it was earning, however the dividend was quite comfortably covered by free cash flows at a cash payout ratio of only 17%. Given that the dividend is a cash outflow, we think that cash is more important than accounting measures of profit when assessing the dividend, so this is a mitigating factor.', 'Analysts expect a massive rise in earnings per share in the next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 31% which is fairly sustainable.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.92 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.76. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 12% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period."", ""Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Principal Financial Group's EPS has fallen by approximately 13% per year during the past five years.

We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited."", ""In summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Principal Financial Group's payments are rock solid.

We don't think Principal Financial Group is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus."", ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.
