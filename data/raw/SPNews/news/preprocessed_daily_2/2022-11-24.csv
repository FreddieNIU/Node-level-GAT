You should consider the Schwab U.S. LargeCap Value ETF (SCHV), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/11/2009.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $10.23 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.While value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, they also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.22%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 15.90% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Industrials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (BRKB) accounts for about 2.55% of total assets, followed by Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM).The top 10 holdings account for about 16.55% of total assets under management.Story continuesPerformance and RiskSCHV seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Value Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Value Total Stock Market Index is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index containing the large-cap value portion of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index.The ETF has lost about -5.21% so far this year and is down about -3.13% in the last one year (as of 11/24/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $58.51 and $74.19.The ETF has a beta of 0.95 and standard deviation of 24.52% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 533 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. LargeCap Value ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, SCHV is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $55.23 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $107.01 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LinePassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp U.S. Bancorp Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Timothy Welsh, sold US$834k worth of shares at a price of US$43.92 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$44.11. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 26% of Timothy Welsh's stake.U.S. Bancorp insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.U.S. Bancorp Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at U.S. Bancorp. Specifically, insiders ditched US$2.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes U.S. Bancorp Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that U.S. Bancorp insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$111m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At U.S. Bancorp Tell Us?Insiders sold U.S. Bancorp shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

(NYSE:CF) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.26bUS$1.88bUS$1.56bUS$1.52bUS$1.51bUS$1.51bUS$1.51bUS$1.53bUS$1.55bUS$1.57bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ -0.97%Est @ -0.09%Est @ 0.53%Est @ 0.97%Est @ 1.27%Est @ 1.48% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$3.0kUS$1.6kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$940US$887US$839US$795(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$13bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.6b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.0%) = US$32bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$32b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$16bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$29b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$110, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 25% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at CF Industries Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.989. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

7,0d739f82-25d6-3eac-baa4-42522c751167,WMT,2022-11-24,"While institutions own 32% of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), private companies are its largest shareholders with 47% ownership",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/while-institutions-own-32-walmart-130041047.html,1669294841,STORY,['WMT'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that private companies own the lion's share in the company with 47% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And institutions on the other hand have a 32% ownership in the company. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Walmart. View our latest analysis for Walmart ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walmart?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Walmart already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Walmart's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthWalmart is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Walton Enterprises, LLC is the largest shareholder with 37% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 10% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.8% by the third-largest shareholder.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 3 shareholders collectively control more than half of the company's shares, implying that they have considerable power to influence the company's decisions.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of WalmartThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Walmart Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$3.7b worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 20% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Walmart. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Private Company OwnershipOur data indicates that Private Companies hold 47%, of the company's shares. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Walmart better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Walmart that you should be aware of before investing here.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Penney, Apple Inc. and Walgreens, put in place new surveillance systems or more security guards.

One survey by the National Retail Federation (NRF) cited a 26.5% jump last year in ""organized retail crime"" carried out by groups of people.But it is unclear whether overall U.S. retail crime is on the rise, with little data available on the problem. Total losses from shoplifting, theft, fraud and errors for U.S. retailers in 2021 remained steady at an average rate of 1.4% of total sales, as it had been over the previous five years.Story continuesStill, retailers are diverting more resources towards security this quarter, which could add pressure on margins already squeezed by higher gas, transportation, labor and raw material costs.Part of the problem is that prosecuting petty crime is a hassle, and some states raised their thresholds for the value of merchandise stolen to around $1,000 to trigger a felony charge.That puts the onus on preventing crime in the first place, especially during the Thanksgiving weekend that is expected to see a record shopper turnout. The busy holiday season represents nearly 20% of total U.S. retail sales for the year.SURVEILLANCE AND STROBE LIGHTSA sign of the times can be seen in the small communities of Paducah, Kentucky, and Opelika, Alabama, where Walmart, J.C. Penney, Walgreens and other major retailers have brought in large, mobile surveillance units that record all activity in their parking lots.Walmart, for example, said it has nine surveillance units outside three massive Supercenter stores in both cities. One of the retailer's stores in Virginia on Tuesday was the scene of the latest mass shooting in the United States, when a manager opened fire and killed six people before turning the gun on himself.In Paducah and Opelika, the units provided by LiveView Technologies as part of a pilot offer 24-hour video footage to retailers so they can alert authorities of any suspicious activity, said Brian Laird, Paducah's chief of police. They also have flashing strobe lights and loud speakers to warn potential thieves that their actions are being observed.Others retailers have focused their anti-theft efforts inside their stores.

A Walmart employee killed six people and wounded several others before fatally shooting himself at a store in Chesapeake, Virginia on Tuesday night, just days after a gunman killed 5 and injured 17 at a Colorado LGBTQ nightclub. In a statement early Wednesday, Walmart said it was shocked at the violence and is working closely with law enforcement. The store was crowded ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.Credit Suisse expects to post a pre-tax loss of up to 1 and 1/2 billion Swiss francs in its fourth quarter. That's about $1.6 billion in US dollars. The bank notes the challenging economic and market environment hurt client activity, while cash outflows across the business had increased at the start of the fourth quarter. In response, shareholders approved a roughly $4.2 billion capital raise to fund the bank's turnaround. That's a sign of confidence perhaps in the firm's strategy.A district judge recommended Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes be designated to the federal prison camp at Bryan, Texas to serve her 11-year and three-month prison sentence. That's according to a November 21 filing. The camp is a minimum security prison, housing female inmates described by the Federal Bureau of Prisons as, quote, ""work and program oriented."" While that was the judge's recommendation, the final decision will be made by the US Bureau of Prisons. Holmes has been ordered to surrender herself into custody by April 27 of next year. Sozz.]"

JWN posted impressive third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein both the top and the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, both metrics fell from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s readings. Results gained from strength in core categories in men's and women's apparel and shoes as customers returned to occasions, travel, work and holidays. Also, it remains on track with the Closer to You strategy as well as supply-chain optimization efforts.Shares of JWN have gained 23.2% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 0.8%.However, demand decelerated in late June, inducing Nordstrom to right-size its inventory and expenses in response to the current macroeconomic environment. Shares of this presently Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) declined more than 9% in after-hours trading on Nov 22.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarterly HighlightsNordstrom posted adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share, down from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s 39 cents. However, the metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 14 cents per share.Total revenues of $3,546 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,521 million for the ninth straight quarter. However, the metric declined 2.5% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s figure due to the shift in the timing of the Anniversary sale, wherein a day of the sale was part of the third quarter of 2022. This had a 200-bps negative impact on sales.Net sales fell 2.9% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally to $3,433 million and lagged our estimate of $4,373.1 million. Credit Card net revenues grew 9.7% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level to $113 million and came ahead of our estimate of $104.7 million.For third-quarter fiscal 2022, net sales for the Nordstrom brand decreased 3.4% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s number to $2,264 million and fell below our estimate of $3,106.7 million.Sales for the Nordstrom Rack brand dipped 1.9% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to $1,169 million and lagged our estimate of $1,307.9 million. This was mainly due to muted demand, particularly from lower-income customers. As a result, Nordstrom Rack reduced store-based order fulfillment and raised the minimum order amount for free ship-to-store delivery on rack.com. These actions led to lesser order cancellations, simplified rack operations and improved profitability. Going ahead, it continues focusing on introducing more premium brands at Rack, better assortment and increased brand awareness.Digital sales plunged 16.4% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading due to the shift in the timing of the Anniversary Sale, which had a 300-bps headwind on digital sales. For the fiscal third quarter, digital sales represented 34% of net sales. Also, the metric was hurt by a channel shift as customers return to store shopping.Nordstrom's gross profit margin contracted 190 basis points (bps) from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals to 33.2% for the reported quarter due to higher markdowns.SG&amp;A expense, as a percentage of sales, expanded 200 bps to 36.4% due to supply-chain technology and a related asset impairment charge, partly offset by reduced fulfillment expense. Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, were flat with the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level at 34.3% for the fiscal third quarter.Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $3 million reflected growth from $127 million in the year-ago fiscal quarter. The increase mainly resulted from higher markdowns, supply-chain technology and a related asset impairment charge, offset by fulfillment expense efficiencies. Adjusted EBIT was $73 million, down 42.5% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading in the reported quarter.Story continuesOther FinancialsNordstrom ended third-quarter fiscal 2022 with available liquidity worth $993 million as of Jul 30, 2022, including $293 million of cash and cash equivalents.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose less than 1% even as iPhone supply worries continued to linger amid Covid-19 lockdowns at China-based supplier Foxconn.Despite the supply worries, Apple is seeing ""strong"" iPhone upgrade activity from AT&amp;T and Verizon and in-store activity has been ""solid,” Wedbush said in a note.Consumer stocks, meanwhile, were led higher by a more than 7% rise in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) after Citigroup upgraded the stock to neutral from sell, citing a more balanced valuation following the recent pullback.The earnings front, meanwhile, delivered mixed quarterly results.Deere&amp;Company (NYSE:DE) delivered a full-year outlook pointing to ongoing demand after reporting quarterly results that topped Wall Street estimates, sending its shares more than 6% higher.Story continuesNordstrom (NYSE:JWN) fell 5% as better-than-expected quarterly results were offset by slowing sales that raised concerns that the department store may have to increase promotional activity, hurting margins.“[W]e struggle to see how JWN will achieve its implied 7.9% to 9.1% EBIT margin in 4Q,” Credit Suisse said in a note.Energy stocks struggled to join in on the rally as falling oil prices weighed on investor sentiment amid data showing a larger-than-expected drop in weekly U.S. crude stockpiles and reports that G7 nations are weighing up a price cap on Russian oil in a range of $65 to $70 per barrel.Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) were the biggest drags in the sector.Related ArticlesStock market today: Dow ends higher as Fed minutes show end of jumbo hikes 'soon'Berkshire Hathaway says Warren Buffett donates shares to family charitiesMexico's Inbursa drops bid for Citigroup's Mexican retail arm Citibanamex]"

(NYSE:UAA) has been much stronger than before, rebounding by 35%. But that isn't much consolation to those who have suffered through the declines of the last year. Specifically, the stock price slipped by 61% in that time. So the bounce should be viewed in that context. You could argue that the sell-off was too severe.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Under Armour To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the last year Under Armour saw its earnings per share drop below zero. Buyers no doubt think it's a temporary situation, but those with a nose for quality have low tolerance for losses. We hope for shareholders' sake that the company becomes profitable again soon.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Under Armour's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 19% in the twelve months, Under Armour shareholders did even worse, losing 61%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 5% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance.

In the US Total Cap space, these securities outperformed non-dividend payers by 39.6% in 2021, as reported by IHS Markit.

The company received an all-cash takeover offer from rival Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), which we also held in the portfolio, for SEK 106 per share—a 35% premium to Swedish Match’s prior closing share price.

PM can also leverage its global scale to generate significant revenue synergies from these complementary product sets, as well as quickly gain access to the US market—the world’s largest market for RRPs and one where regulators have embraced RRPs and other less harmful nicotine products.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for MGM Resorts International MGM Resorts International's Improving ProfitsIn the last three years MGM Resorts International's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Impressively, MGM Resorts International's EPS catapulted from US$1.26 to US$3.34, over the last year. It's not often a company can achieve year-on-year growth of 166%. The best case scenario? That the business has hit a true inflection point.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. EBIT margins for MGM Resorts International remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 61% to US$13b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

It is also worth noting that it was Independent Chairman Paul Salem who made the biggest single purchase, worth US$998k, paying US$28.92 per share.The good news, alongside the insider buying, for MGM Resorts International bulls is that insiders (collectively) have a meaningful investment in the stock. With a whopping US$97m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success.

Both contracts fell over 3% on Wednesday, and settled at their weakest level since late September.Weighing heavily on the crude market was the news that the Group of Seven major industrialized nations were looking at a cap on Russian seaborne oil at $65-$70 a barrel, above the level that had been expected when the group first proposed the idea as a way of punishing Moscow for the war in Ukraine.European Union governments have not yet agreed and are currently discussing the proposal, but a price cap at this level would likely mean that Russia will continue to sell its oil, reducing the risk of a supply shortage in global oil markets.“At this level, the cap would achieve one of the two objectives - it would likely keep Russian oil flowing,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “As for the other objective of trying to cap Russian oil revenues, some may question how aggressive this level actually is.”Elsewhere, the Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories fell by 3.7 million barrels last week, but gasoline and distillate inventories both rose substantially.“When taking into account SPR releases of around 1.6MMbbls, total US crude oil inventories fell by 5.29MMbbls over the week,” ING said. “This crude draw occurred despite crude oil imports increasing by around 1.5MMbbls/d over the week, hitting their highest levels since the end of July.”Crude markets have fallen sharply this month, pressured by a rise in daily COVID cases in China to near 30,000, similar to levels seen in April.Chinese officials have responded by ordering more aggressive efforts to check the spread of the virus, ordering lockdowns and movement curbs which are likely to limit economic activity in the world’s largest crude importer.Story continuesNomura cut its forecasts for China’s economic growth for this year to 2.8% from 2.9%, and next to 4% from 4.3%, citing a “slow, costly and bumpy” reopening of the country as Covid cases surge.Attention is also turning to the next meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, to decide production levels moving into the new year.OPEC+ meets on Dec. 4, a day before a European Union ban on Russian crude imports along with a G-7 price-cap plan are scheduled to start.Related ArticlesCrude oil lower; Russian price cap in spotlightKingfisher shares drop after DIY retailer trims annual income outlookFord recalls nearly 519,000 U.S. vehicles over fire risks]"

We have seen a bit of a rebound coming off of the significant selloff that we saw on the back of the FTX collapse. And we see Bitcoin now right now at 16,400, just above that level, up about 1 and 1/2%. Ethereum at 1,161.The disgraced founder of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, apologized to his former employees in a two-page letter obtained by CoinDesk. The memo sent to company staff detailed the $60 billion in collateral and $2 billion in liabilities that FTX had this spring.Now SBF says he felt deeply sorry and froze up in the face of pressure when the fallout began. He did not address allegations that FTX diverted customer and corporate funds to prop up Alameda Research, which is, of course, also owned by SBF. He also didn't address any other recent revelations around Alameda.Well, the FTX fallout continues with analysts picking through the rubble to figure out who's been hit the hardest. Morgan Stanley out with a new report. We've got Yahoo Finance's Jen Schonberger to break that report down for us. Jen, what are the other dominoes to fall?JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: Good morning, Akiko. We're starting to get a better picture of the contagion and individual exposure that companies have had to FTX's bankruptcy. Morgan Stanley has compiled a list of 63 companies based on media disclosures, public disclosures, as well as their own research on firms that may have suffered losses from FTX's failure.Among those firms, venture capital firm Sequoia Capital appears to have the largest exposure with $213.5 million. Sequoia has reportedly said that it will mark down its investment in FTX to zero.Also topping that list, Singapore's state-owned holding company, Temasek, with $205 million. Other high profile crypto companies with exposure, according to Morgan Stanley, Galaxy Digital with over 76 million, US crypto exchange Coinbase with 15 million, stablecoin issuer Circle with over 10 million, and crypto exchange Crypto.com with 10 million in exposure.Story continuesNow this research comes as court papers show FTX is on the hook for more than $3 billion to top creditors, though specific names were redacted from those court filings. So this research giving us perhaps a clue into those players.Meanwhile, shares of Coinbase, which, again, had a $15 million exposure to FTX, according to Morgan Stanley, are up this morning after the crypto exchange's shares plunged earlier this week to its lowest level since going public last April.Coinbase's shares saw its market cap plummet from $85 billion to below $10 billion before popping up over $11 billion in the last couple of trading days, as worries have swirled over its exposure to FTX, as well as in the wake of Bitcoin's continued descent. Full disclosure, I do own shares of Coinbase. Back to you.AKIKO FUJITA: OK, Jen Schonberger with the very latest on that front. Thanks so much for that.]"

While we've seen tens of thousands of employee departures from tech companies like Meta, Snap, and Twitter in recent weeks, the back-to-back announcements by Amazon and FedEx are especially worrisome because they're happening just before Christmas.Continue reading]"

He expects this number to grow as the company continues to push its multi-cloud offering.With 12 industry clouds and 30% higher ASPs, Salesforce is tailoring its expansion to nearly every industry on the corporate level.Currently, 64% of ARR is based in the Americas, with roughly 36% coming from its international base. He expects this mix to become more diversified over the next few years as the company continues to expand globally in 2023 and beyond.In this period of softer growth ahead during this dark economic storm, he believes that software stalwarts will likely become much more aggressive on the M&amp;A front.He also notes that the Slack deal is gaining traction within the CRM ecosystem, resulting in cross-selling opportunities.Price Action: CRM shares traded higher by 0.64% at $150.21 on the last check Wednesday.Photo Via Wikimedia CommonsLatest Ratings for CRMDateFirmActionFromToMar 2022WedbushMaintainsOutperformMar 2022Canaccord GenuityMaintainsBuyMar 2022Raymond JamesMaintainsStrong BuyView More Analyst Ratings for CRMStory continuesView the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaSalesforce Analyst Slashes Price Target By 14% To Reflect Broad-Based Macro Concerns In Front-Office SoftwareTrump Declared Losses On Tax Returns For A Decade, Testifies Former AccountantDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Worries about a likely 2023 recession, and its impact on enterprise IT spending, have come off the back burner.With rising interest rates showing little sign of reversing course anytime soon, uncertainty about results in the coming quarters is again on the rise. That’s bad news, for anyone buying the CRM stock today in the hope of a fast recovery.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInstead, a further pullback (albeit a moderate one) appears more likely. With this, it’s still not an opportune time to add this beaten-down tech name to your portfolio.CRMSalesforce$148.04CRM Stock Is Sinking AgainIt’s safe to say the boom times for tech are over, at least for now. With the economic slowdown having a dramatic impact on companies across the tech sector, leading names in the industry, Salesforce included, have announced layoffs.However, while this downsizing will enable CRM to ride out the in-progress downturn, the positives are likely to be far outweighed by reduced IT spending by its clients.As a result, there’s renewed bearishness for CRM stock. Sell-side analysts like Monness Crespi Hardt’s Brian White, have downgraded the stock, citing the prospect of the enterprise IT sales slump continuing to get worse.Investors seem to agree, given the stock’s noticeable drop on the heels of the downgrade.Salesforce walked back guidance when it last reported results back in August.The Sell-Off Could ContinueIf Salesforce continues to walk back guidance, another moderate drop in price may lie ahead. CRM could easily re-hit its 52-week low ($136.04 per share), or even hit a new multi-year low, during this timeframe.Story continuesSalesforce shares could languish after finally hitting a bottom. If the downturn in enterprise IT carries on into 2024, the stock could deliver middling returns for over a year.It wouldn’t be the first time. It’s worth mentioning that CRM traded sideways from late 2018, until early 2020 when the pandemic tailwinds sent it back into hyperdrive.Sure, one can argue that the efforts from the above-mentioned activist (Starboard Value), could push for changes that help move the needle for CRM, independent of a software sector recovery. Then again, only time will tell whether Starboard makes headway.The VerdictI wouldn’t completely dismiss Starboard’s potential to be a long-term catalyst for the stock.At the same time, though considering this activist’s position isn’t even large enough to warrant a 13-D filing (i.e. 5% or more of the company), Salesforce may feel little pressure to implement Starboard’s game plan.For now, it’s best to assume a recovery will only happen when the downturn in enterprise IT spending fully plays out. With plenty of time until that happens, there’s no reason to rush into CRM stock today.CRM stock earns a D rating in Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Louis Navellier, who has been called “one of the most important money managers of our time,” has broken the silence in this shocking “tell all” video… exposing one of the most shocking events in our country’s history… and the one move every American needs to make today.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayEarly Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air”It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

To skip the industry analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Electrical Companies in the USA.Utility stocks such as electric utilities are among the favorites of conservative investors, especially during a recession. These stocks have a low beta, which means market volatility doesn’t affect them much.Utility companies are heavily regulated, due to which the number of competitors of these companies is fewer compared to other sectors of the market. This allows investors to easily predict the revenues and profits of these companies.Up until mid-September, utility companies, including electrical companies, were among the best-performing stocks of 2022. Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU) had a 5% return while S&amp;P 500 had declined by 18% YTD. However, in October, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes showed their effects on the sector and the fund kept falling for several sessions and was the worst-performing sector among 11 S&amp;P industry groups. Janney analyst Michael Gaugler believes the current year could be disappointing for the utility sector and industry ""is likely to rally once the U.S. Federal Reserve signals its rate hike policy is coming to a close.""In the future, the utility sector should rally due to the aggressive adoption of electric vehicles and the Biden administration’s clean energy and infrastructure legislation.Future OutlookThe power generation market size was around $1.39 trillion in 2020 and is expected to reach $1.83 trillion by 2028 at a CAGR of 3.53%. According to the World Energy Outlook 2019, the global electric utility demand is expected to increase at the rate of 2.1% per annum till 2040, and the electricity demand is set to double by 2050.The utility market has always benefited during recessionary times as seen in the 2001 and 2007-09 recessions. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the utility sector is outperforming the market by 30%.Story continuesThis article is about the biggest electrical utility companies in the United States. Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC), PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) are some of the biggest electrical and electric utility companies that investors should keep an eye on.10 Biggest Electrical Companies in the USAPhoto by Matthew Henry on UnsplashOur MethodologyAfter a careful assessment of the electrical industry in the United States, we selected these 10 companies based on the number of customers, size of their operations, financial performance, analyst ratings, and growth catalysts.

Any suggestion that the transaction could lead to anticompetitive effects is ""completely absurd,"" the spokesperson added.Shares of Activision fell about 2% in extended trading after closing 1% higher.Microsoft, maker of the Xbox game console, announced in January the deal to buy Activision, the maker of ""Call of Duty"" and ""Candy Crush"" games, in the biggest gaming industry deal in history as global technology giants staked their claims to a virtual future.Microsoft is betting on the acquisition to help it compete better with videogame leaders Tencent and Sony.The deal is also facing scrutiny outside the U.S. The EU opened a full-scale investigation earlier this month. The EU competition enforcer said it would decide by March 23, 2023, whether to clear or block the deal.Britain's antitrust watchdog in September said it would launch a full-scale probe.The acquisition could damage the industry if Microsoft refused to give rivals access to Activision's best-selling games, Britain's antitrust regulator has said.The deal has drawn criticism from Sony, maker of the Playstation console, citing Microsoft's control of games like ""Call of Duty.""Story continues""Sony, as the industry leader, says it is worried about 'Call of Duty,' but we've said we are committed to making the same game available on the same day on both Xbox and PlayStation,"" Microsoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith has said.A spokesperson for Microsoft said: ""We are prepared to address the concerns of regulators, including the FTC, and Sony to ensure the deal closes with confidence.

    Wednesday, Nov. 23, 2022Tech companies are cutting back on moonshots. That could be a mistake.Part of the mystique of Silicon Valley comes from the wild moonshot ideas its tech giants think up. From smart refrigerators to self-driving cars to intelligent speakers, major tech firms have thought up and delivered seemingly improbable products over the years.But investing in the research and development for those kinds of ideas costs billions. And that kind of spending can become a liability as companies shed thousands of jobs and slash budgets.In June, Bloomberg reported that Meta (META) scrapped its planned dual-camera smartwatch, while Snap (SNAP) ended its experiment with its selfie drone. In September, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) ended its gambit to become a gaming company.According to Business Insider, Amazon’s Alexa division, which has been hit hard by layoffs, is on track to cost the company $10 billion in 2022, with no clear signs it’ll ever be a profit engine.“They are making painful choices … because of the nature of the economic and funding environment,” Andrew Wu, assistant director of business administration at Harvard Business School, told Yahoo Finance.“These moonshot divisions represent the hopes and dreams of where these executives want the company to go. But sometimes you can't pursue the dream, and you've got to focus on keeping the company afloat.”But axing ambitious projects can set companies back for years in terms of innovation, even if there’s little chance those products will ever succeed. And if the big tech companies don’t make those investments, smaller upstart rivals might take the chance and eventually unseat today’s titans. Just as Google and Apple (AAPL) pushed Microsoft (MSFT) aside in the smartphone wars.Story continuesTech companies need to innovate to grow“The term moonshot has a connotation of being something that is both highly improbable and something that is potentially awe inspiring,” said Christopher E. Krohn, adjunct professor of marketing at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Visitors at Amazon Alexa boot during the international electronics and innovation fair IFA in Berlin on September 10, 2019. (Photo by Emmanuele Contini/NurPhoto via Getty Images)“It's a very large or longer term objective that also has a relatively low probability of success,” he added.In order for tech companies like Meta, Amazon (AMZN), Google, Microsoft to continue growing, they need to make investments in experimental products. Whether that’s Meta’s $10 billion per year bet on the metaverse, Amazon’s plan to conquer the smart home with Alexa, or Google parent Alphabet’s self-driving Waymo.The idea is that without pumping money into experimental projects and products, even those that eventually fail, companies will become stagnant or miss out on entire technology revolutions.Microsoft and Meta missed out on the smartphone age and lost out on what could have been billions in sales. Microsoft whiffed because it was too focused on fighting the U.S. government's antitrust suit, and Meta was simply too late to the game. Now both companies have to rely on Apple and Google's operating systems to play in the smartphone space.To avert similar disasters, the two companies are investing heavily in headsets and the metaverse with the hopes that their own platforms become the next ubiquitous devices we can’t live without.But those plans often take years to pan out, if at all. And at a time when companies are cutting back on costs, those big bets that could hold the keys to businesses’ futures are in accountants’ crosshairs.Innovation is pricey, especially when it failsYuxi Wang, a product marketing manager at Meta, demonstrates using the oculus headset with the Horizons Work Rooms program during a preview of the inaugural physical store of Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc in Burlingame, California, U.S. May 4, 2022. REUTERS/Brittany Hosea-SmallWhile Amazon’s Alexa isn’t a traditional moonshot, it’s been on the market in a variety of forms for years, it’s struggled to make the company cash. Consumers were originally supposed to use their Alexa-powered devices to make hands-free purchases via Amazon Prime.But that hasn’t exactly worked out, and most people use their Alexa-enabled gadgets to do things like play music or set timers. And while Amazon says it’s still interested in investing in its own hardware and intelligent assistant, its Alexa division has been hit hard by the company’s recent job cuts.Snap’s $230 Pixy drone, meanwhile, was on the market for just four months before the company sent the pint-sized device to an early grave. In addition to its smartwatch, code-named Milan, Meta has also killed off its Portal line of video chat devices, as well as two other smartwatches, according to The Verge.As for Google, after trying to launch its own game studio and Stadia cloud gaming service, it’s ended both ventures.“Right now, for companies to pursue stuff that is really out there, that doesn't have a logical pathway to solving somebody's problem…it's probably a good thing to get rid of that product,” explained Forrester VP and principal analyst J.P. Gownder.Still, companies have no choice but to plow money into potential hits. If they don’t they could end up falling to the wayside as smaller firms overtake them.“If you're also not investing in bigger, more breakthrough, next-generation projects, you might get completely knocked off the mat by somebody else who is,” explained Melissa Schilling, professor of management at New York University’s Stern School of Business.If today’s tech giants are going to continue to hold onto their positions as the most innovative companies in the world, they’ll need to make the right investments and take risks that might sound wild today. If they don’t, they could end up the hasbeens of tomorrow.By Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Data Mining Companies in the World. Data mining is one of the most important industries today, particularly when it comes to corporate functioning. Modern day businesses generate unfathomable amounts of data daily, and this information is useless unless the right set of tools is used to generate and deliver insights.The process, called data mining, is crucial to the operation of both large and small businesses. Its importance is clear when we take a look at market value and growth estimates. This market rivals the value of established and dominating industries such as crude oil, with a research report from Fortune Business Insights outlining that the process mining software market will be worth $933 million by the end of this year, and despite this sizeable value, it will nevertheless grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 49.5% to sit at a whopping $15,546.4 million by 2029. Process mining is similar to data mining, and it involves using tools to specifically map out business processes and generate insights for improvement. The growth and scope of the industry are understood better when statistics are taken into account.As Fortune Business Insights states, according to Accenture, 88% of businesses that used machine learning saw a 200% improvement in their operations. Machine learning is an advanced form of data mining that leverages large data sets to decipher patterns. These are then used to predict future outcomes, such as banking fraud or equipment downtimes and failures. According to the research firm, Europe will dominate the sector in terms of market value, while North America will be the fastest growing. These conclusions are in stark contrast with estimates for other segments that have often pegged Asia Pacific as the fastest growing region for a variety of industries such as consumer technology.Story continuesThis article casts a wide net and it looks at a host of data mining companies, such as those which provide the software and those that power the software with the hardware along with others that utilize data mining for their daily operations.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Barrett Business Services and Paychex are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy), respectively, right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that BBSI has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.BBSI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.03, while PAYX has a forward P/E of 29.18. We also note that BBSI has a PEG ratio of 1.07. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PAYX currently has a PEG ratio of 3.89.Another notable valuation metric for BBSI is its P/B ratio of 4. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, PAYX has a P/B of 14.10.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to BBSI's Value grade of B and PAYX's Value grade of C.Story continuesBBSI has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than PAYX, so it seems like value investors will conclude that BBSI is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But, that's not always the case. Walmart's retail warehouse branch Sam's Club has their own brand of products called Member's Mark. Member's Mark products make up about 20% of Sam's Club inventory, and are sometimes just as good as name brand items, and are available for a fraction of the price.

At Sam's Club, 40 oz. of Starbucks Pike Place Roast will cost you $21.93. However, the Member's Mark Classic Roast goes for $11.98 and contains eight more ounces of coffee than the Starbucks bag. Member's Mark Classic Roast Ground Coffee is made with hand-picked red Arabica beans, which are the same type of beans Starbucks uses in their blend.Take Our Poll: How Do You Typically Split the Restaurant Bill?Magdalena Kucova / Shutterstock.comMaple SyrupPure maple syrup is absolutely delicious--and expensive.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, McKesson Corp. MCK, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM and Merck &amp; Co. Inc. MRK.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Buy These 5 Corporate Giants Flying High in a Disappointing 2022Less than six weeks of trading are left to complete 2022, which has been rather disappointing. Throughout the year, the inflation rate has stayed at a 40-year high due to the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system, which has been complicated further by the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict. Demand has remained rock solid owing to the unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus given in the last two pandemic-ridden years.Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 7.3%, 17.1% and 29.5%, respectively. Despite these headwinds, several corporate bigwigs have flourished this year with more upside left. Five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., McKesson Corp., Marathon Petroleum Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Merck &amp; Co. Inc.Peak Inflation Seems Behind UsOn Nov 10, the Department of Labor reported that the consumer price index (CPI) in October rose 0.4% month over month and 7.7% year over year. The consensus estimate was for a month-over-month rise of 0.5% and a year-over-year gain of 7.9%Core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) increased 0.3% month over month and 6.3% year over year. The consensus estimate was for a rise of 0.5% month over month and 6.5% year over year.On Nov 15, the Department of Labor reported that the producer price index (PPI) increased 0.2% in October compared with the consensus estimate of a 0.5% rise. September's data was revised downward from 0.4% to 0.2%.Story continuesYear over year, PPI rose 8%, dropping from the 8.4% rise in September. Core PPI increased 0.2% in October compared with the consensus estimate of 0.4%. Year over year, core PPI rose 5.4% in October.In third-quarter 2022, the chain-weighted price index — a cost-of-living index adjusted for consumer behavior — rose 4.1%, well below the consensus estimate of a 5.3% gain. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased 4.2%, exhibiting a sharp fall from 7.3% in the second quarter. The core PCE price index — Fed's favorite inflation gauge — rose 4.5% in the third quarter, in line with market expectations.As peak inflation seems behind us, the Fed is likely to relax its tighter monetary control. The central bank is expected to reduce the magnitude of the interest rate hike from the December FOMC meeting. This will help the overall equity market.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital &gt; $50 billion) that have popped year to date. These stocks have solid growth potential for the rest of 2022 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Archer-Daniels-Midland has been gaining from solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations. Persistent growth in the Nutrition segment of ADM, aided by significant gains in the Human and Animal Nutrition units, remains the key growth driver.Archer-Daniels-Midland expects the nutrition segment to record operating profit growth of 20% in 2022.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 7.4% over the last 30 days. The stock price of ADM has surged 42.2% year to date.Marathon Petroleum is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC's $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC's exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.Zacks Rank #1 Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.3 % over the last seven days. The stock price of MPC has soared 88% year to date.McKesson provides pharmaceuticals and medical supplies in the United States and internationally.

The stock price of MCK has climbed 48.3% year to date.Exxon Mobil's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure, which have historically led to industry-leading returns, make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. The integrated oil giant expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in its upstream business.At the same time, XOM expects to reduce flaring and methane emissions by 40%.

With continued label expansion into new indications and early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver of MRK.Animal health and vaccine products are the core growth drivers. Merck's new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, should be a key top-line driver in 2022. MRK boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth.Zacks Rank #2 Merck has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.6% for the current year.

70,9b43f717-c91c-3617-81d4-b34eecb444e8,ADM,2022-11-24,5 Solid Dividend Growth Stocks for Thanksgiving,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-solid-dividend-growth-stocks-130301590.html,1669208581,STORY,['ADM'],"[Thanksgiving is coming up, and it’s time to stuff dividend stocks with strong growth prospects in your portfolio for market-beating returns. This is especially true as the holiday-shortened week is usually a bullish feast for stock investors, even with low volumes, as consumer spending is expected to rise.Stocks with a history of dividend growth year over year form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ADM, McKesson Corporation MCK, ParkerHannifin Corporation PH, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation BAH and Darden Restaurants Inc. DRI  — that could be compelling picks for your portfolio this Thanksgiving.Inside Dividend Growth StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environments.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 18.Here are five of the 18 stocks that fit the bill:Illinois-based Archer-Daniels is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products.

72,71d62ca0-cff0-360d-b7fd-7a889bea49e0,PM,2022-11-24,Are Investors Undervaluing Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) By 46%?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-philip-morris-international-110010373.html,1669287610,STORY,['PM'],"[How far off is Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.58bUS$10.1bUS$11.2bUS$11.8bUS$12.3bUS$12.7bUS$13.1bUS$13.4bUS$13.7bUS$14.0bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.99%Est @ 3.39%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.67%Est @ 2.46%Est @ 2.32% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% US$9.0kUS$9.0kUS$9.4kUS$9.3kUS$9.1kUS$8.9kUS$8.6kUS$8.4kUS$8.1kUS$7.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$88bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.0%) = US$349bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$349b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$193bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$281b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$98.1, the company appears quite good value at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Philip Morris International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Philip Morris International, we've put together three additional items you should further examine:Risks: Take risks, for example - Philip Morris International has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does PM's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

(GSAM) failed to follow policies and procedures for certain environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment products.The SEC uncovered procedural failures involving the ESG research used to select and monitor securities from April 2017 to February 2020.The company did not have written policies from April 2017 until June 2018 for ESG research in one product. Even when such policies and procedures were established, it was not consistently followed until February 2020.GSAM’s established policies and procedures required its personnel to complete a questionnairefor every company to screen investments before adding them to funds or other portfolios. However, the ESG questionnaires were filled after securities were already selected for inclusion in many instances.With investors increasingly preferring ESG investments, the branding and marketing of such funds and strategies have increased. Sanjay Wadhwa, deputy director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement and head of its Climate and ESG Task Force stated that in such cases investment advisors “must establish reasonable policies and procedures governing how the ESG factors will be evaluated as part of the investment process, and then follow those policies and procedures, to avoid providing investors with information about these products that differs from their practices.”Goldman faces many investigations and lawsuits from investors and regulators. Such unresolved lawsuits are expected to lead to increased expenses and litigation provisions.Also, supply chain issues, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia and significant monetary tightening globally to control raging inflation have affected stock prices and slowed global economic growth. With companies veering away from mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) and debt and equity issuances, GS’ investment banking business is expected to remain subdued.Story continuesSo far this year, shares of GS have inched up 0.3% against the industry's 7% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt carries a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold) at present.Stocks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are Capital Southwest CSWC and AssetMark Financial AMK.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Capital Southwest’s current fiscal year earnings has moved up 4.3% in the past 30 days.

Amazon will release a smaller number of films in theaters next year and increase its output over time. That number of releases puts it on on a par with major studios such as Paramount Pictures.Streaming services have eschewed theaters with most of their original movies, or released the titles for less time and on fewer screens than traditional movie studios. Netflix Inc. in particular has aggravated cinema chains by releasing more than a movie a week for viewers at home. The streaming giant released a sequel to Knives Out in theaters on Wednesday. It will stay there for just one week, however, before heading to streaming next month. The original film grossed $312.9 million theatrically in 2019.Amazon has been more open to theaters than Netflix, but has yet to invest as much money in original movies. While Netflix releases close to 100 movies a year, Amazon puts out just a couple dozen, many in languages other than English.“Amazon.com’s plans to invest $1 billion to produce 12-15 movies a year for release in cinemas is a vote of confidence in the theatrical model,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Geetha Ranganathan wrote Wednesday in a note. It could “easily boost receipts by 15%-20% given Universal and Warner have roughly similar budgets.”Story continuesThe news lifted shares of theater operators. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., the largest chain, rose as much as 9.2% to $7.99 in New York. Cinemark Holdings Inc. advanced as much as 12% to $13.78.Even though Amazon is in a cost-cutting mode, the company is ramping up its investment in original movies following the $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM, a 98-year-old Hollywood studio that released Ben-Hur and Legally Blonde. Its franchises include Rocky and James Bond, which it releases in conjunction with the family of producer Albert Broccoli. MGM’s two top film executives, Michael DeLuca and Pam Abdy, left Amazon just a month after it acquired the company, and Amazon Studios chief Jennifer Salke has been looking for an executive to run the film business.Salke’s boss, Mike Hopkins, met with candidates including Emma Watts, formerly of Fox and Paramount, and Sean Bailey, an executive at Walt Disney Co. But Salke has taken control of the search for the job, which will now report to her instead of Hopkins.Amazon first got the attention of the movie business by acquiring projects at the Sundance Film Festival and releasing them in thousands of theaters for months, a cycle that resembled those of a traditional studio. It earned Academy Award nominations for The Big Sick and Manchester by the Sea. While those movies delighted critics, they were only modest successes at the box office.Salke went on a buying spree of her own at Sundance in 2019 after taking the helm of Amazon’s Hollywood operations. But Amazon shifted its release strategy to prioritize its streaming service.Founder Jeff Bezos has also pushed his Hollywood studio to develop and release more commercial material, which led to the recent The Lord of the Rings TV series, as well as projects like The Terminal List, a show starring Chris Pratt. All of the streaming companies, including Netflix and Apple, have invested more money in original TV before progressing to film.Theaters will welcome the new product from Amazon, whenever it comes. US ticket sales are down more than 33% from 2019, the last full year before the pandemic closed theaters. Many of the biggest movie studios are part of companies that have started releasing original movies online to boost their streaming services.Yet despite declining ticket sales, filmmakers, Hollywood veterans and talent representatives are all pushing for media companies to embrace theaters. They believe a big hit in theaters, such as Top Gun: Maverick, is more lucrative than even the biggest streaming movie.(Updates with analyst’s comment)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekCar Price Divergence Hints at More Painful Inflation AheadApple’s Reliance on China Grows Perilous With Chaos in iPhone CityProfessor Behind Effective Altruism on What SBF’s Fall MeansThe Robot Tractors Are Coming, Just as Soon as We Crush a Few BugsElon Musk Keeps Quoting Elon Musk About His Genius©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

In South Korea and France, it will be available from 2023.Top Gun: Maverick had a blockbuster performance across theatres as it remained in the top five on domestic box office charts for 14 of the 15 weeks since release in America.The film also set a holiday record with its $160.5 million debut and became Tom Cruise’s first movie to surpass $100 million in a single weekend, as well as his first to cross $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales.The movie gained traction and received huge support from fans on the big screen and the same is anticipated as it now heads towards its OTT launch.Paramount+ Aids GrowthParamount has been focused on setting a strong pipeline of movies and shows for its viewers on the streaming platform.The company recently unveiled its plans to celebrate the 50th anniversary of hip hop music and culture, for which Paramount+ will offer 50 of the most iconic episodes of MTV Entertainment’s original series Yo! MTV Raps for the first time since it premiered and episodes from the home-makeover series, Hip Hop My House.Paramount+ also announced the revival of the popular FBI drama, Criminal Minds.

It has plans to introduce Paramount+ in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and in France with Canal+ this year.Story continuesWhat Lies Ahead for Paramount?Despite the wide expansion, Paramount faces certain headwinds. Advertisers continue to deal with macroeconomic challenges like inflation, higher interest rates and unfavourable forex with the U.S. dollar strengthening.

Buying pressure accelerated Tuesday afternoon, as all sectors found positive territory and built on recent gains.Markets were able to look past Kansas City Fed President Esther George’s comments when she stated that the Fed may “need to raise interest rates to a higher level and hold them there longer.” Despite the hawkish Fed comments along with a continued COVID-19 resurgence in China, stocks were able to muster a sizeable rally at a critical juncture.Today is the busiest day of the week, kicking off with the October durable goods report. Orders at American factories for long-lasting goods rose 1% last month, ahead of the 0.5% estimate. It’s a sign that certain pockets of the economy continue to show strength despite lingering inflation and an aggressive Fed.We’ll also get fresh November readings on the U.S. flash purchasing managers’ index (PMI) as well as consumer sentiment. Of course, minutes from the Fed’s November rate-setting meeting are due out later this afternoon.With markets beginning to pick up steam and both the dollar and bond yields showing weakness, investors need to be ready to pull the trigger with an actionable list of buyable stocks.Highly-Ranked Zacks Stocks Showing Relative StrengthThe energy trade appears to have legs despite an extraordinary rally this year. One stock that continues to hit new 52-week highs is Marathon Petroleum MPC. A Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), MPC trades relatively undervalued at just a 4.68 forward P/E. The oil and gas refiner has exceeded earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters with an average 60% surprise.

A Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), ARRY has surpassed earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 82.14%. Analysts have increased 2023 earnings estimates for ARRY by 3.33% in the past 60 days. Next year’s Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate stands at $0.93/share, reflecting potential growth of 180.63% relative to this year.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOf course, technology makes up a large part of the market, and while tech companies have been lagging most of the year, they’ll need to bounce back to life for a sustained rally to take hold. Streaming giant Netflix NFLX has one of the more constructive-looking charts out of the FAANG names, with NFLX appearing to have bottomed back in May and now making a series of higher highs. Netflix has beaten earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 35.09%. NFLX stock has advanced more than 70% off the lows.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhere Things Stand in the PresentThe major indices put together a nice rally at key levels yesterday and will look to build on the momentum as we head into the Thanksgiving holiday. There’s still a lot of bears out there, something that may help push this rally into December.More and more stocks are beginning to break out and trade above their respective 50 and 200-day moving averages, a sign that breadth is improving.

(NFLX) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-netflix-inc-nflx-140002906.html,1669212002,STORY,['NFLX'],"[Netflix (NFLX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this internet video service have returned -1.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.9% change. The Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, to which Netflix belongs, has lost 1.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $0.49 per share, indicating a change of -63.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.27 points to a change of -8.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.78 indicates a change of +4.9% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NFLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Netflix, the consensus sales estimate of $7.85 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.8%. The $31.58 billion and $33.92 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.3% and +7.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNetflix reported revenues of $7.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.9%. EPS of $3.10 for the same period compares with $3.19 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.85 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1%. The EPS surprise was +46.92%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Netflix is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(BOOT)—a specialty retailer offering increasingly popular Western and work-related apparel, footwear and accessories. Boots are somewhat resistant to online competition because they often require specialized fitting. The company has benefited from its economies of scale and multi-channel business model, which have kept revenues flowing during virus-related shutdowns. Stimulus payments by the federal government to consumers have helped as well. Boot Barn’s private-label brands, built around well-known personalities in the music business, have enabled the company to convert higher portions of its revenues into bottom-line profits. For most of the period since March 2020, Boot Barn’s stock rallied on these positive conditions—and this rally continued in the fourth quarter. We consider Boot Barn’s management to be excellent, and we’ve continually added to our position on periodic price weakness within the context of an overall upward trajectory in the stock.”6.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) insiders disposed of US$5.2m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-amgen-inc-120020995.html,1669291220,STORY,['AMGN'],"[The fact that multiple Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Amgen Amgen Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP, Jonathan Graham, for US$3.3m worth of shares, at about US$242 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$283, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 40% of Jonathan Graham's stake.Insiders in Amgen didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Amgen Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Amgen shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$273k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Amgen insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$241m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The Amgen Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold Amgen shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Amgen makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Amgen you should know about.Of course Amgen may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Still trading 28% from its highs, this week’s Black Friday shopping weekend could continue boosting Macy’s stock. More and more investors may be wondering if it’s time to buy the department store stock.Let’s take a look at what’s been going on with Macy’s stock lately to get a better answer.Recent Performance Macy’s stock is up roughly 19% since blasting Q3 expectations last week. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 173% with EPS at $0.52 per share. Its earnings were down 58% from the prior-year quarter, but somewhat impressive under challenging operating environments. Sales of $5.23 billion were down 3.9% YoY but beat top line expectations by 1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of Macy’s are now up 17% over the last month with better-than-expected October CPI numbers giving broader markets a push in recent weeks as well. Still, M stock has largely outperformed during this period as shown in the above chart.The rally is much applauded as fears have mounted for years that e-commerce companies like Amazon AMZN and new-age retailers may slowly but surely put Macy’s out of business.OutlookYear over year, M’s earnings are now expected to drop -21% in its fiscal 2023 and another -3% in FY24 at $4.04 per share. Earnings estimates for FY23 have trended up after positive Q3 results last week while FY24 revisions have declined. The Zacks estimate for FY23 is now up to $4.17 per share compared to $4.14 a share while FY24 estimates have declined from $4.14 to $4.04 a share.Sales are projected to be flat in FY23 and virtually flat in FY24 as well at $24.62 billion. FY24 sales projections would represent a -4% decrease from pre-pandemic levels, with 2019 sales at $25.73 billion. The declining growth has made some investors cautious about Macy’s ability to adapt and compete within the new age of retail. However, Macy’s stock is reasonably valued and is having a rebound-type performance over the last two years.Story continuesPerformance &amp; ValuationMacy’s is down -10% YTD to outperform the S&amp;P 500’s -17% and underperform the Retail-Regional Department Stores Market’s -3%.

This is an extravagant and expensive American tradition like no other.Holiday Spending: Get Top Holiday Shopping and Savings TipsAdvice: If Your Credit Score Is Under 740, Make These 4 Moves Now""The 2022 installment of the annual event will feature more than 5,000 volunteers, 16 giant balloons, 28 floats, over 700 clowns, 12 marching bands, 10 performance groups and a bevy of musical stars,"" according to Today.Here's a look at the preparation that goes into this annual event in a year's time, along with float costs and other expenses associated with this iconic Thanksgiving Day celebration. The total only adds to the big bucks Americans already spend on this holiday.a katz / Shutterstock.com1. Annual Costs for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Can Exceed $13 MillionAnnual costs for parade float supplies, float decorations, property taxes, and staff salaries typically total $2.7 million to $4.5 million. The sheer magnitude of the Macy's parade is overwhelming, and so are the assets associated with the event.Macy's also has its own studio space and a massive supply of costumes to prepare for the parade. These assets are worth $8.9 million on any given year, outside of 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Combined annual expenses and assets alone can push above $13 million some years.Take Our Poll: Do You Think People Should Invest In Crypto?lev radin / Shutterstock.com2. Giant Balloons Rack Up Costs of $510,000Inflating balloons that can stretch up to five or six stories high is seriously expensive. Each balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving parade uses 300,000 to 700,000 cubic feet of helium. Filling every balloon costs a minimum of $510,000.Each helium-filled giant requires 80 to 100 volunteer handlers, but sometimes that still isn't enough to prevent them from going astray.In 1997, winds up to 43 mph damaged several balloons--including Barney, The Pink Panther, Quik Bunny and the Cat in the Hat, forcing them to exit the parade route early.Story continuesThe weather is something the parade organizers are going to have to keep an eye on this year, because the forecast for the morning of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade calls for a chance of showers.Scott Cornell / Shutterstock.com3. New Balloons Cost Sponsors $190,000Companies sponsoring brand new balloons pay a construction and parade fee of $190,000. The cost might be high, but advertising at the Thanksgiving parade is a huge marketing opportunity, and there's no shortage of businesses willing to shell out the cash.gary718 / Shutterstock.com4. Returning Sponsors Pay $90,000 for BalloonsSponsoring a balloon in the Macy's parade is a big investment, so many sponsors opt to participate for several years. In these cases a new balloon doesn't need to be constructed, so the fee drops to $90,000.Favorites from years past, including Ronald McDonald, Spongebob, the Pillsbury Doughboy, and Funko Pop!-inspired Grogu (a.k.a. Baby Yoda), are planned to return for 2022's parade.Snoopy will also be back this Thanksgiving, proving to be the mainstay character year after year in the parade, appearing more than any other balloon in the history of the Macy's tradition. After 2022's parade, Snoopy will have had 42 appearances and ""a record eight different designs since his debut in 1968. His previous iterations include Flying Ace Snoopy, Astronaut Snoopy, and Millennium Snoopy.""Alexiuz / Shutterstock.com5. Construction Costs for Each Float Average $30,000 to $100,000You won't find your average parade floats in the Macy's event--those on display here can take four to nine months to get from concept to completion. Parade float supply costs add up fast! This year, the Macy's Day Parade is expected to use 240 gallons of paint, 200 pounds of confetti, and 300 pounds of glitter.The 2022 parade plans to introduce 5 new floats to add to their classic line up, including ""Baby Shark"" by Pinkfong and Nickelodeon, ""Geoffrey's Dazzling Dance Party"" by Toys ""R"" Us, ""People of First Light"" by Macy's, ""Supersized Slumber"" by Netflix and ""The Wondership"" by Wonder.This year a total of 28 extravagant floats will be in the parade. The average construction costs typically range from $30,000 to $100,000 per float.JStone / Shutterstock.com6. Costumes Have a Total Price Tag of $2 millionThe perfect parade float doesn't just boast beautiful construction. About 700 elaborate costumes are designed in a normal year to bring parade float ideas to life. Costumes currently in storage are valued at $2 million. Balloon handlers wear jumpsuits, but those riding on floats are provided with custom-made garments, according to Business Insider.On a typical Thanksgiving Day, 200 costume fitters are on-site to help participants into their outfits. When the parade is over, costumes are packed into 10 trucks and sent back to the warehouse.Stuart Monk / Shutterstock.com7. Advance Ticket Sales for Participating Broadway Shows Have Climbed $300,000Broadway shows vie for the chance to step into the national spotlight and perform in the Macy's parade. The exposure has boosted advance ticket sales by roughly $300,000 in the past.This year, the cast of the Broadway musical ""Funny Girl,"" headed by actress Lea Michele, will kick off the parade's opening number. Other performances will be helmed by the casts of ""The Lion King,"" ""Some Like It Hot, and ""A Beautiful Noise.""And of course, the Radio City Rockettes will be performing, too!a katz / Shutterstock.com8. Property Taxes Total More Than $138,000Even the Thanksgiving parade can't get away from the taxman. Previously located in Hoboken, New Jersey, the Macy's Parade Studio completed work on its new Moonachie, New Jersey, home in 2011. The 72,000-square-foot, $6.9 million building is nearly double the size of its previous 40,000-square-foot facility.A tremendous amount of space is needed to house each parade float, balloon, costume and accessory and still have room for employees. Large facilities come with considerable expenses, which can explain the sky-high property tax bill of $138,573.U.S. Navy / Wikimedia Commons9. Salaries for Full-Time Staffers Total $1.3 millionDespite taking place just once a year on Thanksgiving Day, the Macy's parade is an enormous undertaking that requires a full-time staff of 26 employees.Temporary staffers are hired during the busy fall months, bringing the total employee count to roughly 40, bringing the combined salaries to a whopping total of about $1.3 million.The Macy's parade team includes painters, sculptors, carpenters, construction workers, metal workers and more. Employees start working long hours--including weekends--in September to make sure all preparations are in place for the big day.Scott Cornell / Shutterstock.com10. Marching Bands Must Apply Two Years in AdvanceFor marching bands, it's quite an honor to be selected to perform in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The application process requires careful planning, as materials must be submitted nearly two years before the desired performance date.Only 12 supremely talented marching bands are selected each year. However, all high school and college marching bands originally chosen to perform in the 2022 Macy's Parade were selected in 2021 from applications submitted in 2020.If the process remains the same, next year's submissions will end in early February for bands chosen for the 2024 festivities.Goran Bogicevic / Shutterstock.com11. More Than 50 Million People Watch the ParadeAround 50 million viewers tune into the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade from home each year, making it one of the biggest annual televised events in America.Another estimated 3.5 million revelers are predicted to head to the streets of New York City to watch the parade in person.Putting these numbers into perspective, the 2022 NBA Finals attracted nearly 14 million viewers for Game Six.a katz / Shutterstock.com12. The Macy's Parade Is the Joint Effort of 10,000 PeoplePutting on an event as large as the Macy's parade requires a tremendous amount of assistance. A total of 10,000 people work together to make it a success--logging an estimated 50,000+ hours of labor in all-including Macy's employees who volunteer their time to the parade.From the artists who create the enormous helium balloons to the people who work all night to assemble the floats after they arrive in Manhattan, this is a major team effort. It's probably safe to assume things get a little hectic at crunch time, but viewers never know it.lev radin / Shutterstock.com13. More Than 5,000 Macy's Employees Volunteer on Thanksgiving MorningMany people wouldn't consider offering to work on Thanksgiving morning. However, more than 5,000 people from across the Northeast volunteer their time to the parade, a number that keeps going up each year. These volunteers serve in a wide variety of roles, including balloon handlers and balloon pilots.Despite the sheer volume of volunteers, each person is assigned a costume to wear during the parade. Operations are so well organized that each volunteer can get dressed and ready within a two-hour window.karmakazesal / Flickr.com14. Thanksgiving Day Parade Marchers Total 10,000Considering roughly 10,000 people march in the Macy's parade in a typical year, it might seem easy to join in the fun, but it's not. Since this Thanksgiving tradition launched in 1924, participation has been limited to Macy's employees, their families and those with relationships to sponsors or others affiliated with the event.Performing talent is the only exception to the rule. There are no reserved tickets available to purchase for the grandstand seating area, so arrive early if you want to stake out a good spot -- in 2021, that is.More From GOBankingRatesHow Long $1 Million in Retirement Will Last in Every StateGOBankingRates' Best Credit Cards for 2023If Your Credit Score is Under 740, Make These 4 Moves NowBest Business Credit CardsJennifer Taylor contributed to the reporting for this article.This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Much Does a Float in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade Cost?]"

To skip the industry analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Electrical Companies in the USA.Utility stocks such as electric utilities are among the favorites of conservative investors, especially during a recession. These stocks have a low beta, which means market volatility doesn’t affect them much.Utility companies are heavily regulated, due to which the number of competitors of these companies is fewer compared to other sectors of the market. This allows investors to easily predict the revenues and profits of these companies.Up until mid-September, utility companies, including electrical companies, were among the best-performing stocks of 2022. Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU) had a 5% return while S&amp;P 500 had declined by 18% YTD. However, in October, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes showed their effects on the sector and the fund kept falling for several sessions and was the worst-performing sector among 11 S&amp;P industry groups. Janney analyst Michael Gaugler believes the current year could be disappointing for the utility sector and industry ""is likely to rally once the U.S. Federal Reserve signals its rate hike policy is coming to a close.""In the future, the utility sector should rally due to the aggressive adoption of electric vehicles and the Biden administration’s clean energy and infrastructure legislation.Future OutlookThe power generation market size was around $1.39 trillion in 2020 and is expected to reach $1.83 trillion by 2028 at a CAGR of 3.53%. According to the World Energy Outlook 2019, the global electric utility demand is expected to increase at the rate of 2.1% per annum till 2040, and the electricity demand is set to double by 2050.The utility market has always benefited during recessionary times as seen in the 2001 and 2007-09 recessions.

Per the terms of the deal, the Pets Best subsidiary of the former will extend the benefits of its insurance plans to the annual veterinary care members of the latter. The offering named Dutch x Pets Best insurance plan can be availed at the website of Dutch. The enhanced pet insurance plan formed as a result of integrating Pets Best’s Accident Only insurance plan with the all-time online veterinary care services of Dutch is likely to deliver an array of cost-effective and virtual care solutions for pets’ urgent and daily care needs.The new offering aims to simplify the pet insurance process, wherein pet parents can easily meet treatment expenses or other costs related to owning a pet that often generates financial stress. In case of pet accidents calling for emergency in-person attention, the insurance plan will serve as a cushion for pet parents. The recent tie-up reflects Synchrony’s sincere efforts to strengthen its presence across the U.S. pet insurance market. The market holds promising prospects, driven by growing demand for pet insurance plans to minimize the out-of-pocket costs for serious illnesses or unanticipated injuries. Per BlueWeave Consulting, the U.S. pet insurance market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 10.6% over the 2022-2028 forecast period.As the leading telemedicine, tailored treatment plans and prescription medications provider for pets across most U.S. states, Dutch seems to be the apt partner for complementing SYF’s endeavor.

These companies are some of the biggest and best-known stocks in the market. That makes finding the best large-cap stocks a worthy exercise.Of course, in this market, it can be a challenge to identify the best large-cap stocks. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 16% and other major indices down more than that, you just can’t throw darts at a board to find your winners.For this list, I use my Portfolio Grader exclusive tool to find the best large-cap stocks to buy and hold.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe Portfolio Grader assigns stocks a letter grade based on fundamentals such as sales growth and operating margin. And its factors in buying pressure and  other quantitative factors that help predict a stock’s future performance.Here are seven large-cap stocks to buy and hold that get strong ratings from the Portfolio Grader.ELVElevance Health$495.32WMTWalmart$150.23AAPLApple$151.29RTXRaytheon Technologies$95.36QCOMQualcomm$123.85MELIMercadoLibre$962.08JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$176.20Elevance Health (ELV)A health insurance claim form with a stethoscope, a calculator, and several hundred dollar bills resting on top.Source: Valeri Potapova / Shutterstock.comFormerly known as Anthem, Elevance Health (NYSE:ELV) is the largest for-profit company providing health insurance under the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand. All and all, it’s one of the top-rated large-cap stocks to make a long-term holding.Although it’s still moving higher, as the market pulls back, ELV stock trades at a favorable valuation (15x forward earnings). It can easily sustain this earnings multiple, as it’s expected to continue growing its earnings per share by around 12.8% next year, and by about 13.6% in 2024.Elevance could continue to climb, in tandem with increased EPS. Its current forward yield of 1.05% may seem tiny, yet in time, it could grow to become mighty. Its low payout ratio (15.7%) leaves ample room for dividend growth.Story continuesThis stock earns an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.Walmart (WMT)A photo of the Walmart (WMT) logo on the side of a truck.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comWith about 10,500 stores and clubs around the world, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is one of the biggest retailers on the planet.

Although prices were relatively low, insiders chose to sell US$13m worth of stock in the past 12 months. This could be a sign of impending weakness.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Lockheed MartinOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, for US$3.5m worth of shares, at about US$438 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$481, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was 100% of Frank St. John's holding.In total, Lockheed Martin insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Lockheed Martin Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyIt's good to see that Lockheed Martin insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. We can see that insider John Donovan paid US$251k for shares in the company. No-one sold. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that Lockheed Martin insiders own 0.07% of the company, worth about US$84m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Lockheed Martin Tell Us?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. On the other hand the transaction history, over the last year, isn't so positive. The more recent transactions are a positive, but Lockheed Martin insiders haven't shown the sustained enthusiasm that we look for, although they do own a decent number of shares, overall. In short they are likely aligned with shareholders. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Lockheed Martin. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin you should know about.Of course Lockheed Martin may not be the best stock to buy.

The correction letter was updated last month to include actions healthcare practitioners could undertake in case they encountered any malfunction or interference.The device was found to interfere with other nearby critical devices such as infusion pumps, insulin pumps, blood glucose sensors and bladder scanners, among others.The Food and Drug Administration said the interference from WatchCare may lead to erroneous reading or malfunctions on other devices, causing inappropriate medical treatment for patients.Baxter, which makes smart hospital beds, recalled 8,550 WatchCare devices distributed between Aug. 1, 2018 and Sept. 1, 2022.The recall was based on 96 reported complaints of interference with no reports of injuries or death related to the product, the FDA said.Baxter said it has sought location and removal of the device from clinical care areas, where possible.Many of the recalled WatchCare devices were manufactured by Hillrom, which was acquired by Baxter in late 2021.

These companies are some of the biggest and best-known stocks in the market. That makes finding the best large-cap stocks a worthy exercise.Of course, in this market, it can be a challenge to identify the best large-cap stocks. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 16% and other major indices down more than that, you just can’t throw darts at a board to find your winners.For this list, I use my Portfolio Grader exclusive tool to find the best large-cap stocks to buy and hold.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe Portfolio Grader assigns stocks a letter grade based on fundamentals such as sales growth and operating margin. And its factors in buying pressure and  other quantitative factors that help predict a stock’s future performance.Here are seven large-cap stocks to buy and hold that get strong ratings from the Portfolio Grader.ELVElevance Health$495.32WMTWalmart$150.23AAPLApple$151.29RTXRaytheon Technologies$95.36QCOMQualcomm$123.85MELIMercadoLibre$962.08JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$176.20Elevance Health (ELV)A health insurance claim form with a stethoscope, a calculator, and several hundred dollar bills resting on top.Source: Valeri Potapova / Shutterstock.comFormerly known as Anthem, Elevance Health (NYSE:ELV) is the largest for-profit company providing health insurance under the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand. All and all, it’s one of the top-rated large-cap stocks to make a long-term holding.Although it’s still moving higher, as the market pulls back, ELV stock trades at a favorable valuation (15x forward earnings). It can easily sustain this earnings multiple, as it’s expected to continue growing its earnings per share by around 12.8% next year, and by about 13.6% in 2024.Elevance could continue to climb, in tandem with increased EPS. Its current forward yield of 1.05% may seem tiny, yet in time, it could grow to become mighty. Its low payout ratio (15.7%) leaves ample room for dividend growth.Story continuesThis stock earns an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.Walmart (WMT)A photo of the Walmart (WMT) logo on the side of a truck.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comWith about 10,500 stores and clubs around the world, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is one of the biggest retailers on the planet.

Walmart’s biggest competitor in the e-commerce space, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is down 33% on the year.After a rough first quarter in which Walmart both failed to meet expectations and lowered its full-year guidance, Walmart is enjoying a bit of a resurgence.

RSG is benefiting from its solid operating performance and investor-favorite steps.RSG’s earnings and revenues for 2022 are expected to improve 16% and 19% respectively, from the corresponding year-ago reported figures. Factors That Augur WellRepublic Services is focused on increasing its operational excellence by shifting to compressed natural gas (CNG) collection vehicles and converting rear-loading trucks to automated-side loaders. This, in turn, will reduce cost and improve profitability of RSG.RSG is focusing on enhancing its operations by streamlining the cost structure, improving the revenue quality and seeking growth through profitable investment opportunities. In 2021, almost 13% of the replacement vehicle purchases were CNG vehicles. Republic Services is highly optimistic about the usage of CNG vehicles, which will help it compete effectively on the grounds of maintaining a clean environment. As of Dec 31, 2021, Republic Services operated 40 CNG fuelling stations.We are also impressed with Republic Services’ consistent efforts in rewarding its shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, RSG paid $552.6 million, $522.5 million and $491.2 million in dividends and repurchased shares worth $252.2 million, $98.8 million and $399.4 million, respectively. Such moves indicate a company’s commitment to creating value for its shareholders and underline its confidence in its business. These initiatives buoy investors’ optimism on the stock and positively impact earnings per share.A Key RiskRepublic Services' liquidity position is concerning. RSG’s current ratio (a measure of liquidity) at the end of third-quarter 2022 was 0.70, lower than its prior quarter's figure of 0.73. Decreasing current ratio is not a favorable development. Moreover, a current ratio of less than 1 is not desirable as it implies a company's insufficiency of liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities.Story continuesZacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderRepublic Services currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Merck's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Merck How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Merck is:34% = US$15b ÷ US$45b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.34 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Merck's Earnings Growth And 34% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Merck has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 19% which is quite remarkable. As a result, Merck's exceptional 28% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.As a next step, we compared Merck's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 14%.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is MRK fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Merck Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Merck has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 64%, meaning the company only retains 36% of its income. This implies that the company has been able to achieve high earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.Additionally, Merck has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 37% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the lower expected payout ratio.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Merck's performance. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

The drug is targeted toward first-line treatment of HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. The study achieved its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS).Data from the study showed that the combination of Keytruda and chemotherapy exhibited a statistical and clinical improvement in OS in study participants, regardless of PD-L1 expression, compared with those treated with chemotherapy alone. Patients who were administered Keytruda plus chemotherapy also showed meaningful improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR).Keytruda, combined with Roche’s Herceptin (trastuzumab) and chemotherapy, was approved by the FDA last year under the accelerated pathway for first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma. This accelerated approval was based on data from the phase III KEYNOTE-811 study, wherein treatment with this combination achieved a statistically significant ORR of 74%.Merck’s shares have risen 39.5% this year compared with the industry’s 6.7% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPer management, advanced gastric cancer has one of the lowest five-year survival rates.

Merck is also evaluating Keytruda in an extensive clinical development program in gastrointestinal cancers, including a first-line advanced HER-2 positive gastric cancer and early-stage gastric cancer studyOther than gastric cancer, Keytruda is approved for the treatment of many cancers globally. Keytruda sales are gaining from continued strong momentum in metastatic indications, including in some types of NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, TNBC and MSI-H cancers. Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. In the first nine months of 2022, Merck generated $15.5 billion from Keytruda sales.Story continuesKeytruda faces stiff competition from Bristol Myers’ BMY Opdivo, which is also approved for many cancer indications. Combined with chemotherapy, Bristol Myers’ Opdivo is also approved by the FDA under the accelerated pathway for treating patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, GEJ cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma.Opdivo is one of the many blockbuster drugs marketed by Bristol Myers.

Throughout the year, the inflation rate has stayed at a 40-year high due to the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system, which has been complicated further by the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict. Demand has remained rock solid owing to the unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus given in the last two pandemic-ridden years.Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 7.3%, 17.1% and 29.5%, respectively.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Rockwell Automation is:30% = US$919m ÷ US$3.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.30 in profit.Does Rockwell Automation Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Rockwell Automation has a higher ROE than the average (14%) in the Electrical industry.roeThat's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Rockwell Automation.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesRockwell Automation's Debt And Its 30% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Rockwell Automation, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.27. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

(NYSE:GMED) in its Q4 2020 investor letter:“Healthcare continued its streak of underperformance in the fourth quarter. The biotech industry component of the Russell 2000 was up 34% for the quarter and 53% for the year. While we have become more open to investing in this space where appropriate, we prefer molecular diagnostics given less regulatory risk and better revenue diversification. With the new administration comes a shift in healthcare philosophy. We believe that further access to care and coverage expansion will benefit some parts of the sector. However, the risk of further reimbursement cuts, particularly in pharmaceuticals, will bear monitoring.Our favorite healthcare stock for 2021 is Globus Medical, a provider of spine implants and robotic solutions in the orthopedic industry. This stock has been a disappointing investment in the three years that we have held it. Though, the company itself has executed extremely well. We think this name is a “coiled spring” in a reopening scenario as management played aggressive offense in 2020. They aggressively have grown their sales force and did not hunker down during the pandemic. Recent quarters suggest that the company has taken considerable share, and this should bear fruit as surgical volumes resume in 2021 and 2022.”6. Omnicell, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ISRG), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), and Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK), Omnicell, Inc. (NASDAQ:OMCL) is one of the favorite stock picks of elite investors.  Here is what Carillon Scout Small Cap Fund has to say about Omnicell, Inc.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Boeing What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.60bUS$8.25bUS$9.24bUS$9.45bUS$9.65bUS$9.85bUS$10.0bUS$10.3bUS$10.5bUS$10.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x4Est @ 2.08%Est @ 2.05%Est @ 2.03%Est @ 2.01%Est @ 2%Est @ 2% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% US$4.3kUS$7.2kUS$7.5kUS$7.1kUS$6.8kUS$6.4kUS$6.1kUS$5.8kUS$5.5kUS$5.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$62bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.0%) = US$202bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$202b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$100bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$161b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$175, the company appears quite good value at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Boeing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.047. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Boeing, we've compiled three pertinent aspects you should further examine:Risks: To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Boeing .Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for BA's future outlook?

But at least the stock is up over the last five years. However we are not very impressed because the share price is only up 30%, less than the market return of 63%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Southern While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Southern managed to grow its earnings per share at 42% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 5% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Southern has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Southern will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Southern the TSR over the last 5 years was 62%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Southern shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 9.3% over the last year. That's including the dividend. However, that falls short of the 10% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   4 warning signs for Southern (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable)  that you should be aware of.Of course Southern may not be the best stock to buy.

Even though stock prices were relatively low, insiders elected to sell US$1.2m worth of stock in the last year, which could indicate some expected downturn.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, David Perry, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$394 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$522, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 25% of David Perry's holding. David Perry was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider Ownership Of Northrop GrummanLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Northrop Grumman insiders own about US$146m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Northrop Grumman Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Northrop Grumman shares in the last quarter. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Northrop Grumman, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To assist with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Northrop Grumman.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(BOOT)—a specialty retailer offering increasingly popular Western and work-related apparel, footwear and accessories. Boots are somewhat resistant to online competition because they often require specialized fitting. The company has benefited from its economies of scale and multi-channel business model, which have kept revenues flowing during virus-related shutdowns. Stimulus payments by the federal government to consumers have helped as well. Boot Barn’s private-label brands, built around well-known personalities in the music business, have enabled the company to convert higher portions of its revenues into bottom-line profits. For most of the period since March 2020, Boot Barn’s stock rallied on these positive conditions—and this rally continued in the fourth quarter. We consider Boot Barn’s management to be excellent, and we’ve continually added to our position on periodic price weakness within the context of an overall upward trajectory in the stock.”6.

However, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made in late October, Wells Fargo said it’s in “resolution discussions” with the CFPB on investigations regarding automobile lending, consumer deposits and mortgage lending.Wells Fargo and the CFPBThis is hardly the start of Wells Fargo’s run-ins with the CFPB and other federal regulators. The bank’s fake accounts scandal — in which Wells Fargo admitted in 2016 to creating millions of fraudulent accounts for customers without their consent — was followed by a string of CFPB reprimands and other federal actions.According to the most recent Bloomberg account, the CFPB is pressuring Wells Fargo to pay more than $1 billion to settle several investigations into the bank’s “mistreatment of customers.” The report said an accord between the bureau and Wells Fargo “isn’t imminent.”Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, is the nation’s third-largest bank based on domestic assets, $1.69 trillion as of September 2022, according to the Federal Reserve.In its third-quarter earnings, filed with the SEC in October, the bank reported $2 billion in operating losses due to “litigation, customer remediation, and regulatory matters primarily related to a variety of historical matters” in the quarter, Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf said on the company’s earnings call.Those losses amounted to a 31% dip in quarterly net income year over year. In the third quarter, Wells Fargo reported $3.5 billion in net income, according to a filing with the SEC. That’s down from its net income of $5.1 billion in the third quarter of 2021, according to public filings.Story continuesScharf, who became CEO in 2019, has been trying to put the bank’s regulatory woes in the rearview mirror. “We have much more work to do to satisfy our regulatory requirements, and we will likely have setbacks, but I’m confident in our ability to continue to close the remaining gaps over the next several years,” he said during the company’s first-quarter earnings call in April 2022.The current action could affect even those who don’t bank with Wells Fargo, observers say. When action is taken against a bank of that size, it has ripple effects throughout the consumer finance industry, says Jim Hawkins, professor of law at the University of Houston Law Center.“Every time the CFPB takes actions against the bank, all the other banks are watching to see what happens,” Hawkins says. “So it's always a cost-benefit analysis for these banks, right? They're trying to see how likely it is they're going to get penalized and how much the penalty is going to be. … When they see a billion-dollar fine, they think, or their lawyers think, ‘Hey, we better keep track of what's going on so that we don't get this kind of fine as well.’”What is the CFPB?The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was launched in 2011 as an independent agency within the Federal Reserve. Its goal: to supervise consumer financial institutions and enforce laws and regulations. Under the Obama administration, Congress created the CFPB as a response to the largely unchecked mortgage industry that led to the Great Recession in 2007 and 2008.Previously, several agencies were tasked with monitoring and enforcing laws in the consumer financial marketplace. Creating the CFPB centralized those efforts. Its founding meant banks and financial institutions had a more dedicated watchdog keeping an eye on them, Hawkins says.“Before the CFPB, all the federal regulators were focused on safety and soundness of the bank. Their primary job wasn't consumer protection. The CFPB is unique because its singular focus is protecting consumers, whereas the FDIC [Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.] and the Federal Reserve are all trying to make sure that banks don't go bust,” Hawkins says.If you have an issue with your bank, here’s how to file a complaint with the CFPB.Fines and legal actions: Wells Fargo’s recent historyWells Fargo’s entanglements with the CFPB began in September 2016, when the bank admitted that employees had created about 2.1 million fake accounts for existing customers without their consent between 2011 and 2015 to meet sky-high sales goals. Wells Fargo paid $185 million in fines and penalties in 2016.Since then, the bank has admitted to or been caught engaging in more fraudulent or unethical activity.March 2017: The bank reaches a $110 million settlement to compensate affected customers in its fake accounts scandal.August 2017: Wells Fargo clarifies that it created as many as 3.5 million fraudulent bank accounts between 2009 and 2016.February 2018: The Federal Reserve takes unprecedented action against Wells Fargo by setting an asset cap for the institution at $1.95 trillion in assets until it “sufficiently improves its governance and controls,” the Fed said in a statement. It was the first time the Fed imposed a cap on the entire assets of a financial institution. The Fed also forced the bank to remove three board members. As of Nov. 16, 2022, the bank was still under its asset cap.April 2018: Wells Fargo is fined more than $1 billion for unethical conduct in its mortgage and auto loans businesses. The CFPB found that the bank overcharged consumers on mortgage interest rates and unfairly added insurance policies that tacked on additional costs to borrowers’ auto loans.August 2018: Wells Fargo pays a $2.1 billion penalty for its role in the 2008 housing crisis. The Justice Department found that the bank lied to investors about the creditworthiness of the mortgage loans it sold them.February 2020: The Justice Department and the SEC fine Wells Fargo $3 billion for its fake accounts scandal.September 2021: Wells Fargo pays $72.6 million to settle Justice Department lawsuits after the agency found the bank overcharged hundreds of currency exchange customers. The bank would give customers “false explanations” about the erroneous fees it added to the cost to swap currencies.In addition, a Bloomberg report in March 2022 found that Wells Fargo was the only major lender to reject more Black mortgage refinancing applications than it approved in the mortgage refinancing boom of 2020.More From NerdWallet4 Ways Savings Vaults Can Help You Manage Holiday SpendingWant 4% on Your Savings? 5 Key Numbers to Know About CDsShould I Shop for Savings Accounts That Earn 3% APY?Cara Smith writes for NerdWallet.

The COVAX facility is a joint program between GAVI, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) for the equitable distribution of COVID vaccines in poorer countries.Though the termination of APA has not resulted in any penalties from Novavax’s side, management has stated that GAVI has no right to recover any advance payment made by it to the company under the APA.Novavax claims that it has received a non-refundable advance payment of $350 million from GAVI in 2021 and another non-refundable advance of $350 million earlier this year after WHO granted emergency use listing (EUL) to the company’s protein-based COVID vaccine.Per a Reuters’ article, GAVI rejected Novavax’s claim stating that Novavax was unable to make delivery of a single dose of the protein-based COVID vaccine to COVAX. The company also stated that it would recover the advanced payments made to Novavax made under the APA. A legal battle is most likely to ensue between Novavax and GAVI as both contradict each other’s claims.Shares of Novavax were down 10.7% on Nov 22 following this news. In fact, the stock has slumped 88.2% so far this year compared with the industry’s 19.9% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith the pandemic approaching the endemic phase, Novavax has been facing several headwinds with product demand. The company already slashed its revenue guidance for the full year 2022 twice. This has resulted in a fall from total revenue projections to around $2 billion from the earlier projections in the range of $4-$5 billion.Story continuesCurrently, Novavax’s COVID vaccine is approved for use in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older as a primary two-dose regimen. Last month, it was also authorized for use as a booster dose in adults aged 18 years and older.Although only a handful of vaccines have been approved /authorized in the United States, Novavax’s COVID vaccine sales severely lag when compared to product sales generated by Moderna MRNA and Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX. from their COVID vaccine product sales.The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have received full approval for use in adults in the United States. While Moderna’s vaccine is approved for adults aged 18 years and older, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is approved for use in individuals aged 12 years and older. Both these vaccines are also authorized for use in individuals aged six months and above in the United States.With regard to booster doses, Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech have also secured authorization from the FDA for using their respective Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccines in individuals as young as five years of age and older.Novavax, Inc.

(PFE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-inc-pfe-attracting-investor-140002935.html,1669212002,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned +7.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Pfizer falls in, has gained 9.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $1.09 per share, indicating a change of +0.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -15.5% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.46 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +46.2%. This estimate has changed +1.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.85 indicates a change of -25% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -8.2%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Pfizer.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PFE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate of $24.14 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $100.18 billion and $76.99 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +22.9% and -23.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $22.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6%. EPS of $1.78 for the same period compares with $1.34 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.61%. The EPS surprise was +21.09%.Over the last four quarters, Pfizer surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Data Mining Companies in the World. Data mining is one of the most important industries today, particularly when it comes to corporate functioning. Modern day businesses generate unfathomable amounts of data daily, and this information is useless unless the right set of tools is used to generate and deliver insights.The process, called data mining, is crucial to the operation of both large and small businesses. Its importance is clear when we take a look at market value and growth estimates. This market rivals the value of established and dominating industries such as crude oil, with a research report from Fortune Business Insights outlining that the process mining software market will be worth $933 million by the end of this year, and despite this sizeable value, it will nevertheless grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 49.5% to sit at a whopping $15,546.4 million by 2029. Process mining is similar to data mining, and it involves using tools to specifically map out business processes and generate insights for improvement. The growth and scope of the industry are understood better when statistics are taken into account.As Fortune Business Insights states, according to Accenture, 88% of businesses that used machine learning saw a 200% improvement in their operations. Machine learning is an advanced form of data mining that leverages large data sets to decipher patterns. These are then used to predict future outcomes, such as banking fraud or equipment downtimes and failures. According to the research firm, Europe will dominate the sector in terms of market value, while North America will be the fastest growing. These conclusions are in stark contrast with estimates for other segments that have often pegged Asia Pacific as the fastest growing region for a variety of industries such as consumer technology.Story continuesThis article casts a wide net and it looks at a host of data mining companies, such as those which provide the software and those that power the software with the hardware along with others that utilize data mining for their daily operations. Some data mining names likely to catch your eye include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc.

IBM Has the Resources To Help.,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/private-sector-position-sustainable-future-151500927.html,1669216500,STORY,['IBM'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / November 23, 2022 / IBM:With climate emergencies and disasters on the rise across the globe, private sector companies - particularly large companies with global reach - are in a unique position to make a difference in our collective fight to help build a more sustainable and equitable future.According to the World Bank, climate-related disasters and natural hazards push 26 million people into poverty each year. The world's poorest populations face economic devastation after these events, which have long-term impacts on health, education, and more.It's clear that there's a need for technical and institutional support for economically under-prioritized populations when it comes to bolstering our resilience in responding to climate change. As a tech company dedicated to using innovative technologies to address environmental challenges, IBM is working to provide this support to local and regional organizations across the globe. The model that IBM is developing helps invest in equitable and long-term solutions to environmental injustice.Powerful partnershipsThere are on-the-ground, local organizations all over the world that are doing the challenging, important day-to-day work of helping their communities find solutions to combat climate change and increase climate emergency resiliency. They are rich in ideas and local networks but often need support to increase capacity, scale their projects, and boost their reach.IBM has consistently tackled the most pressing challenges of the day by building technologies to help operationalize sustainability - including solutions designed to support developing economies transitioning to a clean energy future. That's why IBM is now working to give these local and regional organizations support from engineers, technology, and climate experts to help scale these projects and reach their environmental goals.Through the Sustainability Accelerator program launched in February 2022, IBM selected five organizations to receive end-to-end support for projects focused on sustainable agriculture, beginning with the ideation stage and a technical roadmap to scale long-term impacts and drive key societal outcomes. This collaborative approach means groups already working on the ground in key countries and regions of the world are getting the support they need to help vulnerable populations combat environmental threats like climate change.Story continuesNow, IBM will be expanding its efforts in 2023.Clean energyFor the second cohort of the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, the five organizations selected to receive technology and support will be the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Sustainable Energy for All, the Miyakojima City Government, the Environment Without Borders Foundation, and Net Zero Atlantic. These organizations will focus on clean energy projects.Each organization was chosen because of its existing engagement with vulnerable communities, its ability to increase access to affordable clean energy services, and its strategic focus and transparency on measurement and reporting.From utilizing AI and geospatial analytics expertise to leveraging modeling and engagement capabilities, these projects will use IBM technology and expertise to help people in Africa, India, Japan, Canada, and Egypt.Turning sustainability ambition into actionProviding these organizations with innovative tech solutions along with the expertise needed to help scale their projects will play a crucial role in turning sustainability ambition into action. This is a model that all companies - and particularly those that have tech solutions and vast resources - should consider employing.To help confront climate change, we will need an all-hands-on-deck approach that leverages technology and private sector funding, among a range of other tools, and work with local and regional organizations to make it happen. Companies across the world have a societal imperative to step up.It will take work, but together, we can drive meaningful solutions designed to help us tackle today's most pressing climate issues through efforts centered on sustainability, resiliency, and equitability.This post was created by IBM with Insider Studios.IBM, Wednesday, November 23, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IBMWebsite: profiles/ibmEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IBMView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/728102/The-Private-Sector-Is-in-a-Position-To-Make-a-Sustainable-Future-Possible-IBM-Has-the-Resources-To-Help]"

Per the terms of the deal, COP will handle the natural gas supply requirements for Phase 1 of the proposed liquefaction facility.Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 will involve two liquefaction trains, LNG storage tanks and associated facilities. The project is expected to produce up to 13.5 million tons per annum of LNG, with the Phase 2 project currently under development.Sempra Energy is advancing the global energy transition through electrification and decarbonization in the markets it serves, including California, Texas, Mexico and the LNG export market. The company will likely make a final investment decision for the project’s first phase in early 2023.Last month, Sempra Energy finalized an engineering, procurement and construction contract with Bechtel Energy for Phase 1. Per the contract, Bechtel will execute the detailed engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, start-up, performance testing and operator training activities.Oil and gas producers aim to drive domestic LNG supply and exports as western sanctions on Russia have hindered an already undersupplied market and put U.S. gas prices into a higher gear. ConocoPhillips’ participation in the Port Arthur project will provide a reliable supply of natural gas and enhance its portfolio.Price PerformanceShares of COP have outperformed the industry in the past six months.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, McKesson Corp. MCK, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM and Merck &amp; Co. Inc. MRK.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Buy These 5 Corporate Giants Flying High in a Disappointing 2022Less than six weeks of trading are left to complete 2022, which has been rather disappointing. Throughout the year, the inflation rate has stayed at a 40-year high due to the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system, which has been complicated further by the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict. Demand has remained rock solid owing to the unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus given in the last two pandemic-ridden years.Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 7.3%, 17.1% and 29.5%, respectively. Despite these headwinds, several corporate bigwigs have flourished this year with more upside left. Five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., McKesson Corp., Marathon Petroleum Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Merck &amp; Co. Inc.Peak Inflation Seems Behind UsOn Nov 10, the Department of Labor reported that the consumer price index (CPI) in October rose 0.4% month over month and 7.7% year over year. The consensus estimate was for a month-over-month rise of 0.5% and a year-over-year gain of 7.9%Core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) increased 0.3% month over month and 6.3% year over year. The consensus estimate was for a rise of 0.5% month over month and 6.5% year over year.On Nov 15, the Department of Labor reported that the producer price index (PPI) increased 0.2% in October compared with the consensus estimate of a 0.5% rise. September's data was revised downward from 0.4% to 0.2%.Story continuesYear over year, PPI rose 8%, dropping from the 8.4% rise in September. Core PPI increased 0.2% in October compared with the consensus estimate of 0.4%. Year over year, core PPI rose 5.4% in October.In third-quarter 2022, the chain-weighted price index — a cost-of-living index adjusted for consumer behavior — rose 4.1%, well below the consensus estimate of a 5.3% gain. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased 4.2%, exhibiting a sharp fall from 7.3% in the second quarter. The core PCE price index — Fed's favorite inflation gauge — rose 4.5% in the third quarter, in line with market expectations.As peak inflation seems behind us, the Fed is likely to relax its tighter monetary control. The central bank is expected to reduce the magnitude of the interest rate hike from the December FOMC meeting. This will help the overall equity market.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital &gt; $50 billion) that have popped year to date. These stocks have solid growth potential for the rest of 2022 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Archer-Daniels-Midland has been gaining from solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations. Persistent growth in the Nutrition segment of ADM, aided by significant gains in the Human and Animal Nutrition units, remains the key growth driver.Archer-Daniels-Midland expects the nutrition segment to record operating profit growth of 20% in 2022. The company has been significantly progressing on its three strategic pillars — optimize, drive and growth.Zacks Rank #1 Archer-Daniels-Midland has an expected earnings growth rate of 42.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 7.4% over the last 30 days. The stock price of ADM has surged 42.2% year to date.Marathon Petroleum is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC's $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC's exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.Zacks Rank #1 Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.3 % over the last seven days. The stock price of MPC has soared 88% year to date.McKesson provides pharmaceuticals and medical supplies in the United States and internationally. The strong fiscal first-quarter show by three of the four segments of MCK is encouraging. A strong earnings outlook for fiscal 2023 instill optimism.Strong adjusted operating profit growth across the key segments of MCK is encouraging. A strong position in the Distribution market continues to favor the stock. McKesson played a crucial role in the COVID-19 response efforts in the United States and abroad via the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, ancillary supply kits, and COVID-19 tests.Zacks Rank #2 McKesson has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.5% for the current year (ending March 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. The stock price of MCK has climbed 48.3% year to date.Exxon Mobil's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure, which have historically led to industry-leading returns, make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. The integrated oil giant expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in its upstream business.At the same time, XOM expects to reduce flaring and methane emissions by 40%. With the reopening of the global economy, crude oil prices are likely to remain high despite near-term growth concerns.Zacks Rank #2 Exxon Mobil has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.2% over the last 30 days. The stock price of XOM has jumped 81.3% year to date.Merck has been benefiting from strong sales of  Keytruda, Lynparza and Bridion. With continued label expansion into new indications and early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver of MRK.Animal health and vaccine products are the core growth drivers. Merck's new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, should be a key top-line driver in 2022. MRK boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth.Zacks Rank #2 Merck has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1% over the last 30 days. The stock price of MRK has advanced 37.8% year to date.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The Detroit Three automakers all have battery plants in the works with Korean partners.South Korea and the Biden administration have sparred over a U.S. decision to revise a tax credit making all EVs assembled outside North America ineligible for tax credits, including all Hyundai and Kia EVs for sale.GM and LG Energy are considering an Indiana site for a fourth U.S. battery plant.

141,f23a4e25-bb21-3722-95b4-2e1edde8ebcb,UAL,2022-11-24,Why U.S. Airlines May Fly High This Thanksgiving Travel Period,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-u-airlines-may-fly-203008750.html,1669235408,STORY,"['DAL', 'UAL', 'AAL']","[Moving over the worst phase of the pandemic gloom, airlines recovered gradually, with passenger revenues rebounding from rock bottom. Air-travel demand made a stronger-than-expected recovery as people are again booking flights, thereby boosting passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of most airlines’ top lines.Following the removal of coronavirus-induced restrictions, pent-up demand is driving traffic for the airlines. Despite inflationary pressures and the resultant high-interest rates, there is a wave of optimism in the United States surrounding air-travel demand. Given this rosy backdrop, U.S. airlines like Delta Air Lines DAL, United Airlines UAL and American Airlines AAL are likely to have a very hectic schedule this Thanksgiving week. All the above-mentioned airlines currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.To meet the anticipated demand swell, U.S. airlines are boosting capacity despite the labor crunch that has gripped them. The labor crisis apart, fuel costs remain elevated inducing high air fares. However, these headwinds are unlikely to have a significant adverse impact on the passenger volumes in the Thanksgiving period, as people are very eager to travel after being confined to their homes during the pandemic.Per the American Automobile Association (AAA), air-travel during the Thanksgiving holiday period this year is likely to be 8% more than the 2021 actuals. Passenger volume by air this year (4.51 million) is likely to be 99% of the 2019 levels (pre-coronavirus era). Moreover, the prevalence of remote working is currently expected to ease the congestion with respect to air-travel this year as remote working helps many people travel on days where the rush is likely to be relatively less and air-tickets comparatively cheaper.Upbeat Projections From AirlinesUnited Airlines expects to make the most of buoyant air-travel demand this Thanksgiving spell. Anticipating high passenger volume, UAL expects to transport 12% more passengers from the 2021 levels during the Thanksgiving travel period.Story continuesUnited Airlines reportedly anticipates transporting 5.5 million passengers during the Thanksgiving sojourn. The projected passenger volume is roughly the same as the 2019 actuals (pre-coronavirus era). To meet this expected spike in demand, UAL intends to operate 3,700 plus flights (on average) daily during the Nov 18-Nov 30 time frame. Management believes that passenger volume will touch the maximum on Nov 27 (the Sunday after Thanksgiving) since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 460,000 passengers are expected to travel on UAL flights that day. United Airlines will operate roughly 275 extra flights on the said date to meet the anticipated demand upsurge.American Airlines also expects Nov 27 to be the busiest travel day. Management expects 6.8 million passengers to be transported on AAL flights during the Thanksgiving vacation (Nov 17-Nov 27). To meet this demand revival, AAL intends to operate more than 66,000 scheduled flights across its network. On Nov 27, around 5,500 scheduled flights will be operated by AAL.Delta expects to attract nearly 6 million passengers to its flights over the Nov 18-Nov 29 period. This translates into nearly 500,000 passengers, on average, per day. DAL’s projection this year is a tad less than the 6.3 million passengers, who availed the airline’s flights during the Thanksgiving trips in 2019.Expressing delight at the likely high passenger volumes this year over the Thanksgiving holiday period, Delta’s CEO Ed Bastian said, “The holidays are all about connecting with loved ones, and after two years of disruption and unknowns, those connections are more important than ever.” Thanks to the hard work of our more than 80,000 people around the globe, Delta customers can expect the very best service and industry-leading reliability as they reconnect this holiday season. Our teams are ready to serve.""Wrapping UpThe above write-up clearly suggests that passenger volumes will be high over the Thanksgiving outing this year. High passenger traffic despite headwinds like labor shortage bodes well for the airlines. Steep air fares coupled with strong passenger volumes mean that the top lines of U.S. carriers will be significantly bolstered by the upbeat air-traffic expected over the Thanksgiving break. This should aid the aviation space immensely as it bounces back from a crippled stage, thanks to the deadly pandemic blows.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The biotech industry component of the Russell 2000 was up 34% for the quarter and 53% for the year. While we have become more open to investing in this space where appropriate, we prefer molecular diagnostics given less regulatory risk and better revenue diversification. With the new administration comes a shift in healthcare philosophy. We believe that further access to care and coverage expansion will benefit some parts of the sector. However, the risk of further reimbursement cuts, particularly in pharmaceuticals, will bear monitoring.Our favorite healthcare stock for 2021 is Globus Medical, a provider of spine implants and robotic solutions in the orthopedic industry. This stock has been a disappointing investment in the three years that we have held it. Though, the company itself has executed extremely well. We think this name is a “coiled spring” in a reopening scenario as management played aggressive offense in 2020. They aggressively have grown their sales force and did not hunker down during the pandemic. Recent quarters suggest that the company has taken considerable share, and this should bear fruit as surgical volumes resume in 2021 and 2022.”6. Omnicell, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ISRG), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), and Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK), Omnicell, Inc. (NASDAQ:OMCL) is one of the favorite stock picks of elite investors.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So when we looked at CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on CSX is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$5.8b ÷ (US$42b - US$2.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, CSX has an ROCE of 15%.  By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 15%. See our latest analysis for CSX roceIn the above chart we have measured CSX's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering CSX here  for free.The Trend Of ROCECSX's ROCE growth is quite impressive. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 31% over the last five years. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.In Conclusion...To bring it all together, CSX has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. And with a respectable 88% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesLike most companies, CSX does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.While CSX may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications Verizon Communications Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the , Tamara Erwin, for US$1.2m worth of shares, at about US$49.77 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$38.92. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it. Tamara Erwin was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does Verizon Communications Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Verizon Communications insiders own about US$29m worth of shares. That equates to 0.02% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Verizon Communications Insiders?The fact that there have been no Verizon Communications insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by Verizon Communications insiders. But it's good to see that insiders own shares in the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To assist with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Verizon Communications.Story continuesBut note: Verizon Communications may not be the best stock to buy.

(NYSE:BOOT) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“The top contributor to Fund performance for the fourth quarter was Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. (BOOT)—a specialty retailer offering increasingly popular Western and work-related apparel, footwear and accessories. Boots are somewhat resistant to online competition because they often require specialized fitting. The company has benefited from its economies of scale and multi-channel business model, which have kept revenues flowing during virus-related shutdowns. Stimulus payments by the federal government to consumers have helped as well. Boot Barn’s private-label brands, built around well-known personalities in the music business, have enabled the company to convert higher portions of its revenues into bottom-line profits. For most of the period since March 2020, Boot Barn’s stock rallied on these positive conditions—and this rally continued in the fourth quarter. We consider Boot Barn’s management to be excellent, and we’ve continually added to our position on periodic price weakness within the context of an overall upward trajectory in the stock.”6.

(NYSE:TJX), Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), and NIKE, Inc.

(NYSE:TPR) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Luxury accessory and lifestyle brand, Tapestry, Inc. was the top contributor to performance over the trailing one-year period. Revenue improvement across all three brands with a notable increase in consumer demand, particularly for the Coach business, triple-digit growth in e-commerce, and better than expected pricing, drove margins higher.

QGEN is well poised for growth in the coming quarters on the back of product launches. The optimism led by robust third-quarter 2022 performance and a few strategic collaborations in the past few months are expected to contribute further. Headwinds from its reliance on commercial relationships and a stiff competitive landscape persist.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 11.5% compared with a 23.1% decline of the industry and a 17.5% fall of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned molecular diagnostics solutions provider has a market capitalization of $10.99 billion. QIAGEN projects 15.1% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain strong segmental performance. The company surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 16.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Product Launches: We are upbeat about QIAGEN’s recent product launches. The company, this month, announced the launch of the monkeypox (MPXV) test for its NeuMoDx automated polymerase chain reaction platform — NeuMoDx MPXV Test Strip — to strengthen surveillance and research into the current outbreak in non-endemic regions.In September, QIAGEN announced new additions to its comprehensive NeuMoDx assay menu for organ transplant-associated viruses — the new assays for identifying and quantifying the Epstein-Barr virus and human herpesvirus 6. The assays have received CE-IVD certification for the European Union and other countries that accept this marking.Strategic Tie-Ups: We are optimistic about the collaborations entered into by QIAGEN in the past few months. In September, the company inked an agreement with Neuron23 Inc. to develop a companion diagnostic for Neuron23’s brain penetrant leucine-rich repeat kinase inhibitor for Parkinson’s disease.During first-quarter 2022 earnings call in April, QIAGEN confirmed entering into a collaboration with Element Biosciences Partners to validate its Universal NGS library prep and target enrichment portfolio on the Element AVITI system.Story continuesStrong Q3 Results: QIAGEN’s robust results in the third quarter of 2022 instill optimism. The company registered solid growth in its non-COVID-19 portfolio and sales from the Americas during the quarter. Expansion of the adjusted gross margin bodes well. QIAGEN continued seeing broad-based demand for its solutions in molecular research and clinical testing markets globally.DownsidesReliance on Commercial Relationships: QIAGEN’s future level of sales for companion diagnostics depends heavily on the commercial success of the related medicines for which the tests have been designed to determine their use in patients. However, the company may be unable to maintain the relationships with its collaborative partners, who may pursue or develop competing products or technologies, either on their own or in collaboration with others.Stiff Competition: QIAGEN is facing intensifying competition from firms providing pre-analytical solutions and other products used by QIAGEN’s customers. The markets for some of the company’s products are very competitive and price sensitive as well.Estimate TrendQIAGEN has been witnessing an upward estimate revision trend for 2022. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 4.1% north to $2.30.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $482.6 million, suggesting a 17.1% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

However, stiff competition remains a concern.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have gained 6.3% against the industry’s decline of 29.2% on a year-to-date basis. The S&amp;P 500 Index has fallen 18.3% in the same time frame.Glaukos — with a market capitalization of $2.25 billion — is a leading ophthalmic medical technology and pharmaceutical company. It projects earnings growth of 16.3% for 2023 and expects to sustain its strong performance. The company has a trailing negative four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.6%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKey CatalystsClinical trials are the primary means to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new medical technologies.Glaukos launched iPrime — a new disco elastic delivery device — in the latter part of the second quarter. In the latter part of the first quarter, the company had launched the iAccess device for go anatomy procedures. The addition of these new devices will provide unique solutions designed to grow and improve treatment options for surgeons, customers and patients. The company’s iAccess device received positive market feedback.In August, Glaukos received clearance from the FDA for the commercialization of iStent infinite as an implantable device intended to reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) of the eye in adult patients with primary open-angle glaucoma in whom previous medical and surgical treatment failed. The company plans to launch the product during the fourth quarter.In September, Glaukos announced that its targeted injectable implant candidate — iDose TR — for glaucoma patients achieved excellent tolerability and a favorable safety profile, per top-line data from two pivotal studies. The candidate achieved non-inferior reductions in IOP in three months from baseline compared to the timolol ophthalmic solution. Based on these data, the company is planning to file a new drug application (NDA), seeking approval for iDose TR from the FDA by the end of 2023. A potential approval for the candidate will substantially boost revenues for Glaukos.Story continuesThe company is also developing three other candidates — GLK-301, GLK-302 and third-generation iLink therapy — in separate phase II studies as a potential treatment for Dry Eye Disease, presbyopia and keratoconus, respectively.These positive developments raise our optimism about the stock.Glaukos’s better-than-expected revenues and earnings in the third quarter were also encouraging.Factor Hurting the StockGlaukos’ competitors include medical companies, academic and research institutions, and others that develop new drugs, therapies, medical devices or surgical procedures to treat glaucoma. Thus, intense competition continues to weigh on the company’s overall performance.Estimates TrendFor 2023, the consensus mark for the bottom line is pegged at a loss of $1.84 per share, estimated to be 16.3% narrower than the anticipated loss of $2.20 per share in 2022.

162,0bd6b4ec-89dc-3e6f-bc58-9a2519377f54,MCK,2022-11-24,"Alcon (ALC) Q3 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Sales Guidance Cut",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alcon-alc-q3-earnings-surpass-152403180.html,1669217043,STORY,"['ALC.SW', 'AMN', 'MCK', 'SWAV']","[Alcon Inc. ALC delivered core earnings per share (EPS) of 50 cents for the third quarter of 2022. Earnings were down 7% from the year-ago quarter’s figure (up 14% at constant exchange rate or CER). The figure exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.2%. Alcon’s “core” results are based on non-IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) measures.ALC’s third-quarter reported EPS of 23 cents compared favorably with the year-ago quarter's break-even figure.Revenues in DetailAlcon’s net sales to third parties in the third quarter were $2.12 billion, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.7%. The top line increased 2% from the year-ago quarter’s levels (up 9% at CER).In the third quarter, Total Surgical (consisting of implantables, consumables and equipment/other) sales amounted to $1.21 billion, up 15% at CER. Alcon registered implantables growth, driven by the strength of its comprehensive portfolio of PCIOLs, including PanOptix and Vivity.Total Vision Care (comprising contact lenses and ocular health) reported sales of $908 million, up 5% year over year at CER. In the quarter, higher demand in both the U.S. and international markets was partially offset by adverse foreign exchange impact to the tune of 700 basis points.MarginsThe cost of net sales in the quarter was $958 million, up 7.4% year over year. Core gross profit fell 1.3% to $1.31 billion in the reported quarter. Core gross margin contracted 190 basis points (bps) to 61.2% in the third quarter of 2022.The core operating margin was 17.1% in the quarter, marking a year-over-year contraction of 60 bps at CER.Financial PositionAlcon exited third-quarter 2022, with cash and cash equivalents of $1.18 billion compared with $1.03 billion at the end of Q2.Cumulative net cash flow from operating activities at the end of the quarter was $872 million compared with $958 million a year ago. For the same period, free cash flow totaled $475 million compared with $578 million in the year-ago quarter.Story continues2022 ViewAlcon updated its 2022 guidance, assuming global markets grow at slightly above historical rates, inflation remains at current levels throughout the remainder of the year and the supply chain does not materially deteriorate. Also, the exchange rates as of mid-October 2022 are expected to prevail through year-end. The company has not considered the impact of its recently-completed acquisition of Aerie Pharmaceuticals.The company projects net sales in the range of $8.5-$8.7 billion (down from the earlier projection of $8.6-$8.8 billion), indicating growth of 10-11% at CER from the 2021 level (9-11% expected previously). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALC’s revenues is pegged at $8.74 billion.The company also reduced the upper end of its core earnings per share expectations to the range of $2.20-$2.25 ($2.20-$2.30 previously), suggesting growth of 21-24% from 2021 levels (19-24%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALC’s earnings is currently pegged at $2.26 per share.Our TakeAlcon exited the third quarter with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same. Despite the macroeconomic concerns, the company reported strong underlying third-quarter performance within its business. Its robust innovation pipeline is delivering solid results as evidenced by the strength in its comprehensive portfolio of PCIOLs, including PanOptix and Vivity.However, given the supply chain challenges, unfavorable foreign exchange impact, ongoing inflationary pressure and other macroeconomic headwinds, the company had to reduce its core net sales expectations and tighten its core earnings per share expectations for 2022.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksAlcon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, AMN Healthcare Services AMN and McKesson MCK, all carrying a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ShockWave Medical’s EPS is stable at $2.57 for 2022 and rose from $3.42 to $3.56 for 2023 in the past 60 days.

163,ff45fbcd-4525-3fda-9da5-6392aa9af28b,MCK,2022-11-24,Here's Why You Should Add McKesson (MCK) Stock Right Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-add-mckesson-mck-151503091.html,1669216503,STORY,['MCK'],"[McKessonCorporation MCK is well-poised for growth, backed by strategic collaborations and strength in the distribution solutions segment. However, the company’s opioid-related litigation expenses pose a threat.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have gained 51.9% so far this year against the industry’s decline of 15.9%. The S&amp;P 500 Index has fallen 18.4% in the same time frame.The company — with a market capitalization of $52.29 billion — is a health care services and information technology company. Its earnings are anticipated to improve 10.1% over the next five years. The company beat earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 4.79%. The company’s earnings yield of 6.7% also compares favorably with the industry’s 5.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring It?McKesson continues to actively pursue deals, divestitures and acquisitions to drive growth. In April 2022, the company completed the divestiture of its retail and distribution businesses in the United Kingdom to Aurelius. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, the company completed the sale of its Austrian business to Quadrifolia management and the sale of its remaining share of its German joint venture to Walgreens Boots Alliance. The company is currently progressing with the divestiture of its European business. These divestitures will allow the company to focus on its key growth market — the United States.In October, McKesson formed a joint venture with HCA Healthcare HCA to create a fully integrated oncology research organization. Per the deal, McKesson and HCA Healthcare will integrate their research units — US Oncology Research (USOR) and Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI). The newly created entity with the combined capabilities of SCRI and USOR is expected to boost clinical research, ramp up the development of drugs, lead to better data and analytics capabilities and pave the way for a wider portfolio of clinical trials.Story continuesMcKesson acquired privately-held prescription price transparency and benefit insight company, Rx Savings Solutions, for a total consideration of up to $875 million earlier this month. The total deal value includes an upfront payment of $600 million and up to $275 million in contingent consideration based on RxSS’ financial performance through the calendar year 2025.McKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market. The Distribution Solutions segment caters to a wide range of customers and businesses and stands to benefit from increased generic utilization, inflation in generics, courtesy of several patent expirations in the next few years and an aging population.During the fiscal second quarter of 2023, McKesson’s growth was led by its strong performance across all segments, except the International segment, which was marred by unfavorable currency movement and continued divesture of European businesses.The company removed a major overhang during the fiscal first quarter by settling or signing a settlement agreement related to the opioid-related claims of all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and all eligible territories. These developments will close long-pending litigations that have been hurting the company’s goodwill and will also reduce legal expenses.McKesson’s agreements with the U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting and storage programs and COVID-19 tests are an added benefit.What’s Hurting the Stock?McKesson’s broad settlement of opioid-related claims of states and municipalities is likely to drive expenses for the company in the short term. Moreover, price fluctuation of generic pharmaceuticals and stiff competition in the MedTech space are other headwinds.Estimates TrendFor fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $274.5 billion, indicating an improvement of 4% from the year-ago period’s reported figure. The same for adjusted earnings per share stands at $24.76, suggesting growth of 4.5% from the prior-year reported figure.McKesson Corporation PriceMcKesson Corporation PriceMcKesson Corporation price | McKesson Corporation QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderA couple of other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services AMNand Lantheus LNTH, all currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 2.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, McKesson Corp. MCK, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM and Merck &amp; Co. Inc. MRK.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Buy These 5 Corporate Giants Flying High in a Disappointing 2022Less than six weeks of trading are left to complete 2022, which has been rather disappointing. Throughout the year, the inflation rate has stayed at a 40-year high due to the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system, which has been complicated further by the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict. Demand has remained rock solid owing to the unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus given in the last two pandemic-ridden years.Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 7.3%, 17.1% and 29.5%, respectively. Despite these headwinds, several corporate bigwigs have flourished this year with more upside left. Five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., McKesson Corp., Marathon Petroleum Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Merck &amp; Co. Inc.Peak Inflation Seems Behind UsOn Nov 10, the Department of Labor reported that the consumer price index (CPI) in October rose 0.4% month over month and 7.7% year over year. The consensus estimate was for a month-over-month rise of 0.5% and a year-over-year gain of 7.9%Core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) increased 0.3% month over month and 6.3% year over year. The consensus estimate was for a rise of 0.5% month over month and 6.5% year over year.On Nov 15, the Department of Labor reported that the producer price index (PPI) increased 0.2% in October compared with the consensus estimate of a 0.5% rise. September's data was revised downward from 0.4% to 0.2%.Story continuesYear over year, PPI rose 8%, dropping from the 8.4% rise in September. Core PPI increased 0.2% in October compared with the consensus estimate of 0.4%. Year over year, core PPI rose 5.4% in October.In third-quarter 2022, the chain-weighted price index — a cost-of-living index adjusted for consumer behavior — rose 4.1%, well below the consensus estimate of a 5.3% gain. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased 4.2%, exhibiting a sharp fall from 7.3% in the second quarter. The core PCE price index — Fed's favorite inflation gauge — rose 4.5% in the third quarter, in line with market expectations.As peak inflation seems behind us, the Fed is likely to relax its tighter monetary control. The central bank is expected to reduce the magnitude of the interest rate hike from the December FOMC meeting. This will help the overall equity market.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital &gt; $50 billion) that have popped year to date. These stocks have solid growth potential for the rest of 2022 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Archer-Daniels-Midland has been gaining from solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations. Persistent growth in the Nutrition segment of ADM, aided by significant gains in the Human and Animal Nutrition units, remains the key growth driver.Archer-Daniels-Midland expects the nutrition segment to record operating profit growth of 20% in 2022. The company has been significantly progressing on its three strategic pillars — optimize, drive and growth.Zacks Rank #1 Archer-Daniels-Midland has an expected earnings growth rate of 42.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 7.4% over the last 30 days. The stock price of ADM has surged 42.2% year to date.Marathon Petroleum is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC's $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC's exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.Zacks Rank #1 Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.3 % over the last seven days. The stock price of MPC has soared 88% year to date.McKesson provides pharmaceuticals and medical supplies in the United States and internationally. The strong fiscal first-quarter show by three of the four segments of MCK is encouraging. A strong earnings outlook for fiscal 2023 instill optimism.Strong adjusted operating profit growth across the key segments of MCK is encouraging. A strong position in the Distribution market continues to favor the stock. McKesson played a crucial role in the COVID-19 response efforts in the United States and abroad via the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, ancillary supply kits, and COVID-19 tests.Zacks Rank #2 McKesson has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.5% for the current year (ending March 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. The stock price of MCK has climbed 48.3% year to date.Exxon Mobil's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure, which have historically led to industry-leading returns, make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. The integrated oil giant expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in its upstream business.At the same time, XOM expects to reduce flaring and methane emissions by 40%. With the reopening of the global economy, crude oil prices are likely to remain high despite near-term growth concerns.Zacks Rank #2 Exxon Mobil has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.2% over the last 30 days. The stock price of XOM has jumped 81.3% year to date.Merck has been benefiting from strong sales of  Keytruda, Lynparza and Bridion. With continued label expansion into new indications and early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver of MRK.Animal health and vaccine products are the core growth drivers. Merck's new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, should be a key top-line driver in 2022. MRK boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth.Zacks Rank #2 Merck has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1% over the last 30 days. The stock price of MRK has advanced 37.8% year to date.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

166,9b43f717-c91c-3617-81d4-b34eecb444e8,MCK,2022-11-24,5 Solid Dividend Growth Stocks for Thanksgiving,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-solid-dividend-growth-stocks-130301590.html,1669208581,STORY,"['DRI', '^GSPC', 'BAH', 'MCK', 'ADM']","[Thanksgiving is coming up, and it’s time to stuff dividend stocks with strong growth prospects in your portfolio for market-beating returns. This is especially true as the holiday-shortened week is usually a bullish feast for stock investors, even with low volumes, as consumer spending is expected to rise.Stocks with a history of dividend growth year over year form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ADM, McKesson Corporation MCK, ParkerHannifin Corporation PH, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation BAH and Darden Restaurants Inc. DRI  — that could be compelling picks for your portfolio this Thanksgiving.Inside Dividend Growth StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environments.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 18.Here are five of the 18 stocks that fit the bill:Illinois-based Archer-Daniels is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products. ADM has seen a solid earnings estimate revision of 51 cents for this year and an expected earnings growth rate of 42.58%.Archer-Daniels has a Zacks Rank #1 and Growth Score of A.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with DIS. Click here to check it out. DIS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DISPeter Lynch Chart of DISThe news of Iger's return has been met with praise and celebration from analysts and industry professionals alike. Several analysts from MoffettNathanson, Needham, Bank of America and Wells Fargo have even commented on how the balance of power is shifting, and they all agree that it benefits Disney and its shareholders.Iger previously served as the CEO of Disney from 2005 to 2020, during which time the company grew steadily. He facilitated several key mergers and acquisitions that resulted in the entertainment giant owning Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. He also spearheaded the creation of its streaming platform, Disney+.Now he is expected to set the company up with a strategy for renewed growth, while also finding and training a successor before he eventually decides to retire for good.All in all, the announcement has been really good for Disney and was just the thing it needed after months of seeing its stock fall.Disney gets the shot in the arm it needsThe company, which was founded by Walt Disney in 1923, has become one of the biggest names in the mass media and entertainment industries. With a diverse number of businesses, including streaming services, film production and even theme parks and cruise lines, it is one of the most recognized brands in the world.However, in recent months, Disney has been in a bind. The stock has taken a hit as investors grow increasingly pessimistic about the company's prospects.Story continuesTheir concerns are not unfounded, however.In the fourth quarter, Disney disclosed it added 12.1 million net subscribers. This included new subscribers for Hulu and ESPN+, bringing the total to 71.5 million users. Despite adding new subscribers, revenue per user of $3.91 was below analysts estimates of $4.24. Revenue of $20.5 billion also failed to meet expectations, while the operating income of $1.6 billion was 55% lower than the previous quarter. Additionally, theme park revenue of $7.42 billion, which represented a 36% year-over-year increase, did not beat Wall Street's forecasts.Meanwhile, the direct-to-consumer business is generating losses with its content spending spree. Disney lost $1.5 billion last quarter and is estimated to have lost a total of $4 billion in fiscal 2022.Trying to shake things upThe financial results compounded an already tricky situation for the entertainment giant. Over the last several months, activist investors have encircled the company, with some big names in the mix.Daniel Loeb (Trades, Portfolio) of Third Point, with a stake worth nearly $1 billion, recently stopped pushing the company to sell off ESPN to make a profit. However, he is still advocating for Disney to freshen up the board and find ways to cut costs.Another activist investor, Nelson Peltz (Trades, Portfolio) of Trian Fund Management, is asking Disney to improve its operations while reducing costs. Moreover, it was reported that the investor, who has a stake valued at more than $800 million, is unhappy with the decision to bring back Iger.Disney itself has been busy recently, announcing plans to increase prices for some of its Disney+ packages. While this decision may be unpopular with some customers, it is still one of the more affordable entertainment options available. Further, the streaming service will soon introduce an ad-supported subscription tier, allowing customers to save money on their accounts. While the company is not expecting a bump in revenue until later in the year, this is still good news as it will eventually see an increase from its Disney+ subscribers.The company also recently raised prices at its Walt Disney World park in Orlando, but this price hike is still absorbable considering its brand value.TakeawayDisney is a large and diversified company with a long history of success. While the current situation may be challenging, there is no reason to believe the company will not eventually bounce back. In the meantime, investors would be wise to keep a close eye on the entertainment giant's progress.Undoubtedly, Disney is on a path of change under the leadership of Iger. Despite the mixed fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, many analysts have kept a buy rating on the companys shares due to changes like the improvement of streaming operations, the booming success of Marvel films, the advertising power of ESPN and more. The company is on the right path as Iger begins to focus on restructuring operations.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

More than $200 million of that total stemmed from mainland China.""That market has only grown since,"" Robbins added. ""We even saw multiple re-releases of that original film draw considerable revenue in China over the last few years. I really anticipate this is going to add a significant amount to the bottom line for 'Way of Water.'""The sequel's reported production budget of $250 million-plus, which director James Cameron noted makes it ""the worst business case in movie history,"" will have to be the third or fourth highest-grossing film just to break even.One risk remains increased lockdowns amid Beijing's zero-COVID policy. That, coupled with the lack of Hollywood-approved films, have heavily weighed on China's theatrical ecosystem, with the country's box office down 35% compared to the same point in 2021, according to data from consultancy Artisan Gateway, cited by Variety.""This just goes to the nebulous aspect of forecasting what's going to happen in China — whether it's the box office, government related, or pandemic related, there's so many factors in play here,"" Robbins said.Box Office to welcome re-release of Disney's 'Avatar' (Courtesy: 20th Century Studios)A Hollywood... without China?Hollywood-China relations peaked between 2012-2016, but the Chinese market began to turn its back on the U.S. right around 2018. At that time, regulation of the country's film management was assigned to the Communist Party's propaganda department.Last year, ""Fast &amp; Furious"" star John Cena came under intense scrutiny after apologizing to China — in Mandarin — for calling Taiwan a country, underscoring Hollywood’s profit pursuit.Story continuesChina has long been a major moneymaker for the movie industry — but the country has increased its censorship rules in recent years with major titles including Disney's ""Black Widow,"" ""Eternals,"" and ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"" along with Warner Bros. ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" all denied China releases.U.S. blockbusters denied China releasesReasons for denial can include anything the government deems inappropriate, such as depictions of homosexuality or content the government believes violates the country's values.""The lessons of the past year or so have have really underscored that studios have to start taking into account that their [biggest], most expensive tentpoles might not get a release in China,"" Robbins said.""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" was denied after producers refused to remove the Statue of Liberty from the film, while Chinese regulators quickly rejected ""Top Gun: Maverick"" due to the presence of the Taiwanese flag on the back of Tom Cruise's Capt. Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell's combat jacket. Beijing does not recognize Taiwan as an independent country.Despite the lack of a China release, both ""Spider-Man"" and ""Maverick"" went on to secure global receipts of $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Hollywood insiders cited the results as a major turning point when it comes to the complicated Hollywood-China relationship.""The fact that China now is not as important to Hollywood is a fantastic thing for the creative expression of these filmmakers,"" Chris Fenton, movie producer and author of the book ""Feeding the Dragon,"" previously told Yahoo Finance Live.""We can still make movies without integrating China propaganda or narrative into them, and if they're relevant, if they're universal in tone, there will be consumer markets [in China] for future movies,"" Fenton said. ""But right now we don't have to placate Beijing with every single movie that we make.""Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

To skip the industry analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Electrical Companies in the USA.Utility stocks such as electric utilities are among the favorites of conservative investors, especially during a recession. These stocks have a low beta, which means market volatility doesn’t affect them much.Utility companies are heavily regulated, due to which the number of competitors of these companies is fewer compared to other sectors of the market. This allows investors to easily predict the revenues and profits of these companies.Up until mid-September, utility companies, including electrical companies, were among the best-performing stocks of 2022. Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU) had a 5% return while S&amp;P 500 had declined by 18% YTD. However, in October, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes showed their effects on the sector and the fund kept falling for several sessions and was the worst-performing sector among 11 S&amp;P industry groups. Janney analyst Michael Gaugler believes the current year could be disappointing for the utility sector and industry ""is likely to rally once the U.S. Federal Reserve signals its rate hike policy is coming to a close.""In the future, the utility sector should rally due to the aggressive adoption of electric vehicles and the Biden administration’s clean energy and infrastructure legislation.Future OutlookThe power generation market size was around $1.39 trillion in 2020 and is expected to reach $1.83 trillion by 2028 at a CAGR of 3.53%. According to the World Energy Outlook 2019, the global electric utility demand is expected to increase at the rate of 2.1% per annum till 2040, and the electricity demand is set to double by 2050.The utility market has always benefited during recessionary times as seen in the 2001 and 2007-09 recessions.

177,fc1162c3-474c-3e51-bb27-7ff460bef6c3,UA,2022-11-24,Investors in Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) have unfortunately lost 61% over the last year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-under-armour-nyse-uaa-110111260.html,1669287671,STORY,['UAA'],"[Over the last month the Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) has been much stronger than before, rebounding by 35%. But that isn't much consolation to those who have suffered through the declines of the last year. Specifically, the stock price slipped by 61% in that time. So the bounce should be viewed in that context. You could argue that the sell-off was too severe.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Under Armour To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the last year Under Armour saw its earnings per share drop below zero. Buyers no doubt think it's a temporary situation, but those with a nose for quality have low tolerance for losses. We hope for shareholders' sake that the company becomes profitable again soon.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Under Armour's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 19% in the twelve months, Under Armour shareholders did even worse, losing 61%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 5% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Under Armour   you should know about.Story continuesIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The stock has been a strong performer lately, and the momentum might continue with analysts still raising their earnings estimates for the company.The rising trend in estimate revisions, which is a result of growing analyst optimism on the earnings prospects of this oil and gas well-drilling contractor, should get reflected in its stock price. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Our stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is principally built on this insight.The five-grade Zacks Rank system, which ranges from a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record of outperformance, with Zacks #1 Ranked stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 2008.For Helmerich &amp; Payne, strong agreement among the covering analysts in revising earnings estimates upward has resulted in meaningful improvement in consensus estimates for the next quarter and full year.The chart below shows the evolution of forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSCurrent-Quarter Estimate RevisionsThe earnings estimate of $0.79 per share for the current quarter represents a change of +275.56% from the number reported a year ago.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Helmerich &amp; Payne has increased 25.48% because four estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revisions.Current-Year Estimate RevisionsFor the full year, the company is expected to earn $4.21 per share, representing a year-over-year change of +4110%.There has been an encouraging trend in estimate revisions for the current year as well.

179,db09d80e-512b-3bbe-9ba5-b2c9a58c553f,HP,2022-11-24,Helmerich & Payne (HP) Is Up 2.85% in One Week: What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/helmerich-payne-hp-2-85-170005688.html,1669222805,STORY,['HP'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Helmerich &amp; Payne currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if HP is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this oil and gas well-drilling contractor holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor HP, shares are up 2.85% over the past week while the Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry is down 3.03% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 21.84% compares favorably with the industry's 15.84% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Helmerich &amp; Payne have increased 26.86% over the past quarter, and have gained 110.59% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -2.85% and -13.11%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to HP's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. HP is currently averaging 1,164,106 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with HP.Over the past two months, 6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost HP's consensus estimate, increasing from $3.23 to $4.21 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that HP is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Helmerich &amp; Payne on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

180,99786ea3-9a53-31ee-a841-708959ff7066,HP,2022-11-24,Why Halliburton (HAL) Is an Attractive Oilfield Service Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-halliburton-hal-attractive-oilfield-151903706.html,1669216743,STORY,"['HAL', 'DINO', 'NINE', '^GSPC', 'HP']","[Even as fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has remained the best S&amp;P 500 sector this year. The space has generated a total return of some 68% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s loss of 16%.Apart from a positive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.While oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, with the conflict showing no sign of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC agreeing on a production curtailment mean that the commodity has got enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.Naturally, some stocks have been impressive since the start of the year. These also have strong earnings trends to back their moves.One such company is Halliburton Company HAL. It is one of the largest oilfield service providers in the world, offering a variety of equipment, maintenance, and engineering and construction services to the energy, industrial and government sectors. The company operates in over 80 countries. Founded in 1919, Halliburton employs more than 40,000 people and operates under two main segments: Completion and Production, and Drilling and Evaluation.Let’s discuss the reasons that make Halliburton an attractive pick:Solid Rank and VGM ScoreHalliburton is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock in the Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, which carries a Zacks Industry Rank #25 — placing it in the top 10% of more than 250 Zacks industries. In addition to the favorable rank, HAL enjoys a Zacks Growth Style Score of B, Momentum of B, and an overall VGM Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Story continuesEarnings Beat Estimtes in Q3HAL posted excellent Q3 results on Oct 25, with EPS of 60 cents coming in ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents and more than doubling from the year-earlier bottom line of 28 cents. The firm’s outperformance reflected stronger-than-expected profit from both its divisions and came in spite of the company’s exit from Russia. Total revenues came in at $5.4 billion, going past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.3 billion and 38.8% above the year-ago level.Current Levels Are a Buying OpportunityAfter HAL shares bottomed out (around $4.25) during the start of the pandemic, they have turned around in style. Halliburton peaked in June at nearly $44 but has fallen to under $37.50 since then. Despite this drop, the stock is still up 63.8% this year, while the markets have gone lower. This powerful uptrend during a bear market indicates that investors should take advantage of the discounted levels and start looking at the name to see if it’s right for their portfolio. With the company experiencing the best market conditions in years, we believe that the HAL stock has enough firepower left to keep chugging along. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Analyst Estimates RaisedHAL’s earnings revisions have also trended in the right direction over the last 60 days, as analysts have consistently taken up their numbers. As a matter of fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Halliburton’s 2022 bottom line has increased from a profit of $2.01 to a profit of $2.09 during this timeframe, while next year’s estimate has seen a rise from a profit of $2.77 per share to $2.94.Fundamental StrengthWhile Halliburton has operations in more than 70 countries, it generates 45% of its revenues in North America. This outsized exposure to the region, especially through its market-leading pressure pumping operations, nicely positions the company to take advantage of the rising U.S. land drilling activity, tightening supply/demand fundamentals and pricing momentum.The successful and expanded use of digital technologies has helped Halliburton enhance performance and lower operational risk. Simply put, it has allowed the company to remove equipment and/or crew from the site, substituting with software solutions. With fewer personnel on location, jobs being monitored offsite using remote data center management tools, and the replacement of expensive hardware with software solutions, the operator is able to reduce costs and capital investment. In other words, the increasing cloud-based data flow between the site and the back office translates into expanded margins for oilfield service providers like Halliburton.Bottom LineThe current scenario makes this a solid time to consider buying Halliburton. Yes, there are some apprehensions that the company may feel the reverberating impacts of the inflation-triggered cost increases. But with international activity set to gain momentum throughout the globe, HAL’s state-of-the-art portfolio, selective contract wins and balanced geographic mix will help it maximize profits from this upcycle.The Houston-based company’s cash flow generation capabilities and balance sheet strength should also ensure increased shareholder returns. All these should support higher price points for its shares.Other Energy Stocks to BuyAlong with Halliburton, investors interested in the energy sector might look at Helmerich &amp; Payne HP, HF Sinclair DINO and Nine Energy Service NINE, each currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Helmerich &amp; Payne: HP beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters.

(NYSE:PX) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sure-check-p10-inc-nyse-102625667.html,1669285585,STORY,['PX'],"[It looks like P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase P10's shares on or after the 29th of November, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 20th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.03 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.12 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, P10 has a trailing yield of approximately 1.2% on its current stock price of $10.19. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for P10 Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. P10 paid out just 25% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. It's encouraging to see P10 has grown its earnings rapidly, up 37% a year for the past five years.Story continuesWe'd also point out that P10 issued a meaningful number of new shares in the past year. It's hard to grow dividends per share when a company keeps creating new shares.Given that P10 has only been paying a dividend for a year, there's not much of a past history to draw insight from.The Bottom LineShould investors buy P10 for the upcoming dividend? When companies are growing rapidly and retaining a majority of the profits within the business, it's usually a sign that reinvesting earnings creates more value than paying dividends to shareholders. Perhaps even more importantly - this can sometimes signal management is focused on the long term future of the business. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating P10 more closely.In light of that, while P10 has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Our analysis shows 1 warning sign for P10 and you should be aware of this before buying any shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

(URI) could be a good stock pick from a technical perspective. URI recently experienced a ""golden cross"" event, which saw its 50-day simple moving average breaking out above its 200-day simple moving average.There's a reason traders love a golden cross -- it's a technical chart pattern that can indicate a bullish breakout is on the horizon. This kind of crossover is formed when a stock's short-term moving average breaks above a longer-term moving average. Typically, a golden cross involves the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.Golden crosses have three key stages that investors look out for. It starts with a downtrend in a stock's price that eventually bottoms out, followed by the stock's shorter moving average crossing over its longer moving average and triggering a trend reversal. The final stage is when a stock continues the upward climb to higher prices.A golden cross is the opposite of a death cross, another technical event that indicates bearish price movement may be on the horizon.Over the past four weeks, URI has gained 20.8%. The company currently sits at a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, also indicating that the stock could be poised for a breakout.The bullish case solidifies once investors consider URI's positive earnings outlook.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Data Mining Companies in the World. Data mining is one of the most important industries today, particularly when it comes to corporate functioning. Modern day businesses generate unfathomable amounts of data daily, and this information is useless unless the right set of tools is used to generate and deliver insights.The process, called data mining, is crucial to the operation of both large and small businesses. Its importance is clear when we take a look at market value and growth estimates. This market rivals the value of established and dominating industries such as crude oil, with a research report from Fortune Business Insights outlining that the process mining software market will be worth $933 million by the end of this year, and despite this sizeable value, it will nevertheless grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 49.5% to sit at a whopping $15,546.4 million by 2029. Process mining is similar to data mining, and it involves using tools to specifically map out business processes and generate insights for improvement. The growth and scope of the industry are understood better when statistics are taken into account.As Fortune Business Insights states, according to Accenture, 88% of businesses that used machine learning saw a 200% improvement in their operations. Machine learning is an advanced form of data mining that leverages large data sets to decipher patterns. These are then used to predict future outcomes, such as banking fraud or equipment downtimes and failures. According to the research firm, Europe will dominate the sector in terms of market value, while North America will be the fastest growing. These conclusions are in stark contrast with estimates for other segments that have often pegged Asia Pacific as the fastest growing region for a variety of industries such as consumer technology.Story continuesThis article casts a wide net and it looks at a host of data mining companies, such as those which provide the software and those that power the software with the hardware along with others that utilize data mining for their daily operations.

192,9162bcf4-2cea-3abc-beb2-d769562ad6d9,MCD,2022-11-24,McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 69% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonalds-corporation-nyse-mcd-largely-130051864.html,1669294851,STORY,['MCD'],"[A look at the shareholders of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 69% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of McDonald's. See our latest analysis for McDonald's ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.McDonald's already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see McDonald's' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in McDonald's. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.2%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.8% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.7% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of McDonald'sWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that McDonald's Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$190m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 31% stake in McDonald's. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for PACCAR What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.43bUS$2.58bUS$2.60bUS$2.58bUS$2.59bUS$2.60bUS$2.63bUS$2.67bUS$2.71bUS$2.75bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 0.17%Est @ 0.71%Est @ 1.09%Est @ 1.36%Est @ 1.55%Est @ 1.68% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8% US$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.8%– 2.0%) = US$48bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$48b÷ ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$22bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$40b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$106, the company appears about fair value at a 7.9% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PACCAR as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.144. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like ResMed (NYSE:RMD). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for ResMed ResMed's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Shareholders will be happy to know that ResMed's EPS has grown 22% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. ResMed maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 8.2% to US$3.6b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for ResMed?Story continuesAre ResMed Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$34b company like ResMed. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$294m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.9% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Does ResMed Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?For growth investors, ResMed's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. You still need to take note of risks, for example - ResMed has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Although ResMed certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$46.0, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. In light of that, when we looked at Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Mondelez International, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.087 = US$4.7b ÷ (US$68b - US$14b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Mondelez International has an ROCE of 8.7%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Food industry average of 9.8%. Check out our latest analysis for Mondelez International roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Mondelez International compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Mondelez International.How Are Returns Trending?Things have been pretty stable at Mondelez International, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So unless we see a substantial change at Mondelez International in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. This probably explains why Mondelez International is paying out 51% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Mondelez International's ROCEWe can conclude that in regards to Mondelez International's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 73% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.Mondelez International does have some risks, we noticed   3 warning signs  (and 1 which is concerning)  we think you should know about.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

200,31ae8814-a5f1-3b0d-bb9f-d9bb7d4780f2,COF,2022-11-24,How I’m adjusting my holiday shopping in an uncertain economy,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/m-adjusting-holiday-shopping-uncertain-185201963.html,1669229521,STORY,['COF-PJ'],"[This article was originally published on Bankrate.com.While fall is my favorite season, winter has all my favorite holidays. I look forward to the cooler weather, the Christmas tree search, the cookie decorating and, yes, even the present shopping. While I would love to get wrapped up in the whimsy of the season, I’ve also been paying attention to rising inflation, mailing delays, the growing trend for businesses to do pre-orders and smaller launches that may or may not be restocked later.So even though I usually wouldn’t think of shopping until November, gathering all my goodies in one or two well-planned trips, I couldn’t risk starting so late. And I’m not alone. In fact, 40% of people were right along with me, adjusting their timeline, according to a recent Bankrate survey. With the unpredictability of the last few months, I refused to be the person battling over the last toy in the store aisle. So, I’m making my list, checking it twice—and getting my planner ready.Here’s what I’m doing to adjust my holiday spending for the 2022 holiday season.I’m starting earlyLike many others, I decided to start my Christmas shopping early—mid-October, in fact. This was helped by the fact that I had been creating a present list throughout the year, so I knew what I wanted to get by the time fall started. I also knew what to get first. If someone wants a book or scarf, that’ll be much easier to get during a Black Friday sale than a customized gift, such as engraved jewelry or customized clothing. This alone took a lot of the stress off my plate.Another thing that has helped a lot is my card’s 0% intro APR offer. For my card, it lasts 15 months, and there are other cards that offer even longer intro APR periods. While interest can seem like a small thing initially, it’s what’s getting affected the most from the inflation hikes. By using this feature, this will not only cover all my holiday expenses but also give me time to recover once the Christmas lights are taken down.Story continuesSuggested card: Citi Custom Cash CardWith a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months (then a 17.74% to 27.74% variable APR), the Citi Custom Cash℠ Card gives you plenty of time to pay off your balance without interest. You also earn 5% cash back on your highest spend category (up to $500, then 1%), so no matter how you shop, you can be rewarded. Be sure to compare your options when choosing a 0% intro APR card to find the best one for your needs.I’m shopping salesI’m sure I’m not the only one hearing mentions of “Black Friday sales all month long” on commercials, nor am I the only one paying attention. What used to be regulated to a single day or even weekend has now expanded to sales through the entirety of November. Remember all those presents that I said are much easier to get? I’m getting them now while they’re 20 to 50% off.Even better, perks like Amex offers or Chase offers often offer 1% to 10% cash back on popular brands like [hotlink]Adidas[/hotlink], H&amp;M, local restaurants, and more, making it easy to maximize cash back while I shop. These offers can last for a month or longer, giving me time to shop for exactly what I want. Check your credit card to see if these bonuses are offered for a chance to earn moreSuggested card: Amex Blue Cash EverydayWith the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express, not only do you get 1 to 10% cash back on popular brands when you use Amex Offers, but you also earn 3% cash back when you shop online at U.S. retailers. It’s all savings with no hassle.I’m looking for hidden discounts onlineImagine my surprise when I found out that there are a lot of discounts for certain brands or products that aren’t displayed on the website when you shop. Without knowing it, there may be an under-the-radar sale on a few products—or, if I’m lucky, the entire site. For brands that I shop often, this may involve signing up for email newsletters or keeping an eye on social media pages, as they tend to announce sales there first, including ones that are on the horizon.Something else that has been very helpful are tools like Capital One Shopping, which looks for coupons and savings automatically when I shop online, my preferred way to shop. Finally, someone else can do the coupon cutting and double-checking, while I debate whether I really need that extra pair of socks.Suggested card: Capital One Venture RewardsThe Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is one of Bankrate’s highest-rated cards for a reason. It gives you 2X miles on everyday purchases and access to Capital One Shopping, which will show you all available discounts wherever you shop online. You’ll also earn 5X miles on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel, helping you to earn more on the vacation you’ll need once the hectic season is over.I shop with my points on AmazonCould someone say that I shop at [hotlink]Amazon[/hotlink] too much according to the piled-up boxes in my recycling? Possibly. However, that does not change the fact that it is indeed convenient and I can use my cash back directly on the app with Amazon Prime’s Shop with Points feature. This is one of many ways to shop on Amazon with credit cards.I’ll be honest. In comparison to other methods of cash back redemption, Shop with Points is definitely not the best. Usually, you get the lowest value when redeeming this way. But for me, it works very well, especially when I consider how much I shop at Amazon. My cash back is easy to redeem and I receive most of my presents and decorations in less than a week, a win-win for me.Suggested card: Discover it Cash BackThe many perks of the Discover it® Cash Back make it one of the best rotating category cards on the market, from its Cashback Match welcome offer that doubles the cash back you earn in your first year to announcing its 5% bonus categories (activation required) early so you can plan accordingly.For me, the 5% cash back on Amazon.com and digital wallets from now until the end of December paired with the 1:1 redemption on Amazon’s Shop with Points makes this a handy shopping tool.The bottom lineWhen I think about the changes I’ve made to my shopping habits, it doesn’t feel as monumental as I thought it would be. While it is awkward to be looking for Christmas presents while the Halloween candy is still out, I love that I’m saving both money—by using my credit card to its fullest potential—and time.So, this year, I won’t have to spend that precious week before Christmas behind my computer or running around a store too stressed to think of maximizing my rewards. I’ll be relaxing at home, watching a cheesy holiday movie.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The American middle class is at the end of an eraSam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire ‘was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas’ who all dated each otherThe 5 most common mistakes lottery winners makeSick with a new Omicron variant?

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Kroger (KR) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.82 a share eight days away from its upcoming earnings release on December 1, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.82 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.80 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Kroger has an Earnings ESP of 1.95%.KR is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Ulta Beauty (ULTA) as well.Ulta Beauty, which is readying to report earnings on December 1, 2022, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $4.09 a share, and ULTA is eight days out from its next earnings report.Ulta Beauty's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.32% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.08.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, KR and ULTA could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The FDA’s request came after the failure of GSK’s phase III confirmatory study, DREAMM-3. As the result of the withdrawal, GSK will stop selling Blenrep in the U.S. market.Blenrep (belantamab mafatotin) was granted accelerated approval as a monotherapy for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients who had received at leastfour prior therapies in 2020 based on the results of the DREAMM-2 overall response rate. The four prior therapies should include an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, a proteasome inhibitor, and an immunomodulatory agent.The final approval was contingent upon a confirmed clinical benefit from a randomized phase III study. However, in November, GSK announced that the DREAMM-3 study on Blenrep in patients with RRMM failed to meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS), thereby failing to meet the FDA Accelerated Approval regulations.GSK’s stock has declined 38.6% this year so far compared with a decrease of 19.9% for the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The head-to-head DREAMM-3 study evaluated Blenrep (belantamab mafodotin) monotherapy versus pomalidomide in combination with low-dose dexamethasone (PomDex) in RRMM patients. In the study, the median progression-free survival was 11.2 months for belantamab mafodotin, which was longer than seven months for PomDex. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR) and overall survival (OS). ORR was 41% for belantamab mafodotin and 36% for PomDex. DOR rates at 12 months were 76.8% and 48.4% for belantamab mafodotin and PomDex, respectively. At the time of the primary analysis, the OS data had only achieved 37.5% overall maturity. The median OS was 21.2 and 21.1 months for belantamab mafodotin and PomDex, respectively.Story continuesGSK said additional trials within the DREAMM clinical trial program would continue. Data from DREAMM-7 and DREAMM-8 phase III studies are expected in the first half of 2023. These additional studies are evaluating belantamab mafodotin in combination treatment with novel therapies and standard-of-care treatments in earlier lines of therapy.Blenrep is also approved in Europe. The drug’s sales rose 28% at constant exchange rate in the first nine months of 2022. Access to Blenrep in Europe remains unaffected.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderGSK currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked large drugmakers include Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX, Merck MRK and Gilead Sciences GILD, all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola is:41% = US$10.0b ÷ US$24b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.41.Does Coca-Cola Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Coca-Cola has a superior ROE than the average (16%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Coca-Cola by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCoca-Cola's Debt And Its 41% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Coca-Cola, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.69. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

Berkshire Hathaway first started buying Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) stock in 1988 and continued accumulating shares since. Berkshire Hathaway now owns 400 million shares of Coca-Cola stock valued at a whopping $22 billion or about 8% of the company.In the 1988 time period that Buffett began purchasing the company, the stock was sitting at a few dollars per share, so Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on massive gains in the company. Coke also issues a dividend worth 44 cents per quarter, so he gains nearly $1 billion per year in dividends on top of that.While you’re unlikely to see those kinds of returns in Coca-Cola stock anymore because of its size, there are still value picks in the industry. For example, TruBrain is a startup that creates drinks and supplements focused on cognitive health and is currently valued at a fraction of what Coke was when Buffett invested in the company in 1988.Buffett likes Coca-Cola stock for one reason — the same reason he likes every company that he invests in: value. This has two meanings. First, he is notorious for only investing if it’s the right price and not a penny more. Coca-Cola stock, at the time, was at a good price with an interesting competitive edge. Coca-Cola owns nearly 50% of the U.S. soft drink market, so as long as people are drinking soft drinks, Coke will be performing well.Read More: This Startup Is Turning the Entire Venture Capital World On Its HeadSecond, and perhaps more important, is that Coca-Cola creates value. Buffett likes “productive assets” in that they produce cash and make a product. The legendary investor has stayed away from things like cryptocurrency because it doesn’t produce anything.Story continuesBuffett has previously mentioned Coca-Cola in this sense. He noted how Coca-Cola produces nearly 2 billion drink servings per day. So if Coke needs to produce more profit, it could raise its drink prices by just 1 cent per serving and produce an extra $20 million per day.Picks like this are Buffetts' bread and butter, and he still likes Coca-Cola stock as much as the day he bought it. Coca-Cola has maintained its market dominance for decades, and as long as it keeps that up, Buffett is unlikely to sell.See more on startup investing from Benzinga.The Startup Investing Platform Secretly Making Everyday Investors MillionsEli Electric Prepares To Launch U.S. Sales Micro EVs Photo: Fortune Live Media from Flickr.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

The lackluster performance towards the beginning of the year is mainly related to the lingering effects of the pandemic, which has hurt a number of players. Estimates have been increasing since May, as the pandemic recedes. Some companies were however positively impacted by the pandemic and the rush-to-digitize trend that it gave rise to. The diversity of players in this group leads to some dissonance.Being the backbone of the digital economy, it's hard to see this industry doing badly over the long term. Overall, some of these long-term trends are playing out this year even as concerns of a slowing economy in 2023 looms large. The negative economic indicators, inflation and geopolitical tensions affect most players but some are better equipped than others to deal with the situation. Despite the beating that the industry has taken this year, valuation still looks rich. But this may be just the time to find beaten-down stocks with better staying power or strong long-term potential. Our picks are NetEase, RingCentral and Verisign.About the IndustryThe Internet Software &amp; Services industry is a relatively small industry, primarily involved in enabling platforms, networks, solutions and services for online businesses and facilitating customer interaction and use of Internet based services.Top Themes Driving the IndustryThe overall impact of COVID has been mixed for the industry. Although it necessitated work from home for employees, the industry, being by nature tech-centric, had relatively fewer issues with this. On the other hand, business continuity concerns accelerated the shift to cloud-based working for many companies, while service providers, both work-related and otherwise, also moved to Internet-based channels. Another big segment that did humongous amounts of online business was retail. All of these moves were positive for the industry (in terms of revenue) and partially offset the negative impact of declining business at brick-and-mortar players. At least some of the positives will outlive the pandemic. In other cases, the return to physical operations is still ongoing, and hindered by new strains of the virus, inflation and other concerns.The geopolitical tensions in Europe have a bearing on oil prices and certain supply chains, and therefore, also on large segments of the economy. And most experts fear that the Fed's actions to contain inflation are pushing us into a recession. Since any improvement in the general level of economic growth improves prospects for the industry, the current environment is contributing to a negative outlook for 2023. The higher volume of business being operated through the cloud and the increasing demand for enabling software and services involves infrastructure buildout, which increases costs for players. This causes great fluctuations in profitability as new infrastructure is depreciated and fresh debt is serviced. So even for those players that have seen revenue growth accelerate as a result of the pandemic, profitability has remained a challenge. The current inflationary conditions are also a concern.The level of technology adoption by businesses and the proliferation of connected consumer devices that might help people connect and do business online also impacts growth. The high penetration of mobile devices among users and the pandemic-driven necessity is driving more businesses to adopt technology that they earlier stayed away from because of the cost involved. This is positive for the industry.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Improving ProspectsThe Zacks Internet – Software &amp; Services industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #93, which places it in the top 37% of more than 250 Zacks classified industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates that the industry is currently in recovery mode.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries is because the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate is improving. The aggregate estimate revisions reflect increased analyst optimism since May and the group's aggregate earnings are now down just 1.6% over the past year. The 2023 estimate is however still down 35%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry's Stock Market Performance Remains PoorThe past year's performance of the Zacks Internet – Software &amp; Services Industry shows that it has lagged the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector, as well as the S&amp;P 500 during this period. But while the discount to the S&amp;P 500 is substantial, especially in the last few months, it has traded closer to the sector, which hasn't had a great run in the face of current macro concerns.The aggregate share price of the industry dropped 50.3% over the past year compared to the broader sector's decline of 33.6% and the S&amp;P 500's decline of 16.9%.Industry's Current ValuationWhile many of the players are still making losses, the industry as a whole continues to generate profits. Therefore, on the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, we see that the industry is currently trading at a 30.7X multiple, well below its median level of 52.6X over the past year. The S&amp;P 500's P/E is however just 17.7X (median value over the past year is 17.9X). The industry is also overvalued compared to the sector's forward-12-month P/E of 21.1X (at its median level over the past year).The industry has traded in the annual range of 75.1X to 29.0X.3 Stocks Worth ConsideringNetEase, Inc.: Hangzhou-based NetEase provides online services focusing on diverse content, including games, music, other services and education (dictionary, translation and including a range of smart devices) in China. Its products and services are focused on community, communication and commerce.NetEase is currently building its international business through fresh gaming content that appeals to an international audience. For this purpose, it has also established its own studios in Japan, Europe and North America, and is building creative talent in these regions. It is also expanding reach beyond PCs and mobile devices to consoles and facilitate gameplay seamlessly across devices, which further helps to grow the user base. Its education tools are very popular, as seen from the high revenue growth rate. The music business continues to grow with daily and monthly users holding steady even as the advertising-supported tier returns. Additionally, the content library continues to grow.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have sunk 41.5% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 2022 loss EPS has increased 37 cents (8.5%) in the last 60 days. The 2023 earnings estimate has increased 35 cents (7.6%).RingCentral, Inc.: Belmont, CA-based RingCentral provides software-as-a-service solutions that enable North American businesses to communicate, collaborate and connect. The company offers business cloud communications and contact center solutions. It caters to a enterprises, SMBs, professionals and others across a broad range of industries including financial services, education, healthcare, legal services, real estate, retail, technology, insurance, construction, hospitality, and state and local government.RingCentral is growing on the back of a several megatrends, including the pandemic-induced shift to hybrid work, the increasing adoption of mobility solutions by businesses and the increasingly distributed workforces, all of which are leading to the increased need for unified communications and contact center solutions. When these are cloud-enabled, the whole thing is better integrated, more secure, more efficient and cost efficient. With an ecosystem of over 75,000 developers, over 150 pre-built telephony apps and over 330 pre-built apps as unified communications and contact center solutions, it is no surprise that Gartner has RingCentral in the leadership quadrant of its latest report. The company is already generating a recurring revenue run rate of $2 billion and looks set to easily eclipse that next year.All this doesn't of course doesn't mean that the company is not seeing the economic slowdown and labor cost inflation that the rest of the market is seeing. Management has been rationalizing the workforce to align it with the changing market scenario. But it doesn't take away from the fact that this is a rapidly expanding market the world over with a very low (single-digit) penetration rate, according to Synergy Research. Additionally, Synergy estimates that RingCentral is the leader in UCaaS with over 20% market share based on paid seats, which is double the second and third place vendors. So, there is tremendous scope for growth.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 company are down 83.5% over the past year. Its 2022 estimate is up 4 cents (2.1%) in the last 60 days. The 2023 estimate is up 28 cents (11.2%) during the same time period.VeriSign, Inc.: Reston, Va-based VeriSign provides Internet infrastructure services, including primarily domain name registry services and also infrastructure assurance services.Verisign is benefiting from price increases of up to 7% pursuant to the Third Amendment to the .com Registry Agreement with ICANN and up to 10% in the .net registrations. The steady nature of the business that is tied to digital transformation leads to relatively steady cash flows. However, like every other company, rising costs, the broader economic slowdown and weaker business in China are also weighing on it. Competition from Google's free public domain name service is also a concern.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 company have dropped 19.1% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 2022 EPS is up a penny while that for the 2023 EPS is unchanged in the last 60 days.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

212,18de976c-a112-3421-8c97-f4152a954bcb,WHR,2022-11-24,Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) Shares Could Be 34% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whirlpool-corporation-nyse-whr-shares-122012408.html,1669292412,STORY,['WHR'],"[Does the November share price for Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Whirlpool Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$906.2mUS$879.5mUS$1.03bUS$1.02bUS$1.02bUS$1.02bUS$1.03bUS$1.04bUS$1.05bUS$1.07bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -0.35%Est @ 0.35%Est @ 0.84%Est @ 1.18%Est @ 1.42%Est @ 1.59% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.4% US$828US$734US$789US$710US$647US$593US$546US$505US$468US$434(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.3bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.4%– 2.0%) = US$15bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$15b÷ ( 1 + 9.4%)10= US$5.9bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$12b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$148, the company appears quite good value at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Whirlpool as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.456. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Whirlpool, we've put together three relevant elements you should further examine:Risks: For example, we've discovered 4 warning signs for Whirlpool that you should be aware of before investing here.Future Earnings: How does WHR's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

It's hemmed in expectant hope, evidenced in new dreams, and proven recently at Benton Harbor's second annual Pitch Night for Black entrepreneurs, a community event hosted by Mosaic CCDA, a local community development and transformation center and Whirlpool Corporation.""The next great idea is in this very room. Why not here? Why not Benton Harbor?"", said Gabrielle Engle, COO of Mosaic CCDA. ""I'm betting on these entrepreneurs who demonstrate the passion and grit required to build a new future for our city, one business at a time. We are grateful for our funders who have supported us in creating a platform for voices to be heard and dreams to be realized.""The first Benton Harbor Pitch Night was held in 2021 as a collaboration between Mosaic and Whirlpool Corp.'s volunteer Microgrant Workstream, one of sixteen workstreams formed in 2020 through its Multi-Year U.S. Action Plan and Equality Pledge, a commitment to business and community support in its headquarters' community.""Many in our community have had to innovate out of sheer necessity, so we knew great ideas were pulsing in the hearts of the people,"" said Kathy Craig, who led one of the Microgrant teams. ""We began with nine months of just listening. We met with potential, failed, and successful Black business owners in the community to better understand challenges, barriers, and hear more about their dreams.We then concluded the most impactful and sustainable solutions were already planted at the grassroots level. Our work was to build trust and heal perceptions. We were not just working to fulfill a commitment through a pledge, but to develop authentic relationships, learn one another's stories, and support solid organizations like Mosaic that were already doing great things in the community. We simply needed to continue leaning in, listening, and learning.""Story continuesIn one short year much more has emerged - literally and figuratively - from those relationships. The collaboration between Mosaic and Whirlpool Corp created a springboard for a newly formed non-profit: Emerge Innovation Hub, led by key community stakeholders including Mosaic, Whirlpool Corp. employees, Kinexus, Guardiian, Andrews University, PNC Bank and Urban Ministries. Emerge exists to create diverse communities by empowering historically underserved and underrepresented entrepreneurs to start and run their businesses in southwest Michigan. It now hosts monthly hangouts for practical education and networking, with plans to launch a fellowship program in 2023 for five local entrepreneurs.For Candi Purdiman, children's author, business owner of ""Kids Read Too,"" and grand prize winner of the 2022 pitch competition, the microgrant will enable her to have more books illustrated and published, build a website to promote them, and launch a reading initiative for children. As a childhood cancer survivor, Purdiman writes books to help children, particularly those of color, cope with grief, loss and issues they face today.Additional winners included Tim and Olivia Nichols, owners of ""ShowTime Customs,"" a clothing company, and Jasmnika Newbern, owner of ""Jaszy Jars, LLC.""

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The strategy outperformed its benchmark in the third quarter, the Russell 3000 Index. Only the industrial sector contributed positively to the strategy’s absolute performance among the ten sectors the strategy invested in. The significant performance detractors were materials, consumer discretionary, and real estate sectors. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2022.ClearBridge Investments highlighted stocks like Trane Technologies plc (NYSE:TT) in the third quarter 2022 investor letter. Headquartered in Swords, Ireland, Trane Technologies plc (NYSE:TT) provides solutions for heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and transport refrigeration. On November 22, 2022, Trane Technologies plc (NYSE:TT) stock closed at $178.76 per share. One-month return of Trane Technologies plc (NYSE:TT) was 16.11%, and its shares lost 8.60% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Trane Technologies plc (NYSE:TT) has a market capitalization of $41.17 billion.ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Trane Technologies plc (NYSE:TT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""Industrials holdings such as process and motion control company Regal Rexnord (RRX) and HVAC and transport refrigeration company Trane Technologies plc (NYSE:TT) also performed well, lifted by strong execution as both beat earnings and revenue expectations. Both companies should also benefit from the IRA as they enable greater energy efficiency in a variety of settings: Regal Rexnord innovates through best-in-class engineering capabilities to help customers achieve their energy efficiency objectives; Trane’s products enable lower energy demand and emissions in HVAC systems and buildings, where it estimates ~15%–25% of all GHG emissions are emitted.According to ClearBridge holding Trane Technologies, under ideal conditions, a heat pump can transfer 300% more energy than it consumes. In contrast, a high efficiency gas furnace is only about 95% efficient. Further, heat pumps are powered by electricity, creating substantial potential fuel savings. Assuming the electricity comes from clean energy sources, heat pumps are also much more “green.”Heat pumps gained prominence in June when President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act of 1950 to call for more domestic production of heat pumps to reduce American energy bills, fight climate change and free up U.S. natural gas to support allies in Europe. The IRA, which provides $500 million in funding for expanding production of heat pumps as well as processing critical minerals, should be a plus for manufacturers and ClearBridge holdings like Trane and Johnson Controls (JCI).""Story continuesRefrigeration, AirconditioningPhoto by Sigmund on UnsplashTrane Technologies plc (NYSE:TT) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Per the terms of the deal, COP will handle the natural gas supply requirements for Phase 1 of the proposed liquefaction facility.Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 will involve two liquefaction trains, LNG storage tanks and associated facilities. The project is expected to produce up to 13.5 million tons per annum of LNG, with the Phase 2 project currently under development.Sempra Energy is advancing the global energy transition through electrification and decarbonization in the markets it serves, including California, Texas, Mexico and the LNG export market. The company will likely make a final investment decision for the project’s first phase in early 2023.Last month, Sempra Energy finalized an engineering, procurement and construction contract with Bechtel Energy for Phase 1. Per the contract, Bechtel will execute the detailed engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, start-up, performance testing and operator training activities.Oil and gas producers aim to drive domestic LNG supply and exports as western sanctions on Russia have hindered an already undersupplied market and put U.S. gas prices into a higher gear. ConocoPhillips’ participation in the Port Arthur project will provide a reliable supply of natural gas and enhance its portfolio.Price PerformanceShares of COP have outperformed the industry in the past six months.

Per the deal, Sempra will supply 5 million tons per annum of LNG to ConocoPhillips from its Phase 1 of the Port Arthur LNG project.Moreover, SRE and ConocoPhillips have also teamed up in an equity sale and purchase agreement. The deal entitles COP to acquire 30% of the equity in Phase 1 of Port Arthur LNG.Also, a natural gas supply management deal has been agreed upon by the two companies. Per the deal, ConocoPhillips will be accountable for the feed gas supply requirements for Phase 1 of the proposed liquefaction facility.Sempra’s Phase 1 of the Port Arthur LNG project is under construction in Jefferson County, TX. The aforementioned 20-year deal with ConocoPhillips entails steady revenue generation prospects for the proposed project of the company in the long term.Moreover, ConocoPhillips’ solid footprint worldwide may assist Sempra Energy in strengthening its position in the LNG landscape as global demand continues to rise.Growth ProspectsPer the report from Mordor Intelligence, the global LNG market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.9% over the 2022-2027 period. This exemplifies the strong demand for LNG globally when nations are struggling to have a reliable energy system for an emission-free future.The recent Russia-Ukraine war led to a sharp rise in the export of LNG to European countries from the United States as European countries were mostly dependent on Russia for LNG requirements. This acted as a catalyst for the U.S. LNG export market. A recent report by the EIA signifies that LNG export from the United States may rise from 9.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) to 10.8 bcf/d in 2022 and 12.3 bcf/d in 2023.Hence, such a strong demand scenario entails massive opportunities for utilities to scale up their operations in the LNG segment. Sempra’s Port Arthur LNG project is a bright example of utilities expanding their footprint in the LNG arena.Story continuesFurther, Sempra is in advanced commercial discussions with many of its LNG projects. Also, Sempra Infrastructure is developing two separate natural gas liquefaction export projects at its existing ECA Regas Facility.The company is also developing other LNG projects in the Pacific and Gulf coast regions. The Vista Pacifico LNG project will assist SRE in exporting LNG to Asian markets. In addition, its developing Cameron LNG Phase 2, Hackberry CCUS, Port Arthur LNG and ECA LNG Phase 2 projects will strengthen Sempra’s position in the global LNG market.Such investments in the LNG arena highlight Sempra’s increased focus on strengthening its LNG infrastructure. Moreover, deals and agreements with companies with strong expertise and experience enhance its footprint globally in the LNG landscape.Peer MovesThe global demand for LNG may continue to increase manifold. In such a scenario, investments in LNG can follow the northward trend as companies strive to take advantage of the opportunity in the LNG market. Apart from Sempra, companies that have increased their exposure in the LNG market are as follows:Clean Energy Fuels CLNE owns and operates two LNG production plants, one in California and one in Texas. Its LNG plant in Boron is the only large-scale LNG plant in California.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Clean Energy’s 2022 sales suggests an improvement of 59.9% from the prior-year reported figure. CLNE shares have risen 34.8% in the past six months.ONE Gas OGS specializes in the design, construction and operation of micro-LNG plants ranging from one to 10 million standard cubic feet per day and related applications. It developed and perfected optimal and cost-effective LNG solutions for small and/or remote gas production locations.OGS boasts a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 5%. ONE Gas shares have returned 27.1% to its investors in the past year.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Sempra have risen 27.8% compared with the industry’s growth of 15.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankSempra currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

221,d52eb37c-6719-3265-b9fc-172cc15a2769,PGR,2022-11-24,The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) insiders sold US$3.7m worth of stock last year which shareholders may not want to overlook,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/progressive-corporation-nyse-pgr-insiders-110054061.html,1669287654,STORY,['PGR'],"[While it’s been a great week for The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) shareholders after stock gained 4.1%, they should consider it with a grain of salt. The fact that insiders chose to dispose of US$3.7m worth of stock in the past 12 months even though prices were relatively low could be indicative of some anticipated weakness.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Progressive The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At ProgressiveIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President of Personal Lines, Patrick Callahan, sold US$2.4m worth of shares at a price of US$126 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$131, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was 59% of Patrick Callahan's holding.In the last year Progressive insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Progressive Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Progressive. Specifically, President of Personal Lines Patrick Callahan ditched US$2.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of ProgressiveI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Progressive insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$241m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Progressive Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Progressive stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Progressive and we suggest you have a look.Of course Progressive may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NYSE:EL) For Its Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-interested-est-e-110133635.html,1669287693,STORY,['EL'],"[It looks like The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Estée Lauder Companies' shares on or after the 29th of November will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.66 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.64 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Estée Lauder Companies has a trailing yield of 1.2% on the current share price of $222.71. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether Estée Lauder Companies can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Estée Lauder Companies paid out a comfortable 39% of its profit last year. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Estée Lauder Companies generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out more than half (58%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.It's positive to see that Estée Lauder Companies's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fortunately for readers, Estée Lauder Companies's earnings per share have been growing at 12% a year for the past five years. Estée Lauder Companies has an average payout ratio which suggests a balance between growing earnings and rewarding shareholders. Given the quick rate of earnings per share growth and current level of payout, there may be a chance of further dividend increases in the future.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Estée Lauder Companies has lifted its dividend by approximately 18% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Estée Lauder Companies? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Estée Lauder Companies paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.So while Estée Lauder Companies looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Estée Lauder Companies that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

225,fba5866c-24db-302c-8284-b3c718be806d,PG,2022-11-24,"UPDATE 1-U.S. retailers add cameras, steel cables to deter holiday crime",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-u-retailers-add-cameras-180355454.html,1669226635,STORY,"['WMT', 'TGT', 'PG']","[(Adds details on guards at Apple stores, Walmart shooting)By Siddharth Cavale and Arriana McLymoreNEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Retailers ranging from Walmart to Barnes &amp; Noble are installing cameras or locking away items to deter shoplifters and thieves as they brace for a post-pandemic rush of holiday shoppers this year.Some, including Walmart, J.C. Penney, Apple Inc. and Walgreens, put in place new surveillance systems or more security guards. Others, like Target and Barnes &amp; Noble, sealed merchandise behind plexiglass or tethered it with steel cables to store shelves.The retail industry has decried theft this holiday season as it struggles with excess inventories and a pullback in consumer spending at a time of high inflation.""Sales are suppressed. Profits are being punished at the time of the highest inflation in 42 years. And now with the cost of preventing crime going up, that's going to be passed along in higher prices,"" said Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group.The effect on holiday sales and profits ""will be horrific,"" he added. ""Nowadays you can see shampoos are locked up, along with acetaminophen and Tylenol and multipacks of toothpaste locked up.... people planning to shop in stores will not want to go in to these locked and over-secured stores. So overall retailers lose both the planned purchase and the impulse purchases.""Crime has been in the spotlight since a spate of brazen, violent store thefts - including a ""smash and grab"" incident during the holiday season last year where 80 people rushed into a Nordstrom near San Francisco and ran out with armfuls of merchandise, injuring five employees. One survey by the National Retail Federation (NRF) cited a 26.5% jump last year in ""organized retail crime"" carried out by groups of people.But it is unclear whether overall U.S. retail crime is on the rise, with little data available on the problem. Total losses from shoplifting, theft, fraud and errors for U.S. retailers in 2021 remained steady at an average rate of 1.4% of total sales, as it had been over the previous five years.Story continuesStill, retailers are diverting more resources towards security this quarter, which could add pressure on margins already squeezed by higher gas, transportation, labor and raw material costs.Part of the problem is that prosecuting petty crime is a hassle, and some states raised their thresholds for the value of merchandise stolen to around $1,000 to trigger a felony charge.That puts the onus on preventing crime in the first place, especially during the Thanksgiving weekend that is expected to see a record shopper turnout. The busy holiday season represents nearly 20% of total U.S. retail sales for the year.SURVEILLANCE AND STROBE LIGHTSA sign of the times can be seen in the small communities of Paducah, Kentucky, and Opelika, Alabama, where Walmart, J.C. Penney, Walgreens and other major retailers have brought in large, mobile surveillance units that record all activity in their parking lots.Walmart, for example, said it has nine surveillance units outside three massive Supercenter stores in both cities. One of the retailer's stores in Virginia on Tuesday was the scene of the latest mass shooting in the United States, when a manager opened fire and killed six people before turning the gun on himself.In Paducah and Opelika, the units provided by LiveView Technologies as part of a pilot offer 24-hour video footage to retailers so they can alert authorities of any suspicious activity, said Brian Laird, Paducah's chief of police. They also have flashing strobe lights and loud speakers to warn potential thieves that their actions are being observed.Others retailers have focused their anti-theft efforts inside their stores. A Target in White Plains, New York, for example, placed all Ulta Beauty cosmetics behind locked plexiglass.At a Barnes &amp; Noble in the Galleria Mall in White Plains, American Girl 'Wellie Wisher' dolls are shackled to the shelves with electronic ties. At another Barnes &amp; Noble store in Manhattan, customers have to carry empty Lego set boxes to cashiers and receive the pieces after their purchase.'PET PEEVE'Major consumer products companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble are annoyed - and so are shoppers.P&amp;G last week said it is investing in in-store displays to avoid having its razor blades stuck in glass casing, while shoppers complain the locked displays and cables slow them down and force them to find staff who can set the merchandise free.""Target has a new feature!""

230,f23a4e25-bb21-3722-95b4-2e1edde8ebcb,AAL,2022-11-24,Why U.S. Airlines May Fly High This Thanksgiving Travel Period,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-u-airlines-may-fly-203008750.html,1669235408,STORY,"['DAL', 'UAL', 'AAL']","[Moving over the worst phase of the pandemic gloom, airlines recovered gradually, with passenger revenues rebounding from rock bottom. Air-travel demand made a stronger-than-expected recovery as people are again booking flights, thereby boosting passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of most airlines’ top lines.Following the removal of coronavirus-induced restrictions, pent-up demand is driving traffic for the airlines. Despite inflationary pressures and the resultant high-interest rates, there is a wave of optimism in the United States surrounding air-travel demand. Given this rosy backdrop, U.S. airlines like Delta Air Lines DAL, United Airlines UAL and American Airlines AAL are likely to have a very hectic schedule this Thanksgiving week. All the above-mentioned airlines currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.To meet the anticipated demand swell, U.S. airlines are boosting capacity despite the labor crunch that has gripped them. The labor crisis apart, fuel costs remain elevated inducing high air fares. However, these headwinds are unlikely to have a significant adverse impact on the passenger volumes in the Thanksgiving period, as people are very eager to travel after being confined to their homes during the pandemic.Per the American Automobile Association (AAA), air-travel during the Thanksgiving holiday period this year is likely to be 8% more than the 2021 actuals. Passenger volume by air this year (4.51 million) is likely to be 99% of the 2019 levels (pre-coronavirus era). Moreover, the prevalence of remote working is currently expected to ease the congestion with respect to air-travel this year as remote working helps many people travel on days where the rush is likely to be relatively less and air-tickets comparatively cheaper.Upbeat Projections From AirlinesUnited Airlines expects to make the most of buoyant air-travel demand this Thanksgiving spell. Anticipating high passenger volume, UAL expects to transport 12% more passengers from the 2021 levels during the Thanksgiving travel period.Story continuesUnited Airlines reportedly anticipates transporting 5.5 million passengers during the Thanksgiving sojourn. The projected passenger volume is roughly the same as the 2019 actuals (pre-coronavirus era). To meet this expected spike in demand, UAL intends to operate 3,700 plus flights (on average) daily during the Nov 18-Nov 30 time frame. Management believes that passenger volume will touch the maximum on Nov 27 (the Sunday after Thanksgiving) since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 460,000 passengers are expected to travel on UAL flights that day. United Airlines will operate roughly 275 extra flights on the said date to meet the anticipated demand upsurge.American Airlines also expects Nov 27 to be the busiest travel day. Management expects 6.8 million passengers to be transported on AAL flights during the Thanksgiving vacation (Nov 17-Nov 27). To meet this demand revival, AAL intends to operate more than 66,000 scheduled flights across its network. On Nov 27, around 5,500 scheduled flights will be operated by AAL.Delta expects to attract nearly 6 million passengers to its flights over the Nov 18-Nov 29 period. This translates into nearly 500,000 passengers, on average, per day. DAL’s projection this year is a tad less than the 6.3 million passengers, who availed the airline’s flights during the Thanksgiving trips in 2019.Expressing delight at the likely high passenger volumes this year over the Thanksgiving holiday period, Delta’s CEO Ed Bastian said, “The holidays are all about connecting with loved ones, and after two years of disruption and unknowns, those connections are more important than ever.” Thanks to the hard work of our more than 80,000 people around the globe, Delta customers can expect the very best service and industry-leading reliability as they reconnect this holiday season. Our teams are ready to serve.""Wrapping UpThe above write-up clearly suggests that passenger volumes will be high over the Thanksgiving outing this year. High passenger traffic despite headwinds like labor shortage bodes well for the airlines. Steep air fares coupled with strong passenger volumes mean that the top lines of U.S. carriers will be significantly bolstered by the upbeat air-traffic expected over the Thanksgiving break. This should aid the aviation space immensely as it bounces back from a crippled stage, thanks to the deadly pandemic blows.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including AbbVie Inc., PepsiCo, Inc. and The Walt Disney Co.

The company has successfully expanded the labels of its cancer drugs, Imbruvica and Venclexta. It has several new drugs in its portfolio, which have the potential to drive revenues once Humira loses U.S. exclusivity in 2023.Skyrizi and Rinvoq have established outstanding launch trajectories bolstered by the approval of new indications. It has several early/mid-stage candidates that have blockbuster potential.However, there are concerns about long-term sales growth once Humira generics enter the U.S. market. Increasing competition from newer therapies is hurting Imbruvica's sales. Slowing consumer demand due to economic pressures is affecting sales of the aesthetics franchise.(You can read the full research report on AbbVie here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of PepsiCo have modestly outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the past year (+12.6% vs. +11.1%). The company's revenues and earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year in the third quarter. This marked the 17th straight quarter of sales beat.PepsiCo benefits from the resilience and strength of global beverage and convenient food businesses. It expects to benefit by delivering convenience, variety and value proposition to customers through its brands. It raised its revenue view for 2022.However, PepsiCo witnessed margin pressures in the third quarter driven by impacts of supply-chain disruptions and inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. PEP anticipates incremental input cost inflation for the balance of 2022. Adverse currency rates also remain headwinds.(You can read the full research report on PepsiCo here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Walt Disney shares have reacted favorably to the leadership change announcement, but the stock has otherwise been laggard (down -38.6% vs. -18.3% for the S&amp;P 500 index). The company's profitability was negatively impacted by higher programming and production costs across Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. Disney's leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.However, the company's fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results reflected strength in Disney+ and revival in Parks, Experiences and Products businesses. The company benefits from the growing popularity of Disney+, owing to a strong content portfolio and a cheaper bundle offering.Availability in the Nordics, Latin America and other Asian territories is helping it expand its user base. Theme Park business is likely to gain from strong demand across both the domestic and international parks.

Boots are somewhat resistant to online competition because they often require specialized fitting. The company has benefited from its economies of scale and multi-channel business model, which have kept revenues flowing during virus-related shutdowns. Stimulus payments by the federal government to consumers have helped as well. Boot Barn’s private-label brands, built around well-known personalities in the music business, have enabled the company to convert higher portions of its revenues into bottom-line profits. For most of the period since March 2020, Boot Barn’s stock rallied on these positive conditions—and this rally continued in the fourth quarter. We consider Boot Barn’s management to be excellent, and we’ve continually added to our position on periodic price weakness within the context of an overall upward trajectory in the stock.”6.

I had to zoom in just to ensure that the logo was GAP.""Gap did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment.The lawsuit seeks to recoup lost profits and unspecified damages, and halt further infringements.Patagonia said it introduced its Snap-T pullover fleece in 1985 and added the flap pocket four years later.It said the Snap-T design has been included in exhibitions at New York's Museum of Modern Art and London's Victoria &amp; Albert Museum.Patagonia is privately-held and based in Ventura, California. It sued Walmart Inc last month for allegedly infringing its trademarked logo of a trout.The case is Patagonia Inc v Gap Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-07437.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

Accelerated deployment of 5G is driving the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices and 5G smartphones, calling for solid networking infrastructure. This boosted the demand for networking products, favoring the prospects of prominent industry players like Cisco CSCO, Infinera Corporation INFN and RADCOM RDCM. However, negative impacts stemming from the lingering supply chain disruptions and component shortages are likely to remain a concern in the near term. Geopolitical instability in Europe due to the Ukraine war, weak global economic conditions and rising inflation and crude prices are likely to act as additional headwinds.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer - Networking industry comprises companies that offer networking and Internet-connected products, including wireless (WiFi and Long-Term Evolution or LTE), Ethernet and powerline, with a focus on dependability and ease of use. The products are available in numerous configurations to cater to changing requirements of consumers in each geographic territory where it operates for smooth network connectivity and broadband access. Some industry players also provide mission-critical IoT solutions and network security services to help clients build next-generation connected products and implement and manage critical communications infrastructures in demanding environments with enhanced levels of safety. Focus on developing IoT sensors, drones and wearables amid increasing demand for cloud computing-based contact tracing applications is driving the industry.4 Trends Influencing the Computer- Networking Industry FutureRapid Deployment of 5G to Boost Growth Prospects: Continuation in work from home and the adoption of a hybrid/flexible work model have triggered demand for network-intensive applications like video conferencing and cloud services. This is anticipated to accelerate 5G deployment through 2022 and beyond. The impending 5G boom will likely propel the industry to newer heights. The success of 5G technology hinges on substantial investments to upgrade infrastructure in the core fiber backhaul network to support growth in data services. More efforts to develop smart connected homes, hospitals, factories, buildings and cities and self-driving vehicles bode well for the industry players. The industry players are investing heavily in LTE, broadband and fiber to provide additional capacity and improve Internet and wireless networks. These initiatives hold promise.Story continuesThe Uptick in Wi-Fi 6 Networking to Drive Momentum: Brisk technological advancement, dynamic products, high-speed connectivity, low latency and evolving industry standards define the Computer Networking industry. The growing clout of the latest Wi-Fi 6-compliant residential gateways, Wi-Fi routers, set-top boxes and wireless range extenders is a testament to the same. Wi-Fi 6 — the latest 802.11ax wireless standard — is estimated to offer 30% faster network speed over 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5). This is anticipated to bolster the industry participants’ top line.Innovation in Networking Technologies is Opening New Business Avenues: Growing clout of Smart Home and Internet-connected products such as Smart TVs, game consoles, High Definition (HD) streaming players, security cameras, thermostats and smoke detectors continue to drive innovations in networking. The rapid proliferation of IoT, the increasing popularity of smart connected devices and the growing adoption of cloud computing in network security are fueling the demand for an efficient network support infrastructure. The advancements in AI and ML and the high adoption of cloud applications hold immense potential for companies in the industry. Enterprises are striving to manage fixed and wireless devices in a secured infrastructure. To address the demand, industry firms are driving innovation in networking technologies, including network virtualization and Software-Defined Networking (SDN), which favors growth prospects.Relative Slowdown in IT Spending A Concern in the Near Term: Per a Gartner report, worldwide IT spending is expected to increase 0.8% in 2022 compared with 2021 levels and reach around $4.4 billion. The geopolitical disruptions, inflationary pressures and protracted pandemic-induced supply chain troubles are a major concern. Also, consumers are deferring spending on the purchase of devices which is likely to affect the IT spending growth in 2022.
