If you want to skip our discussion on emerging market economic outlook, head over ETFs in an Emerging Market: 5 Best ETFs To Buy.\xa0', ""Global interest rates have experienced volatility, particularly on longer-term government bonds, with 10-year US Treasury yields climbing again after a brief retreat. However, emerging market economies have witnessed milder rate movements. Despite historical expectations of substantial spillovers from advanced economies' interest rates to emerging markets, major emerging markets, especially in Asia, have shown increased resilience to global interest rate volatility. This resilience is underscored by stable exchange rates, stock prices, and sovereign spreads, as well as continued investor interest in emerging market bond markets despite heightened volatility. Many emerging markets have strengthened their policy frameworks over the years, accumulating currency reserves, refining exchange-rate arrangements, and improving central bank independence and credibility. During the post-pandemic era, emerging market central banks have raised interest rates earlier and by wider margins compared to advanced economies, creating buffers against external pressures. Additionally, the rise in commodity prices during the pandemic has supported the external positions of commodity-producing emerging markets."", 'GlobalxETFs suggests that investors reassess their underweight positions in emerging markets (EM), as the asset class shows potential for outperformance in 2024. Despite representing a significant portion of global land, population, and GDP growth, EM countries account for only a small fraction of global market cap. Currently, EM equities are trading at historically low valuations compared to the United States, indicating a margin of safety and potential for growth, especially with the prospect of a weaker US dollar. Brazil is seen as a promising cyclical opportunity for 2024, with the Central Bank cutting interest rates significantly, historically leading to rallies in the MSCI Brazil Index. India is viewed as offering strong structural growth potential, supported by its large, educated population and market-friendly government. China is considered to have reached a point of ""peak pessimism,"" with consumer names appearing attractive from a valuation and earnings perspective. Greece, having received an investment-grade upgrade, is seen as poised for performance in 2024 due to its attractive valuation and political and economic momentum.\xa0', ""Moreover, the US dollar is identified as a key driver of broad EM equity performance, with EM equities historically displaying an inverse relationship with the dollar. Expectations for EM EBITDA growth are optimistic, driven by factors such as China's reopening, India's momentum, and monetary easing across Latin America. With interest rates potentially stabilizing, investors may turn to EM for growth opportunities, particularly in a weaker dollar environment. EM has historically performed well following the last hike of a rate cycle."", ""Franklin Templeton expresses optimism regarding equity markets in 2024, citing factors such as the expectation of a recovery in earnings growth, a probable soft economic landing in the US, and signs indicating that interest rates have peaked. They highlight the historical trend of emerging market equities rising following the first Federal Reserve rate cut. With over four billion people participating in elections throughout the year, including key countries like India, Indonesia, and Mexico, political stability is anticipated to support market sentiment. In India, the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is expected to retain power, benefiting from ongoing reforms. Consensus forecasts anticipate a rebound in global earnings growth, particularly in emerging markets such as South Korea and Taiwan, which are projected to drive earnings growth in the region by 18% in 2024. Despite this, emerging market equities' price-to-earnings (PE) ratios remain below their long-term averages, potentially offering investment opportunities. While China's economic outlook remains challenging, signs of stabilization are welcomed, and select Chinese companies are seen as oversold, presenting potential investment opportunities.\xa0"", 'Exchange traded funds act as convenient investment vehicles for investors to explore and benefit from emerging markets.

Similarly, there have been reservations about the sustainability of Petrobras’s dividend. However, the government owns substantial controlling stakes in these companies and is also a recipient of their dividends. For Ecopetrol, the Colombian government owes money to Ecopetrol due to the Fuel Price Stabilization Fund (FEPC). This fund aims to stabilize fuel prices for Colombian consumers. It bridges the gap between international and national Colombian consumer prices by compensating producers and importers for this price difference. The primary goal is to cushion the impact of global oil price fluctuations on the Colombian market.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating retirement taxes, you may go to 5 States That Don’t Tax Retirement Income. ', 'Retirees on fixed incomes are often lured in by the greener pastures that other states offer them. According to Hire a Helper, an online marketplace for finding reliable and affordable moving help across the United States, older Americans are on the move. As of 2023, an estimated total of 338,000 US residents moved to a new home, a 44% jump from the previous year. Their primary motive? Retirement.', 'For the second straight year, Florida ranked as the top destination for these moves. This result is in line with similar studies done on migration and relocation trends related to retirees, such as that conducted by U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL), an American moving truck, trailer, and self-storage rental company. According to U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL), Florida is one of the top states people moved to in 2023, with only one state beating it for first place: Texas. What these states have in common is no secret: low cost of living, ideal warm weather, and lots of retirees. However, the factor that precedes them all is that these states don’t tax retirement income.', 'For the average American, choosing where they live has a profound impact on their tax liability. This is why seniors on fixed incomes often ask where to retire to avoid taxes.\xa0 The more they get to save on these taxes, the more of their retirement income they have left to spend on rent, groceries, utilities, and most importantly: healthcare. To help save the most, retirees often search and move to tax-free retirement destinations. The question is, does a place like this even exist? This is what Hayden Adams, Schwab Center for Financial Research from The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) has to say,', ""“Florida's lack of an income tax may seem like a bargain, but property tax there is high, and the government raises the bulk of its revenue through state and local sales taxes. That's why it's important to consider your entire tax burden”. -Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)"", 'Bottom line: even if states don’t tax you for your retirement income, chances are that they are imposing a high sales tax, property tax, or some other tax you might not be aware of. This is why retirees must consider the tax implications of retiring in different states. Doing so will maximize one’s chances of choosing the best state to retire for taxes and cost of living.', 'Hayden summarizes this best:', '""Whether you\'re a retiree, a remote worker, or just looking for a change of scenery, the idea of pulling up stakes for purportedly greener pastures isn\'t that unusual these days. However, the tax implications can be profound, so it\'s smart to take a hard look before you break out the packing tape."" - Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)', ""Ranking states based on tax friendliness is complex and subjective, hinging on individual factors such as income level, property ownership, estate size, preferred location, and the benefits offered by each state in exchange for taxes. Ultimately, the significance of different taxes varies depending on one's stage of life and personal circumstances."", 'In these cases, consulting a financial advisor can be the best foot forward. These people can help you, as a retiree, choose some of the best tax-friendly states with low cost of living, depending on your situation and level of income. They may know rules that you’re not aware of, and they even help you save more in the long run.', 'With that said, let’s discover some of the states that don’t tax retirement income, and also explore where else they’re getting all the revenue from.', 'Jon Bilous/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile the list of states that don’t tax retirement income, we began by listing out all the states of the United States.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Thermo Fisher Scientific's  ROE in this article."", 'Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Thermo Fisher Scientific is:', '13% = US$6.0b ÷ US$47b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.13 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""To begin with, Thermo Fisher Scientific seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 12%. This probably goes some way in explaining Thermo Fisher Scientific's moderate 14% growth over the past five years amongst other factors."", ""Next, on comparing Thermo Fisher Scientific's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 16% over the last few years."", ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth.

You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. "", 'Thermo Fisher Scientific has a low three-year median payout ratio of 5.9%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 94% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.', ""Besides, Thermo Fisher Scientific has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 6.5% of its profits over the next three years. However, Thermo Fisher Scientific's ROE is predicted to rise to 20% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio."", ""In total, we are pretty happy with Thermo Fisher Scientific's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Costco stock is up 62% over the past year, outperforming the S&P 500, but there may be reasons to think twice about it. Should investors stay bullish on Costco stock right now?', ""Jennifer Saibil: Costco has been a market-beating stock for years. It operates a differentiated retail warehouse model driven by membership fees. Costco marks up its products by razor-thin margins to cover associated costs and takes the fee income for the bottom line. The low costs generate strong loyalty and drive high volume and sales, and Costco's model is resilient even under pressured conditions."", ""In its fiscal 2024's second quarter (ended Feb. 18), Costco's sales increased again after beginning to dip into negative territory last summer. Revenue rose 5.7% year over year, with comparable sales growth accelerating to 5.6%. E-commerce was a strong driver, up 18.4% over last year."", 'But the real story is in the membership. Costco is still experiencing some pressure from consumers waiting on large-ticket items and switching to cheaper alternatives, but traffic was up 5.3%. Membership grew 7.8% from last year, and membership fee was up 8.2%. Cardholders increased 7.3%, and renewal rates were 90.5% worldwide and 92.9% for the U.S. and Canada. This leads to stronger profitability as well, and earnings per share were up from $3.30 last year to $3.92 this year.', ""Costco has plenty of expansion opportunities within the U.S. and even more so globally. It operates 603 U.S. warehouses but still doesn't have even one store in Rhode Island, West Virginia, or Wyoming. Internationally, it has 272 locations, including five in China, where it only entered last year and where it has incredible growth opportunities. It's accelerating its expansion plan, and it expects to open 33 new locations this year after opening 23 last year. That's still a small amount compared with similar retailers, and it leaves Costco with a long growth runway."", 'If inflation is indeed moderating and interest rates start to come down, Costco should perform even better the rest of the year.', ""Demitri Kalogeropoulos: Costco's latest quarterly results demonstrate why many on Wall Street love this warehouse retailing business. Comparable-store sales were up 6% after adjusting for swings in gas prices, executives said in early March, which beat peers like Walmart."", 'Yet, the chain barely generated any profit from this growth. Operating income landed at roughly the same $4 billion that investors saw a year ago, translating into a 3% margin. Walmart, in contrast, is boosting its profitability thanks to growth in areas like its booming digital ad business.', ""Costco shares are also priced at a huge premium that raises the risk you'll overpay for this business. Investors are forking over 1.3 times annual sales for the stock, or about twice Walmart's valuation. Beyond the better profit margin, you get a higher dividend yield by owning Walmart stock at about 0.7 times annual sales."", 'Sure, a Costco investment brings its own benefits including steady annual earnings that are powered by membership fees. These fees are highly predictable given that more than 90% of its customers choose to renew each year.', 'Plus, Costco likes to shower investors with special, one-time dividend payments from time to time. Those payments are impossible to predict, though, and so income investors might prefer a company like Walmart for its more generous commitment to pay out a large portion of profits each year as direct cash returns.', ""It's not that Costco is a bad business or a weak stock, of course. But given its huge share price rally in the past year (up over 50%), expectations could hardly be higher. That scenario makes it more likely you'll see disappointing returns if the retailer doesn't continue trouncing its peers on the growth front."", 'Will Costco stock take a break from its decades-old streak of beating the market this year? Only time will tell. Long-term investors may want to buy in any case, with the likelihood of Costco stock maintaining its market-beating status over many years.

Walmart augmented its low-price business strategy by offering a convenient one-stop shopping destination with the opening of its first supercenter in 1988. Today, Walmart operates over 4,600 stores in the United States (5,200 including Sam's Club) and over 10,000 stores globally. Walmart generated over $440 billion in domestic namesake sales in fiscal 2024, with Sam's Club contributing another $86 billion to the firm's top line.

Below is a chart showing the annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.', ""As of today, Walmart Inc currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.25% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 1.37%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months. However, Walmart Inc's dividend yield of 1.25% is near a 10-year low and underperforms 82.91% of global competitors in the Retail - Defensive industry, suggesting that the company's dividend yield may not be a compelling proposition for income investors."", ""Over the past three years, Walmart Inc's annual dividend growth rate was 1.80%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to 1.90% per year. And over the past decade, Walmart Inc's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at 1.90%. Based on Walmart Inc's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Walmart Inc stock as of today is approximately 1.37%."", ""To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2024-01-31, Walmart Inc's dividend payout ratio is 0.18."", ""Walmart Inc's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers.

Walmart Inc's growth rank of 8 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors."", ""Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Walmart Inc's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Walmart Inc's revenue has increased by approximately 6.90% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 58.82% of global competitors."", ""The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run.

While it boasts a long history of consistent dividend payments and modest growth rates, its current yield is relatively low compared to industry peers. However, the company's strong profitability and growth metrics suggest potential for future dividend increases. Investors should weigh Walmart Inc's dividend sustainability, indicated by a low payout ratio and positive net income, against the backdrop of its overall financial health and growth prospects.

Seamless delivery and payment options, as well as strong omnichannel capabilities, have proven to be effective for these players.A dynamic operational landscape due to inflation and other economic conditions, along with elevated costs, poses concerns.

Concerted efforts to unite store and online operations to offer customers a solid omnichannel experience keep supermarket players well-placed for growth.Sustained Demand Dynamics: Supermarket companies have been experiencing sustained demand for essential items, driven by increased at-home consumption habits. Strong demand for staple products, including groceries, medications and cleaning supplies, is bolstered by prevalent dine-at-home and work-from-home practices. These consumption patterns are expected to persist in the near future, as many Americans prefer to work and cook at home. Consequently, supermarket players have been agile and innovative in their offerings and merchandising strategies to effectively cater to evolving consumer needs.Dynamic Economic Landscape: Companies are confronting a dynamic operational environment characterized by inflationary pressures and prevailing economic circumstances. These factors predominantly have been affecting budget-conscious consumers, leading them to opt for smaller pack sizes and prioritize lower shelf prices. As a result, consumers are choosing smaller shopping baskets and gravitating toward more cost-effective items to manage their budgets effectively. Despite moderation in inflation, the unpredictable economic landscape and its influence on consumer spending patterns continue to pose challenges to supermarket companies’ revenues.Escalated Costs Erode Margins: Companies have been facing escalating operational expenses in their efforts to step up performance. Factors such as the costs associated with store renovations and increased wages are putting pressure on the profit margins of companies.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.', 'Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.', 'In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system\'s ""Value"" category.

MGM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 16.76. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 32.34.

Over the last 12 months, MGM's PEG has been as high as 1.61 and as low as 1.40, with a median of 1.58."", ""Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. MGM has a P/S ratio of 0.84. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.02."", ""These are just a handful of the figures considered in MGM Resorts International's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment.

That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn)."", 'Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.', ""Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Salesforce, beginning with the chart below."", ' See our latest analysis for Salesforce ', 'Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.', ""Salesforce already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Salesforce's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story."", ""Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Salesforce is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.6% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.5% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.8% of the company stock. Furthermore, CEO Marc Benioff is the owner of 2.4% of the company's shares."", 'Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 25 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.', 'While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing.

You can skip ahead and take a look at more stocks that made our list by jumping straight to the top 5 biggest stocks targeted by activist investors right now."", 'Activist investing seems to be on the rise, with the number of campaigns up by 7% in the year at 252, according to Lazard. Region-wise, a record-breaking number of campaigns was registered in Europe, 69, followed by 44 campaigns waged by activist investors in the Asia-Pacific region.', 'Interestingly enough, last year we saw some of the biggest companies being targeted by activist investors. Even tech behemoth Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was not spared, as billionaire Chris Hohn, the founder of TCI Fund Management, issued a letter in January 2023, requesting job cuts. In the letter, Hohn, whose fund holds a $6 billion position in Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), said that the company needed to cut 20% of its workforce to bring back the employment levels to those in 2021.', 'Paul Singer of Elliott Management', ""Many other large-cap companies came on the radars of activist investors, with some companies targeted by several activists at once. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) saw a swarm of five activists surrounding it. More specifically, Dan Loeb's Third Point, Mason Morfit-led ValueAct Capital, Jeff Ubben's Inclusive Capital, Paul Singer's Elliott Management, and Jeffrey Smith's Starboard Value, approached Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) over the first half of 2023, as the company's stock was dwindling. Activists pushed Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)'s management for changes and they succeeded, as the stock recovered following some overhauls."", 'Overall, activists seem to be more eager to go after larger companies. SquareWell Partners estimated that between January 2022 and June 2023, activist campaigns targeted 13 large-cap companies, which represents a substantial increase from four companies in the previous two years. This trend might persist this year as well, as our research of largest companies that have been targeted by activist investors in recent weeks already shows eight companies with a market cap above $10 billion, and the top 5 biggest stocks targeted by activists are companies with a market cap above $50 billion.', 'Activist investors are a very interesting group to follow when looking for stock picks. These investors usually take a position in companies and engage directly with their boards and management seeking changes to unlock shareholder value. This can involve anything from management changes and cost cuts to splitting the targeted company and the outright sale of the entire business.', 'But why is shareholder activism on the rise lately? Well, there are several reasons that can be highlighted. One is the cooldown of the global economy. Even though it seems the US economy might actually succeed to ""soft land"" as many experts predict, the economic growth still looks tepid and, other countries (see Germany) are heading towards a recession. In turn this means that companies are looking at slower revenue growth and more narrow bottom lines. According to FactSet, the blended annual earnings growth rate for the fourth quarter of 2023 is 1.6%, which is significantly lower than the 5-year average growth of 9.5%. This is based on data from S&P 500 companies that either reported their actual results by February 2 (around 46% of the companies) and estimates for companies that were yet to report their results.', 'In this environment, it\'s understandable why activist investors are seeking for companies to take some actions to improve profitability. The aforementioned Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) became targets of activist investors who demanded exactly that. Chris Hohn requested Google parent company Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to cut 20% of its workforce, but also said that the company needs to ""address excessive employee compensation,"" pointing out that the median salary in 2021 was $300,000. Regarding Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), one of the activists, Starboard Value, reportedly expressed displeasure at the company\'s expenses. Moreover, reports allege that many investors (potentially including activists) are disappointed about the integration of the workplace messaging app Slack, which was acquired in 2021 for nearly $28 billion, and might be questioning whether it needs to be sold.', ""Another reason behind the growth of shareholder activism is the ascend of the so-called ESG investing. ESG, which stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance, is a fairly new trend, where investors buy shares of the company not just because of the company's value, but also because the company scores high on the ESG metrics. According to a survey conducted by deVere Group, 56% of polled investors, plan to increase their ESG-focused holdings this year. Amid this trend, some activist investors have positioned themselves as ESG-focused. For example, Jeff Ubben has left ValueAct and launched Inclusive Fund, a firm focused entirely on sustainable businesses. As you will see later on in our breakdown of biggest stocks targeted by activist investors, some companies made our list because they got on the radars of ESG investors."", 'Paul Singer of Elliott Management', 'Our Methodology', 'To identify the biggest stocks targeted by activist investors right now, we looked for companies that made the headlines in the context of renowned activist investors taking a position in the company in the recent weeks, or companies that were covered in the news in the context of recent activist campaign updates. We then ranked these companies based on their latest market capitalization.', 'Market Cap: $8.57 billion', ""Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY)'s stock has been underperforming lately, dropping by 30% over the last year. During the fourth-quarter earnings call, the company's CEO Josh Silverman highlighted macroeconomic headwinds as impacting the company, but also adding that their belief is that this is a temporary situation."", '""But this is a time when I think products that are not the cheapest possible are out of favor. And I don’t think that’s forever. When I imagine, going forward, does everyone always wants the cheapest version of any given product? No, absolutely not. I think that that trend, this is a cycle, we’re in a moment in the cycle, and I think we’ll move to better moments in the cycle, hopefully, soon,"" Silverman said.', 'In the meantime, Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY) found itself in the cross-hairs of activist investor Paul Singer, whose fund Elliott Management owns 1.90 million shares as of the end of December. Not only did Elliott acquire a position in the company, but as of the beginning of February, the investor also obtained board representation. Marc Steinberg, an Elliott partner, upon joining the board, said in a press release that he believes that Etsy provides an opportunity for value creation and he will be working with the board and management to improve customer experience, accelerate growth and drive value over the long run.', ""At the end of December, there were 32 funds in our database bullish on Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY), unchanged over the quarter. Among these funds, the top shareholder is Brian Bares' Bares Capital Management, which holds 4.08 million shares."", 'Market Cap: $9.09 billion', ""In addition to adding Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY) to its equity portfolio during the fourth quarter, Elliott Management also acquired a position in Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH), a company that owns dating platform Tinder. In its latest 13F filing, Elliott reported holding 3.0 million shares of Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH), although reports in January indicated that Elliott's stake could be as high as 9.5% of the company. However, Elliott has not yet announced any plans regarding its investment in the company."", ""Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH)'s stock has been losing ground, having declined by 80% since 2021. For the fourth quarter, the company posted EPS of $1.08 and its revenue of $866.23 million, an increase of 10.19% on the year. During the earnings call, CEO Bernard Kim said that in 2024, Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH) plans to leverage AI to enhance the user experience for its Tinder platform."", 'Market Cap: $11.26 billion', 'During the fourth quarter, Dallas-based Anson Fund acquired a fairly small position in cloud communications company Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO), having reported ownership of 440,540 shares plus Call options, in its latest 13F filing. Nevertheless, the fund took an activist stance towards the company and has already claimed a victory. In January, Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO) CEO Jeff Lawson stepped down and resigned from the Board of Directors. Anson Funds, together with Legion Capital, which holds 601,050 shares, as of the end of December, have been pressuring company for over a year to divest assets in order to boost shareholder value, according to reports.', 'Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO)\'s stock slid by more than 80% over the last three years amid disappointing performance and currently represents one of the best beaten-down stocks to buy right now. During the fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Khozema Shipchandler pointed out that its Twilio Segment business continued to underperform and the company had been conducting an operational review of the segment. When asked whether the conclusion of the review might result in a sale of the segment, Shipchandler said that they are approaching the review ""with an open mind.""', ""At the end of December, there were 47 funds tracked by Insider Monkey bullish on Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO), up by four funds over the quarter. Among these investors, David Blood And Al Gore's Generation Investment Management is the top shareholder with a stake comprising 8.50 million shares."", 'Market Cap: $15.50 billion', 'Next in our list of biggest stocks targeted by activist investors is Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB), a $15.5 billion a technology company that supports a number of industries, including construction, agriculture, natural resources, and utilities. In December, Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB) got in the cross-hairs of activist investor Barry Rosenstein, whose fund Jana Partners acquired a new position containing 3.76 million shares during the fourth quarter. When disclosing the position, Jana Partners said they would request the company to halt acquisitions and focus on organic growth and improving margins. In January, Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB) announced a buyback worth $800 million and added two new board members.', ""At the end of December, there were 29 funds with long positions in Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB), up by three over the quarter. Besides Jana Partners, other funds bullish on the company include Generation Investment Management and Robert Joseph Caruso's Select Equity Group, which own 12.27 million shares and 6.24 million shares, respectively."", 'Market Cap: $21.52 billion', ""Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILNM) saw 58 funds from our database holding its shares as of the end of December. One of these investors is Carl Icahn's Icahn Capital, which owns 430,000 shares, according to its latest 13F filing. Another activist investor that acquired shares of Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is Keith Meister's Corvex Capital, which holds 730,084 shares. Icahn has been after Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) for awhile, but in December, the investor said it planned to oust the board. Previously, the activist had been criticizing the acquisition of cancer test maker Grail and in December Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) announced plans to divest Grail."", 'Nevertheless, in his open letter to shareholders, Icahn said:', '""We have major misgivings that as long as this current board remains in power, even if there is a divestiture, it will come with far too many strings attached.

At this time, I'd like to hand the call over to Robert Piconi."", 'Robert Piconi', ""Well, thank you, Bernie. And I'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call for announcing results on our second year now as a public company, which happens to be also our 2nd year of revenue, as you tend to do, sometimes that can be helpful to step back and zoom out, if you will, and look at how we progress these past two years, as I did after our first year, we've grown this company as a public company globally in unprecedented ways across multiple continents, multiple technologies while serving different customer segments, public utilities, independent power players and large industrial energy users.The result has been the fastest growing company in energy storage in only our first two years. We continue to monetize our long-duration gravity technology via regional license and royalty agreements that will pay long-term dividends and royalties and capped a tremendous second half of 2023, executing multiple battery energy storage projects across the US market with a newly developed energy management software platform that is winning rave reviews from customers and has been a key differentiator in our rapid commissioning timeframes and ability to quickly get through commissioning and site energization regardless of the underlying hardware.I think finally -- and as a testament to our strategy of solving customer problems as an energy storage solutions provider, we began construction on a first-of-its-kind green hydrogen hybrid energy storage system to provide multi storage to the city of Calistoga, California for Pacific Gas and Electric, California's largest utility energy Vault uniquely will own this system under a tolling agreement to PG&E as we also presented the only fully sustainable solution to replace their prior diesel generation systems historically used to secure continuous power, and it will be operational in the mid part of this year. Those are some of the key highlights, very proud of our progress, our delivery in our first two years and never been more excited about what the future holds as I am now as we continue to push boundaries and innovation while fortifying strong customer relationships that will be the basis of our future.Clearly, we continue to operate in our sector and a very volatile capital market. And despite that, the team has remained focused on the most important investor priorities. And I would say there are three of those first executing for our customers and keeping the customer loyalty that are really the key to our future and really the foundation of our house that we're building here after getting through two years without those customers and without those future revenue streams.And with those customers now uniquely as reference points for future deals and future customers, we would not have a bright future. I feel very good about that second profitable unit economics as we grow. You can imagine, as a new company, we're near priced approaching the likes of some of the largest public utilities and some of the most prominent independent power producers. You don't necessarily have the highest leverage in the contract negotiation despite us having I think one of the most experienced team in the industry, which is what led some of the largest customers.They have the confidence and faith in us to deliver for them on very critical projects we negotiated. We put they put their faith in us, and we've delivered quarter over quarter with profitable unit economics. And finally, and I think this is definitely not least from an investor perspective, we have protected our balance sheet and liquidity as a company to allow us to control our destiny to invest in growth and eliminate any dilutive types of financing to shareholders.I think this and as you've seen in our results if you've happened to read through them, which I'll highlight them here in just a minute. This has been an important aspect, in particular in Q4 where we took some proactive actions. As it is clear, the market has spoken on the desire for even new young companies in a very high growth and necessary market for the future of the planet. Must get to cash flow positive.With that, I want to begin by covering some of the highlights from our release with some more color, and then we'll turn it over to Jan Kees, our CFO, to review detailed financials and get to questions off the top. Our revenue finished in the range that we've been reaffirming all year $341.5 million, which is up over 130% year over year and 18% quarter over quarter and within our annual range due to some shifts of revenue at the end of Q4 that will take place in Q1 and in 2024, it's toward the lower end of that range.We ended the year, however, with an increased cash position of $146 million and with no debt, which is above our prior guidance of 132 million from Q3 2023 earnings and projections. This is pretty noteworthy as we have kept and funded projects in California, for example, the Calistoga project for PG&E and taxes on our balance sheet. But we can participate in these projects in a longer term, predictable and less lumpy cash flows and revenue streams from these tolling agreements. Yet we were still able to grow cash quarter over quarter as we began to turn some of our first projects in the second half of the year to substantial completion and final completion.Very importantly, we also reduced our quarterly cash operating expense run rate by 25% to 30% through actions taken in Q4 2023. This should enable a 2024 reduced quarterly cash OpEx of a range of 13 to $15 million. We expect these actions to help us accelerate our shift to cash flow positive as we exit 2024 and for full year 2025 results, which we'll be sharing more about during our announced Investor Day, which I'll be talking about shortly for the year.On gross margin, we delivered a positive gross margin of 5.1%, while reflecting a portion of that a lower than expected Q4 gross margin due only to timing of revenue and associated gross profit recognition that shifted from Q4 into Q1 and 2024 for gravity license and also some battery projects. As I will discuss, gross margins will improve significantly in the first quarter of 2024, benefiting from this shift from Q4, but also due to the mix of revenue with gravity and battery project timing. While this did impact Q4 for both revenue and final EBITDA and EPS this represents only a timing shift, which will be recognized under U.S. GAAP accounting in 2024.And finally, our commercial pipeline continues to expand with annual year-over-year growth of 24.5 gigawatt hours to a total of 52 gigawatt hours or almost 90% growth, but also expanded sequentially quarter over quarter by 5.8 gigawatt hours up 13% shows continued market growth, continued market activity also with significantly larger projects, two of which we are announcing as new project awards in the US for gravity and a large 2.5 gigawatt hour long-duration battery project, representing an additional Continental expansion with a large global IPP.While these larger project awards have large impacts in forecasting revenue recognition and can create more lumpy quarters and annual guidance. They are both quite transformational in size, scope and technology adoption in both first-of-a-kind because of those attributes. As always, we are focused on converting these growing this growing commercial funnel into contracts that further bolster our revenue and backlog. And we remain committed to continue our track record of building profitable growth and unit economics with all new projects we choose to take on. We want to work on the velocity through our funnel.We post every quarter are four stages of our more near term sales funnel that starts from submitted proposals goes to shortlisted goes to awarded projects and then to final bookings, I encourage you to keep an eye on that and take a look at our latest investor website with that update with the numbers that I just reviewed.As you all know, from our announced and executed projects so far, we focus on larger and meaningful projects with strong customers that have a funnel of projects where we are developing deep partnerships over time. I realize for many of you in our investor base, energy Vault is quite a unique animal relative to any other pure play energy storage company, given our unique portfolio of short long and even ultra-long duration storage solutions. But I believe this has also enabled us to be one of the most customer-centric energy storage customers listening to our customers and solving their problems with a broad portfolio of technology, innovation and solutions. It is unmatched in the market.Looking forward, as we are just a few weeks away from our Q1 2024 finish, we expect revenue to be in line with our prior Q1 2023 given normal seasonality of revenue recognition and project starts with potential for upside from items that were expected in Q4 2023. We also expect stronger double digit gross margins in Q1 again, given the shift of revenue and gross margin recognition from the prior Q4 2023.I think very importantly, as we go to investor priorities, we expect to exit Q1 2024 with an unrestricted cash balance in a range of 125 to $150 million. Additionally, we've reduced any remaining restricted cash on the balance sheet to less than 1 million and remain 100% debt-free.Our performance here in cash is a tribute to our focus and tight management of our business as our growth in our cash balance at the end of the year shows. And we project to keep cash levels maintained at these levels without the need for debt or any dilutive equity transactions going forward.As we continue to look at owned projects on our balance sheet, providing predictable longer-term revenue streams, we may evaluate project financing alternatives if they're attractive this aspect of cash management, managing our operating expense, our culture tied to innovation and focus on customers is all ingrained and the employees of this company.And as demonstrated by the proactive actions we took in Q4 to reduce our quarterly cash OpEx rate by about 30% as we entered into 2024. We took these actions to continue to provide strong balance sheet flexibility for growth while accelerating our move to operating cash flow positive, which we have guided for our finishing Q4 this year and for the full year of 2025. We understand the nature of the lumpiness in our current business model and are also taking actions to adapt our product mix and business to reduce this volatility over time.We will be sharing much more detail in this regard in May formally at our first Investor Analyst Day on May, while we are discussing forecast, I want to mention two projects that were awarded in Q4 that are both multi gigawatt hour and transport, transformational and technology and territory expansion. We were awarded in Q4 a 2.5 gigawatt hour DC. long-duration battery energy storage project by leading international IDP. It also represents a territorial expansion, and we'll be sharing more details on this project at our Investor Day.We also announced a new development agreement with a large primary public utility in the state of Washington using our gravity energy storage technology to address another multi gigawatt hour storage need regionally in the Northwest. This is so exciting for us as it represents the first public utility in the U.S. with an agreement of this size and scope for gravity, which complements the previously announced gravity collaboration project with Enel Green Power insider taxes, which is now an up up and out of the ground.Most of you are aware that demand for long-duration storage remains more nascent at this stage. Although energy Vault continues to solidify its global leadership role here with various gravity and green hydrogen, ultra-long duration solutions and multi-day storage solutions that are now starting deployment in large scale across three of the largest energy storage markets in the world in the U.S., China and Africa.Specific to our gravity business, important to highlight our territory expansion to Southern Africa, as I just mentioned, across the 16 member stated member countries via a new license and royalty agreement that was executed in Q4 in China and route on, we achieved state grid interconnection as planned in December of Q4 2023 for the first 25 megawatt EBX gravity storage system and achieved invoice power operations also in China. There are now three additional gravity energy storage systems of 360 megawatt hour, bringing the total projects underway and announced to over 3.7 gigawatt hours. China continues to be an amazing bed of growth and growth and focus state mandated for not only renewable generation projects, but also for the state mandated energy storage.We continue to be very excited about the work with China timing and their active development and expansion in the market locally. As also noted above, we have our first USA based gravity project with a public utility with the announcement of the new development agreement in Washington and an application of our technology that's been uniquely applied to take advantage of existing topology to maximize efficiency at a reduced CapEx and thus providing strong economics without the need for any subsidies. We'll be very excited to share more on this project given its scale size an application of a new technology.Moving from gravity to our battery businesses. We delivered and progress final commissioning on our first three battery storage system totaling almost one gigawatt hour, specifically with wellhead electric. As previously announced in Nevada Energy 400, 40 megawatt hour were commissioned on schedule and in record time frames from site mobilization to system energization. Also the project with Jupiter power is expected to be fully commissioned in the coming weeks here prior to the first quarter close regarding our green hydrogen microgrid and ultra-long just storage duration.We commence construction on the largest green hydrogen project and microgrid system in the US with California's largest public utility Pacific Gas and Electric. The project is supported by a 10.5 year tolling agreement with commercial operation expected in mid 2024. This solidifies Energy Vault global leadership role in green hydrogen technology for long duration, energy storage and specific microgrids for multi-day storage supported a note here that while owning this project, our balance sheet will impact near term revenue recognition in favor of long-term and predictable revenue streams from a tolling agreement.We believe this will also result in more predictable and less lumpy revenue streams with increased margins over time, which we believe is best for Energy Vault and our investors. As we scale our business, we're excited to share progress now as we ramped up new systems with our new software platform and energy management system, our proprietary Vault OS. energy management software, showing its innovation right out of the gate, enabling efficient commissioning of our first projects that were turned over in the second half of 2023 and will begin contributing SaaS-based recurring revenues in 2024, albeit small at the start and will always be a smaller percentage of the overall portfolio, but critical high margin part of the portfolio.And our product mix to software portfolio continues to introduce new capabilities, which now includes two additional products that we will be reviewing in more detail at the upcoming Investor Day one being involved manager for maximizing project return on investments via optimizing asset performance using enhanced performance, analytics and predictive models to provide greater system reliability and visibility. And secondly, Vault bidder to provide competitive dispatch continuous revenue optimization via market participation serving the ISO and IPP. markets as well as for our own projects that we manage.And operator, finally, I'd be remiss if I was not recognizing a great year around our project execution. This was an important proven year for us to execute on over 1.7 gigawatt hour of projects announced in our 1st year of revenue as and as a public company in 2022, in which we demonstrated that we can deliver on our promises and complete world-class energy storage facilities on time on budget and at performance levels at or above expectations of our very challenging customers.Although there are many to mention one example, we built commissioned and energize the 440 megawatt hour system in Nevada Energy's Reed Gardner site about an hour outside of Las Vegas within four months of site mobilization energizing the system on December 29, in order to meet the customer's requirement to be online prior to year end.I spent some time at the site with our team on site that was working with the local contractors with some of our partners and the tremendous work. They did to do something that as far as we know, has never been done before at this size at this scale. And within this timeframe, these are the things that go on unseen, and I've heard about these unprecedented turnaround times and project delivery and energization are the night weekends holiday time dedicated by our NGL team to move have an inner to deliver for the customer.I want to recognize all of our employees that make this happen every day for our customers as our first projects demonstrated none of which were without supply chain and supplier delivery issues that needed to be managed, solve, anticipated and resolved to our employees.I'm happy to be on this call today to stand upon your shoulders on this quarterly report to talk about these results. I do not take it lightly. As you know, it is a pleasure to be here and support you and what you're doing. Every day. These customer satisfaction areas and testimonials are proving to be some of our best sales tools as we are well positioned now for the next level of success, both within these customers. We've executed four, as well as new customers that observe our propel our performance. We look forward to providing more detail on our Investor Day and Analyst Day that is scheduled for May 8, 2024 in New York City.We've relieved -- received a lot of feedback from the investor base about getting in front of you in more detail and more detail about our strategy about the evolution of our part of our portfolio and also about a view into where we're going as a company in achieving the vision that we set out at the beginning, the event's going to include new product and customer announcements, portfolio updates and financial guidance.It will include customers and partners who will be speaking for customers and partners that have experience with us in delivery, but also new technology and new partners that we're working with and expanding our growth across the globe. I look forward to seeing any of you that can't attend at that session.I'd like to now turn it over to Jan Kees, who will share some financial details for the quarter."", 'Jan Kees van Gaalen', ""Okay, and thank you, Rob Good afternoon, everybody. Let's talk about revenue financial results, highlighted by our full year 2023 revenue of more than 340 million and within 34% higher than in 2022. This revenue reflects the successful execution across our project portfolio in the United States and they were built COMMISSION.I'm trying to model next going into gross margin. Our gross margin was 5.1% for the full year of 2023, temporarily impacted by the unfavorable timing of a few items. First, we delivered a significant amount of hardware in the second half of the year that didn't have any margin associated with it due to the POC accounting rules under GAAP value at margin on that hardware will be recognized in the first half of 2024.And second, higher margin licensing transaction shifted out from the fourth quarter of 2023, 2024 adjusted EBITDA during 2023, our net loss amounted to 94 point -- EUR98.4 million, reflecting the points I previously mentioned. And for the quarter, net loss amounted to EUR22.2 million for the year ending December 31st, 2023, our adjusted EBITDA was negative $62.1 million.And for the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA declined $3.6 million year over year to negative 14.8, reflecting a shift in timing of both battery and gravity revenue and gross profit from Q4 2020 23 to Q1 2020 for the key non-cash items, added back in the fourth quarter were $8.6 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in net interest income. We do remain laser focused on optimizing our cost structure to realize profitably to realize profitability as soon as possible as the business continues to scale and we remain fairly encouraged with our progress towards positive adjusted EBIT cash.As of December 31, 2023, we had $145.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, leaving us well positioned to continue our growth strategy and execute on our projects. Primary uses of cash are cash, operating expenses and working capital needs associated with equipment purchases for us, energy storage projects as the projects achieve milestones and ultimately begin to generate revenue and gross margin.Some of that cash will return to our balance sheet. In addition to this strong cash position, as of today, we have reduced restricted portion of our cash significantly from $35.6 million, two that we had at the end of December 2020. Restricted cash is now down to less than EUR1 million as of today. Please keep in mind that we maintain a bonding capacity in excess of USD1 billion to facilitate additional growth projects as we desire.Thank you. And with that, I'll end it go back to Robert."", 'Robert Piconi', ""Great. Thank you again. Looking closing here before we get into questions. I want to first thank again all of our employees and that in only our 2nd year as a public company delivered with quality with velocity and profitability across all of our projects model behaviors define our culture in customer focus, innovation, delivery, all underscored by our core values and humility, collaboration, problem-solving and leading as an organization to deliver a more sustainable world for our future.A few critical milestones upcoming this year, full operation of multiple gravity energy storage systems in China, which will generate future royalty streams and help China curtail its current increasing greenhouse gas emissions, which are larger than the next six to seven countries combined delivering commissioning of the first and largest green hydrogen energy storage system in California to serve as a critical replacement of diesel generation for the residents of Calistoga California sustainably and then territory expansions for our entire storage portfolio from Southern Africa to new starts in Europe, Australia and the Middle East.Two things to keep an eye on their priorities this year. We'll begin updates on all those areas at our upcoming Investor Day and then financially very clear, as you've heard as a theme on this call, setting ourselves up in 2024 as a profitable growth platform while achieving cash flow positive as we exit and for full year 2025. As you have seen in our results and forecast, we have a strong balance sheet with no debt, strong OpEx management in place, and that's the flexibility to continue to invest in growth.This has enabled us to invest in own projects with longer term and more predictable and higher margin cash flows, advocates and Calistoga. For example, with PG&E with a long-term tolling agreements for this business, while result in less recognized revenue in the near term fund projects that we would otherwise build, commission and transfer under an EPC model. As previously discussed, we believe this can be in the best long-term interests of our shareholders and US Energy Vault while helping to buffer the quarterly impact of larger projects being awarded on a global basis.We look forward to seeing many of you that could join us in New York at our Investor and Analyst Day on May 8. We will be speaking again on May 7, at our Q1 earnings announcement, we have a lot of new and exciting developments to share that will help provide context on the next 12 to 24 months, given the magnitude of the project awards we've announced here today as well as our ongoing growth of the business.With that, operator, we're now ready for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Justin Clare, Roth MKM.', 'Justin Clare', 'Yes, hi, thanks for taking my questions here. So I guess first off, I just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about the revenue that had shifted from Q4 into Q1. If you could provide a little bit more detail on what led to the shift. It sounds like the projects just moved out slightly here. And then maybe if you could just speak to how much additional battery revenue and then royalty or licensed licensing revenue shifted? And then is that all going to be in Q1 or mix of Q1 and Q2?', 'Robert Piconi', ""Sure, Justin, good to hear you.Yes, we had a combination of, as John Case mentioned, there was the hardware deliveries we took that led to the implementations and towards substantial completion and in some cases final completion of some of the battery projects. There's a portion of that that has double-digit margins that just due to POC accounting is shifting into Q1.Okay. The other thing, as you know, we announced a new gravity energy storage license agreement, and that also shifted in revenue recognition that will be shifting into 2024 Our expectation is that some of that will be recognized in Q1 and then throughout 2024 as we progress. So those were the two, I think main items that are just timing related and even on I think the gravity portion alone we had we recognized that we would have exceeded the adjusted EBITDA EPS. It numbers as well. But those that's the color I'd say on those on the two areas that have shifted and in terms of the amount that shifted, I can share with you that it's a double-digit million amount at this point. And as I said in the comments, we'll be providing clarity around about 2024 and into 2025 with the updated information that we're going to have regarding our some of these larger project awards and as well as our Investor Day in the context of some of the new product announcements that Dave referenced on the release here."", 'Justin Clare', ""Got it. Okay. Okay. Appreciate that. And then I was wondering if you could maybe just speak to the visibility that you have into battery projects for 2024 beyond after you complete the NV Energy project, the Jupiter project, those are fully operational and what's next in the pipeline? And then are there key projects that need to reach NTP. before you could see awards get converted into the backlog and then you can start moving forward on projects?"", 'Robert Piconi', ""Sure. Great question. We have a few projects between awards and bookings. That are essentially you have noticed to proceed dates, some of which are known in other cases and are being finalized. Some of this has to do with some of the supply chain time lines that are not for our scope but around things like Transformers, for example, in the market, which I know as you're probably aware, have some longer lead times breakers is another item. And we also have a set of projects that we can choose to own on our balance sheet that have attractive double digit IRRs. And so we're working on some of those relative to what I mentioned about on potentially continuing to own, not necessarily all, but part of those projects that has an impact on rev rec as well. So as you can see from the growth in the funnel itself, we have a lot of those sitting in that awarded category. We're finalizing the actual starts and therefore will be critical to the 2024 rev rec number. So we're we'll be in a better position to give an update on that at our Investor Day, just after our Q. one earnings on May eighth."", 'Justin Clare', ""Got it. Okay. And then just one one more on your gravity solution was wondering what's the latest on the route on project that's expected to be fully operational and in use in the near term here? And then a sense for the timing on when you could provide performance metrics, would that likely be at the Analyst Day? Could we see something sooner? And then any sense for what might be shared at that time?"", 'Robert Piconi', ""Sure.Yes.We as I mentioned, we were stating or State Grid interconnected in December, and they are actively commissioning that system, especially now as things are warming up there and route on our CTO was just at the site 2.5 weeks ago, and we're expecting per their guidance to have in the second half of this month or in the coming weeks, some initial performance data. By the time we get to our Investor Day, we should have a good set of metrics for you on performance data that system as well as I think as we announced before, there is a second system that's up out of the ground we don't expect anything on that system because it will be nearing its completion for the second half of 2024 and into the first quarter 2025. So I would expect more significant updates, potentially even some videos of the operations of that system by the Investor Day. But as we get performance data on more than likely, we will be doing probably some announcement dependent on the robustness of the data and some of the timeframes on having accurate data in terms of the actual operation of the systems in the places Okay. Got it. Thank you.Thanks, Justin."", 'Operator', 'Joseph Osha, Guggenheim Partners.', 'Joseph Osha', ""Yes, hey, everybody. Thanks for the detail. Yes, just to follow up a little bit on Justin's question. I believe I heard during your prepared comments, Rob, that you said full operation of these other systems following on were down this year. Or did I mishear that? I just wanted to make sure I understand what the expectations are for these other systems that are breaking ground?"", 'Robert Piconi', ""Well, we have, as I mentioned, one system that's up out of the ground. I think we actually put that in our announcement. We did an update announcement during the quarter. This up about five floors right now. And Rudolph remains the focus in terms of getting full operational performance data as there I have to state grid interconnection, they're going through, Joe, the homologation process. They're now they've demonstrated inverse operation. These are all local announcements. They've made publicly. They're a public company. China tend to timing there. So I what I would expect is what I just outlined adjusted is initial performance data coming out in the coming weeks and months that again, as we get things third party validated, we will be sharing that. And then on the other projects that we've announced one ones up and out of the ground. And there's two others that have broken ground on the one that's up out of the ground. They might be able to get started on commissioning in Q4. The others will be 2025 in terms of operation commissioning as well of those systems."", 'Joseph Osha', ""Okay, thank you. On the next question, we haven't heard much about Todd Snyder, Texas for a while. I'm wondering what the story is there."", 'Robert Piconi', ""Yes. We're our collaboration with NL remains, and we're up out of the ground Insider. So we'll get a measure. We get pictures of some of the site and where we are there. We actually have a and a key customer and international customer that's there at the site with the team as well.The other thing you all share with you, we haven't announced this publicly yet, but we are and in the interest of and now utilizing that site to also demonstrate other applications of our gravity technology. So Joe, we're going to be sharing more about that at our Investor Day, but there's no change in the collaboration agreement with Anadarko and enforcing what we're sharing with them on our progress in building up that site. What I'll anticipate to you, as I just mentioned, is we're going to be sharing what we're doing within other applications of gravity technology at that site and in line with our our discussions with them now.Okay."", 'Joseph Osha', ""So I guess just to because this is a site that it's going to be easier for some of us to get to any sense as to when we might be able to roll up on that site and see it work Sure."", 'Robert Piconi', 'I would say Q3 would be a good time to get to the site and we might have some surprises for you there when you talk.', 'Joseph Osha', ""And then, Mike, my last question on your own. I'm trying to track all this stuff. I apologize. Are you made reference on your on your Q2, our call and your Q2 press release by two of our major project award with a major Southeast Asian sustainable energy company for two energy storage products totaling 500 megawatts to be booked in the second half of 23, probably I'm trying to understand whether there it is in your because that's a good chunk of business, right? Whether that's shown showing up in your 2024 backlog?"", 'Robert Piconi', ""Yes, that that project is still in our awarded Poland. So it's not in a booking column. It's in our wording because that project is just awaiting final development. And there's a local study that was done in that on that continent and in that country on for that project. So it still remains in our funnel. It remains in the awarded category, and we're looking at trying to convert that within 2024, that may be a project. Also any one of the ones that we might look to help develop in line with some other comments Joe made about us looking at maintaining some equity ownership in some of the projects as they get developed through these tolling agreements on. But there's active work going on in the project the studies that have to be done, it's a country where on the grid operates a little bit differently as some special requirements and studies that have to be performed and those studies are underway funded and ongoing.Okay."", 'Joseph Osha', ""And then finally, my last West, last last question, I do apologize, I'm trying to understand a little bit more detail what your roadways on this PG&E project on I assume they're not your electrolyzers. Are you integrating using plugs electrolyzers? Are they your batteries or RUDPCMZ.? I'm just trying to understand a little bit more what your role is in this project pair?"", 'Robert Piconi', ""Our Alex plant, it's some essentially we designed this microgrid and the energy storage system with a combination of a hydrogen fuel tank. So to be clear, we are making the green hydrogen. We're procuring it. We designed and sized a hydrogen fuel tank. We announced this. We work with chart on that. We also, as part of the design work with plug on their fuel cell, so not the electrolyzers, but with the fuel cells themselves on to we architected the number of fuel cells. Combining with that with the hydrogen tank, we also architected in one of our B Vault. So to address the grid forming and Black Start capabilities that PG&E wanted. So we architected and designed this entire system brought some pieces to the table. And then we have our energy management system that's orchestrating the essentially the discharge and charging charging in terms of the small amount, there's a single container of our B volt lithium-ion combined with the and the green hydrogen and fuel cell aspect. And that is the project that we're building. We are that owner and EPC. So there's a separate company. We own it and we have a 10.5 year tolling agreement with Pacific with PG&E.Okay. Thank you I could broaden the role of asset until we're managing the asset as well. Is that is that clear?"", 'Joseph Osha', ""And I just heard you say I just heard you say that's a black store capable facility. I assume that's part of why they part of the attraction of this to peaking."", 'Robert Piconi', ""We offer black start. You have oil black started as a portion required is on this is a microgrid backup system. So to be clear, the use case here is something that's not going to be discharged frequently, probably four to five times a year on PG. and E. can probably speak better to that, but it's designed so that in the fire season, you'll you'll note, Joe, because I think you're up in that area, you'll remember that Calistoga was hit pretty hard and they had to shut down the grid until this microgrid. It can work stand alone. It actually is also interconnected. But the design of this is to be discharged during events of what they call PSPS any power shutdown or safety shutdown event. This thing will kick in. They don't need diesel generation anymore. The lithium-ion helps them with some specific services and even even ancillary power by the way that they can use daily. That makes sense.Okay.Thank you."", 'Joseph Osha', 'I understand that much better.And I appreciate it.', 'Robert Piconi', 'Thank you.Yes, no problem.Okay.', 'Bernie Colson', ""And we have about 15 minutes left, and they'll still have a list of people to get through. So if if you can limit your questions, please to one and a follow-up. That would be great."", 'Operator', 'Thomas Boyes, TD Cowen.', 'Thomas Boyes', ""Appreciate you taking the questions. Maybe the first is the royalty structure for the gravity deal in South Africa, similar to the one in China, where it's like 5% royalty on the projects and then about $0.9 a 90% gross margin, just trying to get a sense of how that is situated it is.Thank you. And then the on the other question was just obviously great progress in China, but I know in the EBS system in Texas is going to are slated to use wind blades and the block construction dry seems still on the table. Just wondering if you're seeing that type of demand for solutions in China or are they also looking to use waste materials and block construction something on the yes, on the direct impact on that."", 'Robert Piconi', ""Yes, just to share with you on what C. and TY. are kind of tightening funds are they are a waste remediation and environmental service company. So I mean, they do a lot of the standard waste management and have an incinerator and they are using that incinerated ash as part of their bread production as a part of our license with gravity. We are collaborating around other forms of waste materials like coal ash, for example, and even the wind blade, the shredded fiberglass wind blade that they can use there as well. As you know, there's massive wind deployments in China and about every 10 years, those blades and silver was called fatigue and the blades have to be replaced. And so that is a large opportunity for them. There are in China as well and the similar types of, let's say, reuse subsidies there. And China timing is a player, let's say, in that market. So they are they are required in some cases through their core business to utilize it. But specifically for the energy that was one of the synergies and that we have and that they have with our technology and working with them.I appreciate I'll jump back in queue.Okay. Thank you."", 'Operator', 'Chris Ellinghaus, Siebert Williams Shank.', 'Chris Ellinghaus', 'Hey, everybody.', 'Robert Piconi', 'How are you accurate data?', 'Joseph Osha', 'And Rob or whoever wants to talk about this, but the efforts that you undertook in the fourth quarter to sort of conserve your cash run rate, what sort of line items did you address in terms of reducing costs?', 'Robert Piconi', ""Great, great question. Because we focused in two areas, basically the controllable OpEx. So that's everything from our internal IT cost and internal infrastructure and things like and also our travel, all the things that are really controllable in that sense, but also and things that are related to our infrastructure. I mean, as an example, we're consolidating some things in Snyder, Texas as a facility since we actually own that site now and consolidating some infrastructure, for example, is we're winding down the the R&D facility that had our EFX. or YBX. and so has our EBS system there were finalizing some testing with the build up an outsider. We're going to be doing things there and we had some other things that were somewhat discretionary. We had other on projects, some of them were IT related. There were some R&D things also that we made some choices based on priorities that we saw in the market, which, as you know, in this market in terms of looking at different storage duration and different technology mediums were given our expertise across multiple domains and we invest and invest in a, I'd say, a strong way and in R&D and future energy storage technology. So there were some optimization, I'd say around that. So anything that was sort of controllable we addressed and we also addressed a bit on our given the business model on gravity, where we're essentially continuing to license the technology. That means what does that mean? We don't have to open up offices in places like what we announced for the the product, the 16 member countries in Southern Africa or in China in places because we don't have that and that and we don't have to staff up or keep a certain level of engineering team to go build things directly. They're built by other local EPC companies with our our technical support and guidance, but they're basically executing our partners in the regions. Because of that, we did adapt a bit our both our functional and engineering model to that model. And I'll translate Deca. They were an easy decision, but we did optimize and make decisions around hit some headcount level that were related to the expansion of our business model. And we proactively did that just looking at as you do as things evolve in the market and looking at and where our direct management is required on projects, in particular, these complex projects where we're integrating and our own equipment potentially other equipment and doing some new things that does require a little more hands on areas. We are accelerating some investments in some of the software capabilities. I mentioned that today so. So it was a combination of those things in terms of controllable on OpEx and some headcount related that it was just essentially an optimization of our matching our infrastructure costs and to that to our business model.And then secondarily, Chris, I'd say that it's clear, given the market volatility in our sector and amazing to me, honestly, that with everything we've delivered in only our first two years. And with the revenue growth we've done in positive unit economics and making the adjustments we just made. It's amazing to me, I'm aware of where our stock continues to trade. So it is clear investors I've spoken on the desire to see accelerated road map to cash flow positive. And so with that also as a backdrop, we wanted to take actions in Q4 to enter 2024 at a at a lower cash OpEx rate to enable us to essentially accelerate that timeframe into the cash flow positive and we're going to be sharing much more on that and by region and some new products and things and providing color on some of the announcements made today on May eighth."", 'Joseph Osha', 'Okay, thanks.', 'Robert Piconi', 'That helps.', 'Joseph Osha', ""I assume that you'll sort of give us some kind of regional overview of where development stands and say domestically or I mean on gravity storage projects in general at the Investor Day. Is that sort of where you're headed along with some detailed guidance?"", 'Robert Piconi', ""Yes, correct. Both of those and some other things, too. We have some new product announcements to make it tied to some new customer announcements. So we'll have a Yes, correct, absolutely. Those two."", 'Joseph Osha', 'And if I can give a little sub follow up on that will you have at the Investor Day, the ability to give us a little more color on this Washington State customer?', 'Robert Piconi', ""Yes, we're planning to on that. It's a we're really excited about it because of the nature of the application of the gravity technology. And that's tied to Chris, one of the new product announcements that we're going to be making and so we will be adding more color, one thing to share on these and some customers as they're as we're developing projects with them, okay, they have to go acquire land. So it. And we're very sensitive about sharing and naming themselves until they've acquired it. So it's not to drive up pricing on that land.And when any time you speak about gravity you aren't talking about 10 acres, especially you're talking about large, large plots of land and things. So because of that, we are our customers will require we hold confidential their name until such time as they've acquired acquired the land.That makes sense."", 'Joseph Osha', ""Yes, you're absolutely. I'm going to dig into that one myself, but I'm looking forward to the Investor Day. Thanks for the detail."", 'Robert Piconi', 'Thank you, Chris. Appreciate it.', 'Operator', 'Noel Parks, Tuohy Brothers.', 'Noel Parks', ""I just had a couple of quick ones. One of them is on with the storage market. It does seem that the last year in particular, we've seen like a greater investor awareness specifically of the role of intermittent power sources solar wind that destabilizing effect on the grid. And I'm just wondering as a driver of business to you, has that sort of ascended in importance is about the same?"", 'Robert Piconi', ""Yes, I'd say that that continues to be I mean, it continues to widen what we're seeing in terms of what used to be a massive one to two, our market shifted to a two to four hour market. So the longer durations, meaning was more intermittency there and quite frankly, the severity of the of the weather patterns. And we are driving some of that and so we're that's going to continue over time. I would say, as you know, we've seen a tremendous drop in lithium ion prices and and even then, therefore, the ability for lithium-ion to be utilized and definitely it for hours and dependent on where pricing goes or any other new technologies that come, you know, I think there will be additional flexibility there but it's definitely this aspect of addressing intermittency is more renewables come on the grid and thus the need for storage. We haven't seen any any slowdown necessarily there. We are continuing to see, I think a a strong market in, you know, in shorter duration tech combined with very interestingly and needs that are in this eight to 12 our range for you know some specific applications. And as you know, we we can serve those things pretty pretty pretty broadly."", 'Jan Kees van Gaalen', 'Great.', 'Robert Piconi', 'Thanks.', 'Jan Kees van Gaalen', ""And then last month, when you disclosed the South African license deal I believe it was 20 million over 10 years, and it would be helpful if you have application just take a stab, maybe how many similar deals like that you can envision over the next year or two? Are we talking about a handful dozens and he doesn't pay?"", 'Robert Piconi', ""Yes, no, it's not dozens. It's sub-10 because if you think about where where do we do those types of deals and we're going to do them in places where we can find very credible, reliable, large partners, ideally in markets where that are established that are experiencing growth, meaning where there's a defined market need to look at South Africa. I think that the things are fairly well, but I'd say they're about what they called load shedding which in California we sort of call rolling blackouts. And so there's an absolute need for the storage there. And I put in places where we prefer not to go set up shop. I mean, we're more of a technology provider. I'd say overall, although we have the ability to asset manage as we're doing now and Calistoga on, so I'd say that there would be definitely something if you look at over the next few years, there's other locations that it can be interesting for that model and in particular, say for gravity where Jure is think about it that all that is all local construction projects can be done mostly locally in some places don't have the other power electronics or they aren't making the big multi megawatt motors. So those may have to come in. But otherwise, because of the nature of it's a building and a construction project, it lends itself to on these types of business models. And it's I think it's from an investor perspective, it's interesting because there's and typically licenses that are paid upfront or in some cases or they're paid in cash over time. And then there's the royalties tied to volume. And I know it can be frustrating when you're new and you just do them in the timing of those royalties and understanding when are they going to come in as systems get built and turned over and specifically with gravity, obviously, we're talking about systems that take 12 to 18 months to build. So on. But those of those are coming, they are at quite a significant royalty percentage. I mean on revenue, 5% is the I'd say, toward the higher end of what you see and in or in royalty agreements. So it's something that we're going to be providing some indicators on in terms of when we expect those to kick in on some of the initial agreements going forward.Great."", 'Jan Kees van Gaalen', 'Thanks a lot for.All right.', 'Robert Piconi', 'Thank you.', 'Jan Kees van Gaalen', 'Okay, thank you.', 'Operator', ""There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Robert Piconi for closing."", 'Robert Piconi', ""I'd just to thank everyone for joining and their time and again, to thank the employees of energy Vault and what we achieved in 2023 and what we're looking forward to here in 24 and 25.

Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Motorola Solutions Inc's dividend performance and assess its sustainability."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSI.', ""High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio"", 'This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years', 'How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?', ""Motorola Solutions is a leading provider of communications and analytics, primarily serving public safety departments as well as schools, hospitals, and businesses. The bulk of the firm's revenue comes from sales of land mobile radios and radio network infrastructure, but the firm also sells surveillance equipment and dispatch software. Most of Motorola's revenue comes from government agencies, while roughly 25% comes from schools and private businesses. Motorola has customers in over 100 countries and in every state in the United States."", 'Motorola Solutions Inc has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 2011. Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis. Motorola Solutions Inc has increased its dividend each year since 2011. The stock is thus listed as a dividend achiever, an honor that is given to companies that have increased their dividend each year for at least the past 13 years. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.', ""As of today, Motorola Solutions Inc currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.07% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 1.16%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months. Motorola Solutions Inc's dividend yield of 1.07% is near a 10-year low and underperforms than 74.07% of global competitors in the Hardware industry, suggesting that the company's dividend yield may not be a compelling proposition for income investors."", ""Over the past three years, Motorola Solutions Inc's annual dividend growth rate was 11.20%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate stayed the same. And over the past decade, Motorola Solutions Inc's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at an impressive 12.20%. Based on Motorola Solutions Inc's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Motorola Solutions Inc stock as of today is approximately 1.82%."", ""To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, Motorola Solutions Inc's dividend payout ratio is 0.33."", ""Motorola Solutions Inc's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Motorola Solutions Inc's profitability 8 out of 10 as of 2023-12-31, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported net profit in 9 years out of the past 10 years."", ""To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Motorola Solutions Inc's growth rank of 8 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors."", ""Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Motorola Solutions Inc's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Motorola Solutions Inc's revenue has increased by approximately 10.80% per year on average, a rate that outperforms than approximately 69.04% of global competitors."", ""The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Motorola Solutions Inc's earnings increased by approximately 26.20% per year on average, a rate that outperforms than approximately 66.74% of global competitors."", ""Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 12.30%, which outperforms than approximately 54.36% of global competitors."", ""Considering Motorola Solutions Inc's consistent dividend payments, robust dividend growth rate, reasonable payout ratio, strong profitability, and positive growth metrics, the company presents a compelling case for value investors seeking stable income streams. As the company continues to navigate the complexities of the hardware industry, its strategic initiatives and competitive position may further bolster its dividend prospects.

Oracle's cloud infrastructure business is growing rapidly, with revenue soaring 49% year over year in the latest quarter, driven in part by overwhelming demand for AI."", 'Oracle is up against established, entrenched competitors in the cloud infrastructure market, but AI computing capacity is proving to be an issue for start-ups and enterprises alike. There are only so many high-powered Nvidia GPUs and other AI accelerators to go around.', 'Oracle is plowing capital into expanding its cloud computing capacity with a particular focus on AI. The company has so far been unable to keep up with demand, which has put a lid on its growth rate.

Outside of cloud infrastructure and some cloud applications, Oracle's traditional businesses aren't putting up impressive results."", ""As the cloud infrastructure business grows as a percentage of overall revenue, Oracle's growth rate should expand. However, cloud infrastructure may not be as profitable in the long run as selling software licenses. That's especially true if AI demand unexpectedly slows, or if industrywide capacity catches up with and exceeds demand."", 'Oracle is not a particularly cheap stock. With a market capitalization of around $350 billion following a post-earnings rally, shares of Oracle trade for around 25 times the average analyst estimate for full-year adjusted earnings. Adjusted EPS is expected to decline slightly in fiscal 2024, with modest growth returning in fiscal 2025.', ""While Oracle stock doesn't look like a bargain, the company is clearly having success winning business for its AI infrastructure.

The semiconductor manufacturer is at the forefront of generative AI -- its graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center operations are playing a critical role in accelerated computing, machine learning, and more.', ""After generating record revenue in 2023, Nvidia is sitting on a $26 billion cash pile. Let's see how the company is investing its profits to help position itself for long-term growth."", 'A couple of weeks ago, investors learned that Nvidia has a small ownership position in a company called SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN), a developer of voice-recognition software. The company works with automobile manufacturers and restaurants, and its software can be integrated into smart devices.', 'Big tech has shown a keen interest in voice-powered assistants for many years. Apple acquired both Siri and Shazam, while Microsoft acquired Nuance in 2021 for nearly $20 billion. Moreover, both Amazon and Alphabet leverage the technology for their respective lines of smart home appliances.', ""Considering that other major tech players have invested in technologies similar to SoundHound AI's, and the projected market size is $50 billion, it's easy to see why Nvidia is making its move now -- as use cases for AI continue to evolve."", ""Nvidia swiftly followed the news about SoundHound AI with an investment in a start-up called Figure AI. Figure AI is developing humanoid robots, similar to Tesla's Optimus robot."", ""Although humanoid robots aren't commercially applied today, many companies are investing heavily in the technology. One reason could be that the addressable market is expected to reach $38 billion over the next decade, according to research conducted by Goldman Sachs."", ""There are likely a few key reasons why Nvidia is interested in Figure AI. The combination of Nvidia's chips and its under-the-radar software business could play a unique role in developing Figure AI's robotics ambitions."", 'Moreover, the investment by Nvidia is an important step as the company seeks to grow beyond GPUs. While I see the chip business as its bread and butter, Nvidia will have to demonstrate that it has alternative products and services that can scale as competition in the AI landscape heats up.', 'Many investors see Nvidia as primarily a hardware business, but one of the most overlooked areas the company is exploring is enterprise software. In September, Nvidia participated in a $500 million funding round for artificial intelligence (AI) software company Databricks.', 'Following the investment, Nvidia\'s CEO Jensen Huang said that ""enterprise data is a gold mine for generative AI.""', ""Databricks adds a new layer for Nvidia's enterprise software services business, which is already operating at an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion. This is an important relationship for Nvidia to nurture as demand for AI-powered services continues to surge, and I don't think the partnership should be overlooked."", ""Nvidia's A100 and H100 chips have played a major role in its growth over the last year. However, despite the popularity of these semiconductor models, the company is already designing even better technology."", ""It's marketing its next-generation chips under the moniker Blackwell. Of particular interest, Nvidia's H200 chips reportedly double the inferencing performance of the H100. During the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, management told investors that the H200 chips are already witnessing strong demand, and Nvidia is planning to launch in the second quarter."", 'Following the release of the H200, Nvidia is planning to encore with its most powerful chip yet later this year.', 'The last area that Nvidia is investing in is the supply chain. Semiconductor businesses are generally cyclical, given their exposure to broader trends in technology spending and manufacturing. Over the last few years, supply chains and logistics efforts have become strained due to a mixture of COVID-induced disruption and geopolitical tensions. Nvidia has not been immune to these challenges.', ""In order to keep up with surging demand, Nvidia has had to make some concessions on the cost side of the house. The company has been ratcheting up its spending in order to fulfill backlog. While this includes sourcing components for chips, it's important to note that Nvidia does not make its own chips.

Indeed, of the three main benchmark indexes -- the S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite, and the Dow -- the Dow has by far the lowest rate of return since the end of the financial crisis."", ""What's more, in the era of plentiful exchange-traded funds (ETFs), investors have more choices than ever before. "", 'One such ETF, the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund (NYSEMKT: VGT), is in my view a superior alternative to the Dow.', ""The Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund focuses (as you'd expect from the name) on the information technology sector.

Compare that to the Dow, where Microsoft accounts for only about 7% of the index, and Apple accounts for less than 3%."", 'Next, the Vanguard fund has numerous semiconductor companies, including Nvidia (5% of fund holdings), Broadcom (4%), and Advanced Micro Devices (2%). The Dow, meantime, has only one semiconductor stock among its 30 holdings: Intel, a longtime laggard within the sector.', 'Last, the Vanguard ETF is solely focused on the tech industry, one of the top-performing sectors of the previous three decades. The Dow, on the other hand, is loaded with lackluster stocks from underperforming sectors, including Verizon, 3M, and Boeing, to name just a few.', 'For all those reasons, the Vanguard fund has trounced the Dow. An investment of $10,000 in the Vanguard fund made 10 years ago would have grown to almost $64,000 today. The same $10,000 invested in the Dow would be worth less than $30,000.', ""Despite its recent underperformance, the Dow isn't a terrible index, it just has a specific mission."", 'The Dow Jones Industrial Average is meant to represent a broad array of U.S. companies spanning multiple sectors -- energy, industrials, finance, healthcare, consumer discretionary, etc. By contrast, the Vanguard Information Technology Index fund only invests in the tech sector, which has been perhaps the best one to invest in, given its rapid growth and high profitability.', ""So, we should all give the Dow a break -- it's just doing its job.

As big chains look for ways to counter declining foot traffic and grow beyond the crowded lunch and dinner space, breakfast is becoming a battleground.', '""A lot of competition is now stepping up to win,"" Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo told Yahoo Finance.', 'With the cost of eating out staying persistently high, pinched consumers may opt for breakfast as a treat over more expensive options, per Morningstar analyst Sean Dunlop.', 'That means a morning McMuffin sale may not cannibalize an evening Big Mac sale, but a diner might shell out for some fast food hot cakes instead of a sit-down brunch.', ""A successful breakfast strategy could attract visitors who weren't coming to the restaurant before and complement its core offerings, said Gargiulo."", ""Currently, McDonald's is the dominant player in the space.

In addition to lower staffing needs, breakfast foods usually use items like bread and eggs that are cheaper than beef patties.', ""Once a company's breakfast offering hits scale, it tends to be more lucrative than sales in other parts of the day. Breakfast diners are also more habitual, so chains that make themselves a part of consumers' morning routine can parlay that into higher participation in loyalty programs and digital sales."", 'But the competition is fierce. Taco Bell is testing breakfast tots and leaning into menu offerings like a Bell Breakfast Box. Burger King is luring customers with promotions, including a March special where eaters can get a free breakfast item with any purchase of $1 or more.', 'So who wins?', 'Gargiulo, who warned that making the prices of breakfast too low could cut into a chain\'s lunch sales, said ""everybody has a slightly different competitive advantage over the others.""', ""While McDonald's has a leg up on location, Wendy's has its fresh-never-frozen allure, and Taco Bell is focused on attracting Gen Z and millennials, per Gargiulo."", ""Wendy's is targeting a 50% bump in its breakfast business, says Dunlop, which would put it on par with Burger King, which gets 15% of its total sales from breakfast. McDonald's gets about 30% of total sales from its morning business."", 'But execution is critical in this race. ""Depending on your breakfast program, the labor, inventory, insurance, and utilities costs may rise because you are operating for more hours and are carrying and storing more [inventory]. If you don’t have sufficient demand for your breakfast, your margins can deteriorate,"" said Gargiulo.', 'Beyond fast food, other longtime players like IHOP are also fighting to hang on to their corner of the market.', 'IHOP (DIN) reported a 1.6% jump in US same-store sales last quarter, with 20.4% of total sales coming from digital and takeout orders.', ""John Peyton, CEO of its parent company Dine Brands Global, told Yahoo Finance that the secret to IHOP's success is its fresh ingredients."", '""We\'ve been winning for years because we\'re made from scratch,"" he said.', ""Getting into this high-stakes game will become increasingly difficult as the market gets more saturated. Diners aren't likely to eat two breakfasts, so restaurants can only win share by taking sales from each other."", '""Absent a unique, structural growth tailwind, breakfast becomes nearly a zero-sum game,"" said Dunlop.

I realize we're holding this call later than we have in the past and we appreciate your patience as we have managed through our internal investigation and work expeditiously to complete our 10-K filing. Before we start the business update, I want to provide some perspective on the additional release that we issued this morning on the progress we have made in our internal investigation, which is being led by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. ADM has historically disclosed in the footnotes to our financial statements that intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating market. In connection with our internal investigation, we corrected certain intersegment sales that occurred between our Nutrition reporting segment and our Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions reporting segments that were not recorded at amounts approximating market. The adjustments have no impact on our consolidated balance sheet, statement of earnings, comprehensive income or loss or cash flows. In addition, we determined that the adjustments are not material to our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole for any period. We also confirmed that these adjustments did not change the achievement levels under our incentive plans. Further details is included in the Form 10-K we filed this morning. Throughout this process, we have continued to operate the business and drive our strategic priorities forward. While our internal investigation is substantially complete, we continue to cooperate with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, and we hope you understand that we will not be taking questions related to these matters on the call today. We will provide updates on this matter in the future as appropriate. Please turn to Slide 4, where we have captured our fourth quarter and full year financial highlights. Today, ADM reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.36 and adjusted segment operating profit of $1.4 billion. Our full year adjusted earnings per share were $6.98, the second best EPS in our history, and our adjusted segment operating profit was $6.2 billion. Our trailing fourth quarter adjusted ROIC was 12.2%, making another year of ROIC performance above our 10% target. Our full year operating cash flow before working capital was $4.7 billion. Our strong cash flow and disciplined management of our balance sheet continues to allow us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. In total, we returned $3.7 billion to our shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases in 2023. In January, with the expectation of continued strong cash flows in 2024, we announced an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend, raising our dividend to $0.50 per share which marks 92 years of uninterrupted dividends and over 51 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. Today, we also announced that our Board has authorized the additional repurchase of up to $2 billion in shares in 2024 under ADM's existing share repurchase program. Our performance for 2023 shows the overall effectiveness of our strategy where our broad portfolio of business is combined to deliver resilient results for the year. Despite a more challenging operating environment, we maintained strong earnings and ROIC while delivering key strategic accomplishments across the enterprise. Next slide, please. To put our 2023 results into perspective, at the end of 2021, we provided the road map to create value and growth returns by getting closer to customers and highlighted where we expect it to perform on several important strategic metrics by 2025. As I look at our 2-year track record over these 2025 objectives, we have delivered adjusted earnings per share at the top end of our $6 to $7 per share EPS objective. We have also continued to deliver ROIC above our 10% target. Through our strong performance, we have been able to fund the strategic investments in our businesses while returning cash to shareholders. These strategic efforts and investments have positioned ADM even closer to the customer. Whether that connection is through our growing regenerator agriculture programs and partnerships, the growth of our renewable fuels partnerships as seen in our Green Bison JV with Marathon or the expansion of our Marshall, Minnesota starch facility to serve customer needs across food and industrial products. These investments and others like them not only support our current strategy, they will be the wase for our -- for us to break through the $6 to $7 per share EPS range as we move beyond 2025. Let's turn to Slide 6, which I summarize our priorities for value creation in 2024. We continue building a stronger company for the future. And to support this, we have identified 3 key priorities for 2024, 1, managing the cycle; 2, nutritional recovery and 3, enhanced return of cash to shareholders. Let's take a closer look at each of these areas of focus. We know that 2024 will be a more challenging year that we faced in 2022 and 2023. We see tailwinds that supported a portion of our performance over the past few years, changing direction, making our continued progress on our strategic metrics more reliant than ever on our productivity and innovation agenda. In 2024, we will continue to focus on those strategic initiatives that provide strong growth prospects. Our destination marketing efforts continue to bring us closer to our customers and enable us to serve them in a differentiated capacity, and we continue to expand. In 2023, we added 3 new offices across Asia and the Middle East. And in 2024, we plan to add 2 to 4 more. Through this ongoing expansion, we expect to achieve 6% growth in our destination marketing volumes. Direct farmer buying has been steadily increasing over the past several years and provides ADM, an opportunity to maximize value for both sides by creating efficiencies through working directly together. We plan to take this even further in 2024, leveraging our network of more than 200,000 farmer relationships to grow direct origination volumes year-over-year by about 10% and as our customers strive to decarbonize their own products and services, we are seeing a steady increase in the financial returns generated by our own decarbonization efforts. From Regen Ag partnerships to lowering the carbon footprint of our operations. The pace of this is accelerating as we move into 2024. Tied to these strategic initiatives, we continue to build capacity to serve growing customer demand. I mentioned earlier the opening of our Green Bison soy processing facility as well as the expansion of our Marshall, Minnesota starch facility. This capacity addition support growing demand for a wide variety of sustainable products and solutions from renewable fuels to industrial products. And connected to our productivity efforts, we have formally launched a 2024 program we call the drive for execution excellence within the organization. Over the years, we have consistently encouraged our ADM colleagues to identify and execute both cost saving and cash generation ideas. We've developed processes and systems through our prior transformation programs and now those are ramping up for another cycle. As part of this, we have already commissioned more than 300 projects and plan to see $500 million in traceable cost savings over the next 2 years across all aspects of our enterprise from operations to supply chain to corporate costs. Now let's discuss our plans within the Nutrition business. We're calling this section, of course, Nutrition recovery for a reason. Nutrition had a very difficult year with results well below our expectations, and we have been working aggressively to change this and return to growth. For Nutrition, 2023 representing a combination of challenging market forces, some specific nonrecurring events and some misses on demand fulfillment. And when market forces such as customer destocking as well as softer demand for plant-based proteins are not within our control. We're already taking action on the areas we can improve. Many of the supply issues are the result of the complexity built into the Nutrition business over time. In our zeal to meet our customers' needs, we have created one of the strongest pantries in the industry. This added complexity in our operations and supply chain that at times impacted our ability to efficiently fulfill demand. To address this, we have made important changes to drive simplification across the Nutrition business that will ease the pressure on our overall supply chain and dramatically improve our demand fulfillment performance. First, we have created a stronger division of duty across operations leadership and added new leaders with a strong expertise in supply chain management. We have also taken steps to build our COE expertise back into the core business, helping make our overall supply chain capabilities more agile and responsive to commercial demand signals. We have also engaged third-party experts to help identify further opportunities for operational excellence improvements across our largest facilities. We have also greatly simplified the product and production landscape to further achieve operational and supply efficiency, reducing the brands we are presenting to customers by 2/3 and downsizing about 17% of our SKUs, alongside the strategic production line simplification. A recent example of this is the closure of more than 20 Animal Nutrition production lines in 2023. Now better serving the product mix and supply chain efficiency of the business. We're also optimizing our Nutrition business portfolio. Leveraging our experience in both large-scale and bolt-on acquisitions, we have enhanced our approach to M&A integration to increase value creation as we focus more on the integration of recent acquisitions than new targets. We continue to assess our portfolio for strategic fit, making surgical decisions to achieve the returns target we expect. For example, during Q4, we took action on 2 JVs that were not expected to meet our returns criteria. We're proud to see how the team with new leadership has rallied around this recovery plan, which is already showing signs of improvement as we move through the first quarter of the year. Recent trends suggest that destocking impacts in beverages are subsiding, and we are well positioned to capture recovering demand in 2024 as evidenced by the strong demand we are seeing in flavors. After heightening our operational efficiency, we've seen a steady increases in shipping volumes and production throughout the course of the last month. And in Animal Nutrition, we have seen another quarter of sequential improvement in the base of the business, which excludes amino acid and pet solutions. And early indications in the first quarter of 2024 suggest that this will continue. Importantly, our nutrition value proposition continues to be well received by customers, as evidenced by our robust opportunity pipeline and industry-leading win rates across key categories like flavors, dietary supplements and pet. ADM's customer centricity and agile innovation capabilities supported through our creation, design and development expertise differentiates us. We continue to believe that Nutrition has an important role in ADM's integrated business model. Beyond adding value to the ingredients produced by our AS&O and carbohydrate solution businesses, Nutrition is innovating to address evolving consumer needs and is connecting us more closely with a growing customer base. Finally, I'll turn attention to the capital allocation strategy that continues to guide our strategic cash deployment decisions. As noted, we announced today that the Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion in shares through the remainder of the year, including $1 billion in shares to be executed through an accelerated share repurchase program as soon as practical. This will total $6.4 billion in repurchases executed since 2022 and coupled with the already announced 11% dividend growth. This is aligned with our commitment to a balanced capital allocation approach. So combined, we believe these 3 areas of focus set ADM to perform well in a challenging external operating environment in 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Ismael for more detail on the results of the operations. Ismael?"", 'Ismael Roig', ""Thank you, Juan. Let's start on Slide 7, which provides overall segment operating income and EPS for 2023. Overall, we delivered the second highest earnings in company history, overcoming a challenging operating environment. Adjusted segment operating profit was $6.2 billion for the full year, a 6% decrease versus the prior year. At a high level, operating profit was primarily down year-over-year in Ag Services and Oilseeds and Nutrition. In the other segment, which includes ADMIS and captive insurance, we had a significant increase in operating profit. Adjusted earnings per share were $6.98 for the year. Improved pricing in Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition as well as positive impacts from mark-to-market timing in AS&O more than offset the impact of lower crush margins, leading to a $0.70 per share improvement versus the prior year. Volume improvement in AS&O was more than offset by volume declines in Carbohydrate Solutions & Nutrition, resulting in a $0.29 per share reduction in EPS versus the prior year. Higher manufacturing costs partially related to unplanned downtime at the Decatur complex led to a $0.41 per share decrease versus the prior year. Lower equity earnings, primarily related to Wilmar, attributed a $0.46 per share decrease versus the prior year. Increased corporate costs related to higher interest rates and the One ADM implementation, partially offset by higher ADMIS results drove a $0.30 per share versus the prior year. For other, benefits from share repurchases were more than offset by negative impacts related to a higher adjusted income tax rate and cycling onetime benefits from the legal recovery and biofuel producer recovery program, leading to an $0.18 per share decrease versus the prior year. Moving to Slide 8. Let's look at our segment performance for AS&O. For the full year, AS&O delivered $4.1 billion in segment operating profit, 8% lower than the record level in 2022. Ag Services segment operating profit was 15% lower versus the prior year as reduced origination volume and margins in North America were partially offset by record South American origination volumes. In Global Trade, destabilization of trade flows led to lower results compared to an exceptional 2022. Crushing segment operating profit for the full year was $346 million lower versus the prior year as improved process volumes were more than offset by lower crush margins and higher manufacturing costs. Refined Products and Other results were $469 million higher, resulting in a record year. Results were driven by higher volumes and margins in biodiesel. Market volatility drove positive timing impacts of approximately $235 million compared to negative timing impacts of $90 million in the prior year. Equity earnings for Wilmar were $303 million in '23, approximately 45% lower than the prior year. Now let's move to Slide 9 and look at Carbohydrate Solutions. For the full year, Carbohydrate Solutions segment operating profit was $1.4 billion, 3% lower versus the record prior year. In the Starches and Sweeteners segment, higher pricing and mix were offset by weaker volumes and lower corn co-product values. The teams executed well in a dynamic environment, posting a record year in wheat milling. In Vantage Corn processing, strong exports and steady domestic demand and blending rates supported ethanol production and robust margins. The prior year also included onetime benefits of $50 million, related to the USDA Biofuel Producer Recovery Program. We also continue to make significant progress on our BioSolutions strategic initiative, delivering revenue growth well ahead of our 15% plus target.Please now turn to Slide 10. In Nutrition, revenues of $7.2 billion for the full year were 6% lower versus the prior year. Demand headwinds and destocking impacts, coupled with operational challenges related to the ERP systems integration pressured volumes. This more than offset price and mix benefits as well as positive currency impacts. In Human Nutrition, volumes declined due to lower market demand for plant-based proteins, destocking impacts in beverages and operational challenges related to the ERP system implementation. This was partially offset by improved price and mix and flavors and texturants pricing in Specialty Ingredients. In Animal Nutrition, lower complete feed and premix volumes, the normalization of amino acid markets and demand fulfillment challenges in pet solutions led to lower revenue versus 2022. Now please turn to Slide 11. For the full year, Nutrition segment operating profit was $427 million, 36% lower versus the prior year. Human Nutrition results of $417 million were 25% lower than the prior year as weaker volumes as well as increased costs related to operational challenges from the ERP implementation and unplanned the cater -- downtime at the catteries were partially offset by higher pricing. Animal Nutrition results of $10 million were 91% lower compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower volumes and the normalization of amino acid pricing. When bridging from 2022, our performance can be characterized in 3 buckets: market forces, onetime items and operational challenges. Market forces accounted for a majority of the deterioration in 2023 and as previously mentioned this was mostly related to lower demand and plant-based proteins, destocking impacts in beverages and lower premix and completed demand, which impacted volumes across the industry. Secondly, onetime items amounted to $64 million during the year, accounting for over 1/4 of the total segment decline in operating profit. $45 million of the onetime impacts was related to underperforming joint ventures in SAVAN and PlantPlus Foods. The remaining $19 million of the onetime impacts was related to investment valuation losses in health and wellness. Lastly, we also had our own operation struggles that impacted our ability to deliver on the strong demand that we have created. The implementation of ERP systems over the course of the year led to complications in shipping and production -- product -- producing products, negatively impacting both volumes and manufacturing costs. Over the past month, we have seen a steady improvement in operations and are confident that we will see volumes lost in '23 come back in '24. Now please turn to Slide 12. For the full year, other segment operating profit was $375 million, up 125% compared to the prior year. ADM Investor Services result improved on higher net interest income. Higher captive insurance results on new program premiums were partially offset by higher claim losses. In corporate, for the full year, net interest expense increased year-over-year on higher short-term interest rates. Unallocated corporate costs increased versus the prior year on higher global technology spend to support digital transformation efforts. Other corporate was unfavorable compared to the prior year due to onetime investment valuation losses of approximately $57 million.Please turn to Slide 13. Over the last 2 years, the company has generated significant cash flow that have bolstered our balance sheet and provided us with financial flexibility to drive long-term growth. In 2023, we again had strong cash flow of $4.7 billion, which were actualized in line with our balanced capital allocation framework. 30% or approximately $1.5 billion of cash flows were reinvested in the business to support growth and modernize our assets, including investments in new capacity and the digitization of our existing asset footprint. Our cash flows also supported significant capital return in 2023 with nearly 30% earnings going to dividends and nearly 60% of cash flows or about $2.7 billion going to shareholders via share repurchases. In 2024, we expect to hold capital expenditures to a level aligned with depreciation and amortization with focused spend around the safety and reliability of assets. We also intend to manage working capital needs prudently, limiting M&A beyond previously announced transactions and focusing our team on cost savings and cash generation initiatives through the drive for execution excellence. As Juan mentioned earlier, our priorities for cash deployment in 2024 will remain focused around the shareholder. We finished the year with strong momentum in terms of returning cash, and nearly 330 million of shares so far in Q1. Over the course of the year, we intend to actualize $2 billion of additional share repurchases with $1 billion being executed through an accelerated share repurchase program as soon as practical. Now let's transition to a discussion of guidance for 2024 on Slide 14, please. In 2024, global grain and oilseed supply is expected to increase as anticipated improvements in weather should support larger production levels in key South American countries. Assuming commodity prices ease for recent highs and trade flows adjust to the dislocations created over the past 2 years, we anticipate global soybean crush margins will moderate in 2024, likely moving into a range of $35 per metric ton to $60 per metric ton. From the demand side, we continue to expect vegetable oil demand growth from renewable diesel and low single-digit soybean meal demand growth to support structural margin improvement. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.25 per share to $6.25 per share representing an 18% decline from prior year at the midpoint. Now breaking down our expectations by segment for 2024. Let's turn to Slide 15. In AS&O, we anticipate the first quarter to be lower and the full year to also be lower versus comparable prior periods as increased global commodity supply and normalization of margins will weigh on the segment. We anticipate global soy crush margins within the range of $35 per metric ton to $60 per metric ton as the market balances better soybean availability against increased crush and renewable diesel capacity. Our operational excellence efforts and the ramp-up of our Green Bison facility should lead to mid- to high single-digit improvement in our process volumes. We expect significantly lower biodiesel margins in 2023 timing gains to reverse as contracts are executed. In Carbohydrate Solutions, we anticipate the first quarter to be lower versus the prior year. For the full year, we anticipate another strong year, but slightly lower than 2023 as the improved volumes and margins in sweeteners and starches could be offset by weaker ethanol. For nutrition, the first quarter is expected to be lower versus the prior year as we faced headwinds from a normalizing texturants market, fixed costs associated with operational challenges related to the Decatur East and protein volumes. However, for the full year, we expect Nutrition to begin its path to recovery. We anticipate conversion of our significant pipeline opportunities in Human and Animal Nutrition to yield mid-single-digit revenue growth. We assume market normalization in texturants to be a headwind in '24. We do not anticipate a significant onetime events of 2023 to recur. Back to Juan."", 'Juan Ricardo Luciano', ""Thank you, Ismael. Please turn to Slide 16. In summary, let me once again share the 3 priorities for our year ahead. We will continue our efforts across the business to drive our productivity and innovation portfolio of projects, taking advantage of capacity gains we have made and ensure that our teams are generating and executing on our drive for execution excellence. We continue to take aggressive actions in the Nutrition business to ensure that it can deliver on the areas of growth that we have continued to build into our opportunity pipeline. This includes supporting the operational changes we have introduced, driving simplification through our products and brands and ensuring that our business portfolio is tuned to best achieve our return expectations. And we're also actively managing our balanced capital allocation strategy, both prudently investing in the business while growing our dividends and accelerating our share repurchase program to return more to shareholders in the near term. I believe strongly in the powerful role ADM plays as a leader in the agricultural supply chain and that our ability to bring partners together across the value chain will be critical to driving future transformation in the food, feed, fuel and industrial markets we serve. I want to express my gratitude to the ADM team for their dedication, hard work and resourcefulness. I'm confident in our ability to deliver solid results as we move into 2024 and continue to pay a path for long-term profit growth. Operator, please open the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.', 'Adam Samuelson', ""I guess my question is really around framing the go-forward outlook in terms of the cyclical versus the pieces that ADM controls. And you had the targets in the 2021 Investor Day still on the slides of returns and earnings per share. The outperformance in the last couple of years has been largely cyclically driven in AS&O, whereas some of the investments and the items under your own control, particularly Nutrition have not performed up to expectations. As we think about '24, that's at least the cyclical parts are reversing, at least in part. Can you want to put a little bit more finer point on how you think about 2024 versus normalized earnings for the business? And maybe quantify the path forward in Nutrition beyond this year as you work to earn a return on the substantial investments you've actually made in that business?"", 'Juan Ricardo Luciano', ""Thank you, Alan. So let's take the businesses -- each of the businesses in the portfolio. So when we think about Ag Services and Oil Seeds, as you said, we had spectacular performance over the last couple of years taking full advantage of the opportunities in the market. But we forecasted in 2021 that margins were going to moderate although they were going to stay higher than historical averages, and we are seeing that. We see the moderation, and we see even crush margins 35% to 60% that we are forecasting are higher than average. We have not stayed quiet, waiting for the cycle to reverse. We have been adjusting our business model. You heard me saying about destination marketing, something we didn't have a few years ago and we continue to grow that. That gives us extra margins. And now we are forecasting that we continue to expand, and we're going to grow those volumes 6% this year. And that program continue as we expand into new geographies in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. When you think also about the Regen program -- Regen Ag program that we have with our customers, we are helping our CPG customers with their Scope 3 emissions. And we're working together with the farmers and that program is the leading program in the industry and continues to grow. We are also doing everything in the value chain. We're looking at farmer direct that's an ability for us to get efficiencies between us and the producer, the way we buy grain. So of course, we get an advantage with that as the producer as well. And we're planning to increase our volumes 10%, leveraging on the 200,000 farmer relationships we have around the world. Of course, we have expanded capacity. We are expanding crush in Latin America. We are expanding crush in North America with Spiritwood. So I would say, when you take that plus our operational improvements, if you will, what we call the push for excellence, that was going to be the productivity and innovation agenda that we're going to help us navigate through this. We see '24 still as a strong year for Ag Services and also is going to be lower, but is still going to be a strong year. Of course, the market has price a lot of the extra capacity and the higher Argentine crop into the crush margins, but we still see the ability of the market to absorb all that capacity with a strong mill growth and with a strong demand for oil. So that's on the Ag Services and Oilseeds side. On the Carb Solutions side, this business has been very stable over the last few years. It has had a very good '22 and '23. We are expecting a very good 2024, maybe slightly lower, but it's still very, very good. We had a good program for a good contract renewals in 2024. We had -- we are happy with the margins. We have maintained margins for the most part, and we have gained some volumes. So volumes are strong. The milling business has been going, had a record year last year, and it continues to drive very strong. I think both business has a little bit of a lower contribution from feed products where margins have decreased a little bit. But Biosolutions, as Ismael mentioned, continues to grow, it's growing beyond 15% per year. And all the decarbonization things that we're saying, we see more and more demand for everything that card solutions can bring to the table in that area. So we feel very good about that. Always the question mark in the year maybe is ethanol. But we're seeing right now, Adam, ethanol -- the arbitrage to exports from the U.S. is open to everywhere in the world. So it's just a matter of adjusting our capacity and the U.S. capacity to get more dehydrated ethanol, if you will, to be able to export to adjust the humidity content, if you will. So I think with export well north of maybe 1.5 million, 1.6 billion gallons for this year that should bode well for recovery of margins as we go into the year. And then you take Nutrition. Nutrition has been a growth story for many years, and we certainly stumble in 2023. I mentioned some of the reasons -- some of the reasons where there was a big destocking after all the COVID and all the supply chain issues that the industry had, the industry stopped, and now we went through lower inflation and destocking about that. So we had to go that in beverages, which is -- which drives flavors, which is our biggest engine for growth, if you will. Of course, we knew into the year that plant-based proteins, we have moderated our expectations for growth on that. We'll still grow, but it's not going to be beyond 10%. So there is still going to be an attractive mid-single-digit growth, if you will. We knew that. And then we had continued good demand in Pet and Health and Wellness and Animal Nutrition has been improving their P&L, doing a lot of self-help from -- the June P&L has been improving all the year. So unfortunately, we get to the Q4, and we had several events in Q4. We have several one-offs we needed to take action on a couple of joint ventures, and we addressed that. We needed to take a revaluation of an investment because of the yen devaluation and we took that in the Q4 and then we have some issues on our own performance that we needed to implement One ADM, but as much as we prepare for that. We had some problems with some of the modules. It was a successful implementation, but some of the modules were about shipping products gave us trouble during the last quarter of the year. So when you have all that combination, it gave us a very bad quarter. We continue to see 2024 a year of growth for -- or recovery, if you will from the 2023 value. And from there, we should continue to march on our commitment to nutrition, our ability to fulfill or to deliver the value proposition that resonates with customers continue to be evidenced by our growing pipeline, both in Animal and Human Nutrition. And our conversion rate, we have benchmarked this is industry-leading conversion rate. So we know we are winning. We need to adjust our own internal processes to make sure we deliver that. And we have done that heavily in the last -- second half of last year, and we have seen that during January and February that we are delivering much better than we did last year. So with that, I still look confident at the numbers and the overall number for the company that we gave you for 2025. As I said at the onset, we are ahead and what we schedule from an EPS perspective, we are above 10% in ROIC, and we have purchased already more than the $5 billion of share that we have estimated for 2025. So it's never going to be a straight line from here to 2025, but we have a resilient portfolio that can help us see that those numbers for the overall portfolio are still positive -- possible as it was in December '21. Sorry for the long answer. It's a large company."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Tom Palmer of Citi.', 'Thomas Hinsdale Palmer', ""I wanted to dig in a bit more on crush margins and your $35 to $60 global soybean crush outlook. Maybe just to frame it, where were global crush margins last year, where are crush margins currently when we consider different regions of the world? And then as we think about the items that could drive to the upper or lower end of this year's range, what are kind of the key items you're looking at?"", 'Juan Ricardo Luciano', ""Thank you, Tom. So as we said before, Ismael mentioned in his remarks, we expect crush margins between $35 and $60 for this year, they were about $70 per ton maybe last year. I think it's fair to say that the market has completely priced or baked all the bad news into the crush margins that we have in today. So I would say, board crush has moved significantly lower in the last month as the market probably gained more confidence in the availability of products, especially soybean meal, particularly when you think about Argentina now having sites on a crop that may be 50 million tons and the U.S. crush industry also has performed very well. And the market continue to look forward to the second quarter of the year when they're going to have basically 3 offers for mill that hasn't happened last year. So if you remember last year, after Brazil finishing export in the U.S. became the only global -- only game in town, if you will. And that increased soybean meal values around the world, which makes soybean meal expensive, if you will, for the ration. We see that in the U.S. we saw, at least for ADM, we saw 5 consecutive months of record exports for soybean meal in the U.S. and the U.S. industry. So similar situation. So now with the correction in this, we expect that soybean meal will gain back into the rations. Of course, feeding without -- with [meat pros] and not soybean meal, it's not the optimal way to feed. So now that soybean meal has corrected, we expect that to happen. At the end of the day, Tom, the way I think about where crush is going to happen in the world is going to happen in both places where you have been availability and where you have a domestic oil market. If you think of Brazil, Brazil is having B14 started in March, and that has helped with the margins of domestic oil for us in Brazil. And of course, you have a big crop. So you're going to have the bean availability and the domestic market. And then it will be the U.S. in which you have all the need of soybean oil to go into renewable green diesel and biodiesel. And we have, of course, bean availability. So we think that crush will favor those 2 places."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik of BMO.', 'Andrew Strelzik', ""I guess, ultimately, my question is about 2025 and whether you view 2024 as kind of the trough year from an earnings perspective in terms of the cycle? And if I just follow up on maybe you made some comments at the end of the response to Adam about 2025, I didn't know if that was specific to the metrics around Nutrition or the prior earnings guidance that you had talked about. If you could just kind of clarify the way that you're thinking about that. Is this 2024 an earnings number from which you would expect to grow? And then the 2025 comments with that."", 'Juan Ricardo Luciano', ""Yes, Andrew. Yes, first of all, my comment before to Tom's question was the overall number that we gave for the company for 2025 in 2021, we still believe that number is there. I think that, that number was never going to be a destination for ADM, was a milestone, if you will. And as we are reviewing our 5-year plan that we do every year, we see us breaking through that number. So in that sense, I expect 2024 to be a down year versus 2023, hopefully, 2025 will be a positive year versus 2024. There is a cycle here that needs to happen, Andrew, that I describe below. Soybean meal will get cheaper. .All the oil activities related to B14 or RGD needs to grow. All that needs to happen and how long that adjustment takes, how long it takes for meal to be low enough to increase demand. And for flat prices to be low enough to maybe make the farmer correct a little bit their planting and all that process we know historically happens. When exactly it's going to happen, does it happen in the calendar year, does it happen in 6 months, does it happen in a year is hard to say. But we continue to build a company that have more optionality, that's more resilience for the future. So as the cycle moderates, we continue to have more ability to bring more to the P&L. So we think with that, I'm optimistic about '25 being better than '24."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens.', 'Benjamin Shelton Bienvenu', 'I want to ask as we think about 2024 for the Nutrition segment. You noted that you expect mid-single-digit revenue growth, operating profit to be higher over a year. I think the natural inference would be that the operating profit growth is up by less than 5% or mid-single-digit revenue growth. Is that true? And then as you referenced kind of the cadence in your expectations for the first quarter, this is a trajectory of recovery that will build throughout the year in 2024. You talk about pipeline conversion. Are there residual headwinds discontinuities from the Decatur complex still in the first quarter? Help us think through the sequencing of the development of return to growth in Nutrition.', 'Juan Ricardo Luciano', ""Yes. Good question, Ben. Let me give you the puts and takes, if you will, on Nutrition, as we look at 2024. So as Ismael said in his remarks, about half of the headwinds that we faced last year were market. That means that half of them were in the other 2 buckets, the nonrecurring events, if you will. And those by nature, we hope that we're not going to have going forward. And then -- and I think Ismael qualify them about $60-something million, give or take, and then the other ones were like some of the demand fulfillment issues that I explained how we have worked aggressively to correct, and we have seen good indication of that over the first 2 months of this year. So I would say those are the positive that we don't expect all that to happen again in 2024. You put on top of that a single-digit revenue growth -- mid-single-digit revenue growth because of the pipeline that we have and the conversion of that pipeline and that tends to happen every year. Then as you described, we have to -- we have to face a correction of texturizing prices that were exceptionally high last year. We're not going to have that. So that will be part of the negative side, if you will. And certainly, as we go through the year, we still need to bring the Decatur plant back into operations. And that we have -- that will have a tail of the cost. So I would say the year will be driven by a strong recovery in Animal Nutrition, in flavors and hopefully, Pet with some tailwinds in the Specialty Ingredients. That's how we see."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays.', 'Benjamin M. Theurer', ""I wanted to follow up on Carbohydrate Solutions because that obviously as you've highlighted, has been a very solid performer last year. Even the outlook looks very promising still in comparison to maybe some of the other segments for 2024. And I wanted to understand where you are within your different asset bases, be it on the ethanol side, but also particularly starches and sweeteners to -- for the need to invest into the business. Where are you in terms of capacity and what do you need to potentially allocate money to in order to keep that business up where it is or potentially further grow it as it has gained significance within the consolidated ADM results?"", 'Juan Ricardo Luciano', ""Yes, Ben I'm glad you're highlighting Carb Solutions. They had a spectacular year. They deserve recognition. And they've done a fantastic job of transforming their business into a very resilient and stable business. The assets, let me take it by pieces. The milling business, milling is an old business. So that has some old assets and over the last few years, we have been doing -- the team has been doing a terrific job of shutting down some assets and consolidating those in new facilities like Mendota that we launched last year, that is the best and the newest with milling plant in the world. So we are happy with the way they have done that, they continue to do so. So that business is in good shape. When we look at the wet mills, we continue to invest in part of the wet mill, unlikely that we're going to build a new wet mill, as you can understand, but business continues to be reinvested in, is a business that is a large business, has a large asset footprint. And at the moment, there is a lot of capital being associated with the path to decarbonize all these assets. So as you heard, we have a lot of efforts in trying to get pipelines, to try to monetize some of our CO2 that come from the biogenic CO2 that comes from the ethanol plant. So -- and I would say we have expanded Marshall because Biosolutions is growing at north of 15% per year. So we needed capacity. So the Marshall expansion is about 50% expansion to the final starch capacity that we have there and that will help a lot with that. I would say the year is exciting as it is developing. It has solid margins. It has so far solid volumes. It had a little bit of a rough January because of the bad weather. We have ice in the plants and freezing weather and -- but February, March things look good. And we think that, that business has the opportunity to get some tailwinds from lower energy costs and maybe chemicals cost as the year go by and that's a big energy hog, that business. So that could be an advantage and a tailwind coming later in the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Manav Gupta of UBS.', 'Manav Gupta', ""I just had a quick question. When we look at the Carb recent proposals and then we look at the 45Z, it looks both at the federal level and at some state levels, there is a desire to lower the amount of renewable diesel being produced from vegetable oil, and I'm just trying to understand, do you see that as some kind of a headwind whereby eventually, the demand for soybean oil from the renewable diesel or biodiesel industry would actually decline versus what we are seeing? Or you think this is just passing and the demand eventually will rise again as we move along."", 'Juan Ricardo Luciano', 'Thank you, Manav, for the question. Listen, I think the path is clear for RGD, that RGD will need vegetable oils. When you think about how Europe is doing? Europe not having a (inaudible) that. Europe needs cooking oil, waste oils and they will capture that. The U.S. will have to be fed with soybean oil, canola oil, and we see that commitment to be firm over the years. All these capacity is being built, it cannot be filled with anything else. So we feel that is a strong trend ahead of us.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Salvator Tiano of Bank of America.', 'Salvator Tiano', 'I just want to go back to the 2025 target of $6 to $7 in EPS. I mean that is obviously double-digit EPS growth and understand buybacks play a role into that. But given the comments about controllables versus cyclicals, it seems really past your margin getting back there. Can you provide a little bit some of the key components and key buckets that you think will get you there in terms of each segment and specific numbers as detailed as possible?', 'Juan Ricardo Luciano', ""Yes, Salvator. A little bit of what I explained early on, on Alan's question. I think that we will see how the cycle plays in AS&O. As I said, I think that lower prices have this ability to incentivate demand. At this point in time, if you think about soybean meal demand, we are forecasting a very strong soybean meal demand, maybe higher than USDA levels, higher than GDP. When you think about Southeast Asian economy is recovering and with inflation moderating, purchasing power is improving, tourism is improving in all those areas. You have, at the moment, very high prices of beef that's favoring pork and chicken. You have protein -- protein margin for chicken being better at that. .So we think that soybean meal will gain in the ration. So when we look at all that, we see the soy oil demand very strong in domestic consumption, but also for biofuels. And then we see the meal demand very strong. We think that this correction should be probably short term for crush and that should come back. Again, I cannot make a prediction on the timing of that, but we know how the cycle plays. So whether it's calendar year this or 6 months later or a quarter earlier, I mean, it's not for me to venture into those guesses. I think that Carb Solutions between the exceptional job they are doing and managing their mature businesses and the growth that they are getting through decarbonization and BioSolutions you will see that ahead of us. Again, we just bring in the Marshall expansion. That's not something that it was in our forecast last year. So we're going to have it more in the next 3 quarters, if you will, of the year. Spiritwood, again, and some of the crush capacity we brought in Brazil. And then you see Nutrition that Nutrition was not a contributor, certainly a big contributor to growth in 2023, but we expect it to be back to growth in 2024 and 2025. So those are kind of the buckets, if you will, that I see at the moment."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Steven Haynes of Morgan Stanley.', 'Steven Kyle Haynes', 'Maybe just to come back to Nutrition. I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about some portfolio refreshment going on there. And I was wondering if you could maybe size the scope of that. Are you thinking more kind of product line oriented here? Or is this kind of more at the business level where you might be looking to monetize something.', 'Juan Ricardo Luciano', ""Yes, Stephen. Listen, let me give you my thinking on that and the way we approach these things. So we're always looking -- every time we do our 5-year plan, we take a look at those units that whether they are not returning -- given our return expectations today, we're not forecasting it to do it in the medium term. And those are the ones that we tend to take action. So we took action with a couple of joint ventures, as I mentioned. And then we look at every unit that is underperformed. What we do first is we try to bring them to performance. So we make sure that if there are some things that are self-inflicted, if you will, we correct those things. Once we correct those things and then we have visibility to what could happen over the next 2 or 3 years, then we decide as a part of portfolio, whether they belong in nutrition or they belong in another part of ADM or they belong outside ADM. So that's a regular process we've done. We've done it in the past with fertilizers in Latin America. We've done it in the past. We divested Bolivia, we divested cocoa and chocolate. So we've done this, and now we've done it with a couple of joint ventures. We've done it -- also Ismael has done in his previous job as an animal nutrition leader with some of the lines in Animal Nutrition that we cut like 20 lines around the world. So sometimes, we have exited countries. So it's a regular process that at times, maybe when you have a stumble like we had in Nutrition, you look a little bit deeper because now all of a sudden you have more businesses at lower performance. So we really want to see is it worth investing in some of those. So we're in that process. So nothing to announce today, but we continue to look at that very deeply."", 'Ismael Roig', ""Just a couple of complementary comments because not only have we had some experience historically, as Juan correctly mentioned with coca and fertilizer. But certainly, the Animal Nutrition was a good precursor to some of the thinking that we have now in mind for the whole of our Nutrition business in the sense that usually when you acquire these businesses, they come with footprint allocations, labs, farms in our cases and warehouses that when you aggregate them, start aggregate them across a number of different acquisitions, you realize that they're overlaps. And what we noticed is that there was a significant opportunity in Animal Nutrition to significantly simplify the portfolio by reducing the number of labs, reducing the number of SKUs of plants. And we've seen those benefits they've been occurring since the second half of 2023. And I think some of that thinking as we have built this organization by a multiplicity of acquisitions lend itself now to a pause and reflection in light of the successes that we've had with this to apply it more broadly to all of the portfolio. So that's where our capital prudence is going to come in by focusing on ensuring that we improve our asset base while returning cash to our shareholders."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Dushyant Ailani of Jefferies.', 'Dushyant Ajit Ailani', 'I just wanted to quickly talk about biodiesel margins and going forward your thoughts there -- just around the system, both in the U.S. and internationally, just how do we frame our thoughts around that and capacity as well?', 'Juan Ricardo Luciano', ""Thank you Dushyant. Well, oil used for biofuel production is, as I said, is expected to grow in Brazil. We're going to go to B14. So there are many countries that are increasing their mandates, whether it's Indonesia and all that. When you look at the overall balances around the world, you see plantations in Southeast Asia getting older, the trees getting older, so maybe less production of palm oil. So you're going to see biodiesel mandates increasing around the world and less competitive pressure, if you will, for palm oil. So you're going to see the pressure on vegetable oil. So we think that, that will continue to be a strong leg of the crush. Biodiesel, in particular, biodiesel margins are better right now for us in Europe. They have moderated significantly in the U.S. and I will -- we expect them to be good, but not as good as they used to be in the U.S. So there will be a little bit of a headwind for us in 2024, but margins are better in Brazil and in Europe."", 'Operator', ""With that, we have no further questions. So I'll hand back to the management team for any closing remarks."", 'Megan Britt', 'Thank you for joining us today. Please feel free to follow up with me if you have any other questions.

(NYSE:HCA) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.66 on the 29th of March, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 0.8%."", ' Check out our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare ', 'It would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. Before making this announcement, HCA Healthcare was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.', 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 32.1% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 11% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.', ""HCA Healthcare has been paying dividends for a while, but the track record isn't stellar. This suggests that the dividend might not be the most reliable. The annual payment during the last 6 years was $1.40 in 2018, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.64. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 11% over that duration. Dividends have grown rapidly over this time, but with cuts in the past we are not certain that this stock will be a reliable source of income in the future."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. It's encouraging to see that HCA Healthcare has been growing its earnings per share at 13% a year over the past five years. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting."", 'Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that HCA Healthcare is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.', ""Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out 2 warning signs for HCA Healthcare that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

I will tell you all about that in a few minutes.This combination of healthy market dynamics, progress with our business fundamentals and exceeding our objectives is providing our team with the energy and the confidence to further advance our business.So with all this in mind, when I decided to join the company, it was because of bio Ventas's, diverse market-leading portfolio and the prospect to create significant shareholder value. And I feel even stronger about the potential about Ventas today than I did two months ago. And there are so many challenges for us to tackle, but we will approach it every day with a continuous improvement mindset, and we cannot wait to show everyone what Bioventus can and will achieve our I please allow me to transition and highlight the three areas we will prioritize in 2020 for, first, accelerating our revenue growth, second, improving our operational efficiency and boosting our future profitability, and third, improving our cash flow and liquidity position.Let me provide further context on these three areas. First, as we have discussed in the past 2024 will be the 2nd year of our planned turnaround with a focus on accelerating revenue growth across our business, fueled by increasing growth across our HA and Surgical Solutions businesses, along with continued above market growth in our international segments. Across each business, we are going to focus on improving our basic commercial fundamentals to drive stronger execution. With respect to our HA business, we expect volume growth to remain above market as we leverage the clinical differentiation of Darling, along with the shift from multiple injection therapy to single-injection therapy. And we expect that our strong volume growth, combined with improving price dynamics will accelerate revenue as the headwinds from the past year and a half subside throughout the year.Regarding surgical solutions, we see growth accelerating for this business as well. We expect the market-leading technology of our ultrasonics platform to continue to produce double digit growth. Meanwhile, the work done by the team to strengthen our bone graft substitutes business enabled us to return to above-market growth in the fourth quarter, which we expect to maintain in 2024. And we have a tremendous opportunity to build our international business with expected strong double digit growth. So overall, our financial plan calls for a meaningful increase in our revenue growth compared to the last two years.Second focus area improving our operational efficiency and boosting our future profitability through better prioritization, greater organizational efficiency and reductions in our operational expenditures. Regarding prioritization with many different growth opportunities in front of us, it's important for us to be very disciplined in prioritizing and funding initiatives that deliver sustainable value to our shareholders. Over the past two months, we've made progress with driving more disciplined, strategic focus and reducing our top business priorities now and start to reallocate our resources to maximize the return on our investments.With respect to organizational efficiency, we're a diverse company that has evolved through several acquisitions. And while our organization demonstrates fantastic teamwork daily, it's clear we have a significant opportunity to better integrate our business processes across functions and locations to streamline our work and drive speed so that it's easier for our customers to do business with us and so that we can devote more of our energy to generating profitable growth with this in mind improving our organizational efficiency is a key priority. And regarding our operational expenditures and the team captured material savings last year, and we'll continue to examine areas where we can reduce our expenses to either invest in more productive initiatives or to drop these savings to our bottom line to accelerate our margin expansion.As mentioned, our third major focus area is improving our cash flow and liquidity position as you're driving improved cash flow as a metric, my leadership team and I have as part of our incentive compensation, we expect to see a material change in our operating cash flow this year by lowering costs related to our acquisition integrations and debt restructuring. We also plan to drive a reduction in inventories in the second half of the year to further augment our cash flow.With respect to our liquidity position, we reduced our leverage over this past year by more than a full turn of EBITDA but it remains above our target range. An amendment to our term loan was an important step in providing flexibility through next year. Our improved cash generation enables us to reduce our debt throughout the year with the expectation that our leverage is below four turns by year end.All right. That concludes my remarks about my initial impressions at our priorities for the year. Before turning it over to Mark, let me just add and I'm going to dive deeper into our financials. Let me just say again how excited I am to be leading Bioventus. While significant work remains, I'm encouraged by our ability to address last year's headwinds and improve our financial results and liquidity. And now over the coming quarters, we will focus on steadily improving our business fundamentals and our performance as we work to build your confidence. And Bioventus, I'll turn the call over to Mark."", 'Mark Singleton', ""Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying I am proud of our entire organization for the significant improvement across our commercial business and functions. Not only have we solidified our financial position by driving a sizable growth in our adjusted EBITDA through a reduction in our cost structure, which enabled us to remove our going concern disclosure. We have delivered enhancements to our internal control environment and remediating our material weaknesses. Traditionally, the visibility into our business and coordination across our teams has significantly advanced, enabling us to have confidence as we execute our financial plan for 2020. For moving forward, we must consistently approach our business with a continuous improvement mindset to drive further efficiency across Bioventus.Now turning to our results for the fourth quarter revenue of $135 million came in above our expectations and represented growth of 8% higher compared to the prior year. Adjusting for the divestiture of our Wound business revenue growth increased 14% when compared to the prior year. In addition, adjusted EBITDA of $22 million increased $5 million when compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by the increase in revenue across pain treatments. Revenue growth accelerated as sales increased 23% compared to the prior year as we maintained our strong double digit volume growth driven by growing unit volumes were higher for both supermarkets and Johnson as well.We saw favorable pricing driven by last year's catch-up and rebates, which provided a favorable comparison revenue for the fourth quarter finished above our expectations due to higher volume, along with growth, lower rebate accruals. Looking ahead, we expect to sustain above-market volume growth given the clinical advantage of Dura-Line combined with the continued shift to a single objective injection therapy. From a pricing standpoint, there has been no change in our expectations from last quarter's earnings calls. We anticipate some headwinds through at least the first half of the year, but expect to see sequential improvement as we move throughout the year.Overall, we see revenue growth in 2024 to be mid to high single digits. Surgical Solutions revenue growth accelerated as we grew 12% and ultrasonics maintained double digit growth. Both was sponsor term higher than adjusted anticipated generator sales at the end of the year. Additionally, bone graft substitutes grew high-single digits as volume from the new distributor relationships added in the previous two quarters, ramped ahead of our expectations.In addition to the structural changes to our BGS selling efforts announced last quarter to drive dedicated focus on ultrasonics and VGS. helped to minimize distributor turnover moving forward, we remain excited about the momentum in ultrasonics, giving our leading technology, a small market share. This view is reinforced from the recent feedback from customers who refer to our ultrasonics portfolio as revolutionary when Dr. Robin, I spent time in the field earlier this year. Additionally, given the recent changes, BBTS., we feel the business is poised to return to more consistent growth in 2024. Combined, we expect our Surgical Solutions business to grow between high single to double digits in 2024.Shifting to our Restorative Therapies. Sales fell 16%, driven by the impact of our Wound business divestiture, which accounted for 20 percentage points of the decline. On an organic basis, restorative therapies increased four percentage points. Growth was driven by Exogen where we continue to see improved stabilization as revenue in the U. S, maintain and sequential growth. Excluding the impact of our own divestiture, we anticipate low single-digit growth in 2024 for restorative therapies.Finally, as we previewed on our earnings call last quarter, our international segment fell 4% with constant currency growth, down 6% for the year. Our international segment grew 10% and it is expected to maintain double digit growth in 2024. Growth was impacted by a prior year comparison for above-normal volume as back orders were filled for products in advanced rehabilitation. Partially offsetting this headwind was continued strength across our Surgical Solutions business.Moving down the income statement, adjusted gross margin of 71% increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Gross margin came in below our expectations due to transitory inventory write-offs. Overall, adjusted total operating expenses were at a similar level compared to the prior year. The expense reductions resulting from our restructuring and wind business divestiture were offset by higher commissions related to revenue growth this year and employee incentives, which were not accrued in the prior year.Now turning to our bottom line financial metrics. Adjusted operating income increased to $20 million from $13 million in the prior year, while adjusted net income totaled $6 million compared to a loss of $6 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.07 for the quarter compared to a loss of $0.02 in the prior year. Now for a brief recap of our full year results. Net sales of $512 million or even compared to 2022. Organic sales increased 4%, while adjusting for the impact of our wind divestiture for the year, adjusted EBITDA totaled $89 million and represented a 30% increase compared to the prior year. Adjusted gross margin for the year was 74% compared to 75% a year ago.Our 2023 adjusted gross margin reflects the impact of lower average selling price for the year in our AJ. franchise. Adjusted operating income for the year totaled $81 million compared to $51 million in 2022. Lower operating expenses from our focus throughout the year on reducing spending and benefits from our restructuring drove the increase.Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with $37 million of cash on hand and $395 million of debt outstanding. We had $18 million drawn on our revolving credit facility at the end of the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow represented an inflow of $10 million as higher net income drove the improvement compared to the prior year.From a liquidity perspective, our adjusted EBITDA for 2023 exceeded our expectations and we are well within compliance with our leverage and interest coverage covenants at the end of the fourth quarter. Additionally, we recently engaged our banking partners and amended our credit agreement to provide additional headroom in our leverage and interest coverage covenants through the third quarter of 2025 without impacting the spread of our term loan. As we project forward, we anticipate cash flow in 2024 to be significantly higher than 2023 and allow us to pay the amortization on our term loan. With the reduction in debt. We forecast our net leverage to be below four times by the end of the year.Finally, let me lay out our 2024 financial guidance based on current trends in our business, we expect net sales to be in a range of $520 million to $535 million for the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $89 million and $94 million. And finally, our guidance for adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.12 to $0.20. Similar to prior years, we expect our first quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be the lowest for the year in the fourth quarter to be the highest for the year with the second and third quarters looking fairly similar. Contributing to the acceleration in EBIT. Ebitda and earnings throughout the year will be a fairly consistent level of operating expenses each quarter.In closing, the execution of our business plan the past year has significantly strengthened our liquidity position and with our improved processes and controls, our visibility into our business has increased, leading to what we believe will be improved predictability. As we start the new year, we plan to enhance our revenue growth and cash flow while we maintain spending discipline.Operator, please open the line for questions."", 'Operator', ""We will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question. You may press star then one on your touchtone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset.

At this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our Our first question today comes from Chase Knickerbocker with Craig Hallum Capital. Please go ahead."", 'Chase Knickerbocker', ""Good morning, guys. Congrats on the results. Some pretty impressive results relative to expectations, certainly And welcome, Rob Maybe the first one for you on, you know, as you kind of looked at opportunities, what kind of sealed the deal for Bioventus, particularly with kind of the situation that we're in now kind of you being able to kind of continue this turnaround that certainly started and showed up in Q4 results."", 'Robert Claypoole', ""Maybe kind of go into a little bit more color there and then chase, looking forward to meeting, you said there were a few factors. I touched on them upfront, but I was looking at different opportunities that you have by Ventas is in large growing market segments. We have excellent world-class technology and favorable share positions and customers who understand our value and you don't want them out in the field with markup it's not just that our customers understand the benefits of our technology for their patients and for them, but also the reasons behind that and get a real feel for until after I joined, but I was familiar with the technology for and that combination of the market segments we're in the technology and the favorable share positions really spoke to the potential of the Company.And then when talking to the Board and the management team, it was clear to me that some of the headwinds that the company had faced were temporary and with the right focus, particularly with commercial execution and operational excellence that there was potential significant potential to drive shareholder value. So those are some of the reasons that made it a really attractive move from a Chase."", 'Chase Knickerbocker', 'Yes, makes sense. And maybe digging in a little bit more on pain on the drilling side, growth on a volume perspective continues to be pretty strong year over year. And our checks on as we start to see ASPs approved improved sequentially, kind of talk through the kind of the drivers of above market volume growth and kind of being able to have that above market volume growth off of some pretty tough comps from a volume growth perspective in 2023?', 'Mark Singleton', ""Yes, Chase, this is Mark. I'm sure the question will be again, talk about drilling. I mean, we take the first three quarters really continue the momentum into fourth Q through the clinical differentiation that we have in that product. I think also the market is moving to a single injection.And so we're favorable there with our clinical leverage differentiation as the market moves. And as we've talked about before, as well. We have a really strong contract position with several UnitedHealth with with Aetna and Cigna. Some of these contracts have come into play in 2023 that drove a lot of the growth and will be a comparison for us in 2024. But one strong contract position that we have is really driving a lot of the volume growth but what we're also executing really well on with our sales team is the pull through around those contracts and we got the contracts in place and really the sales team on really what have we got to give a shout out to them and they're really doing a great job of executing around these contracts and pulling in the other volume, more profitable volume around the contracts that are really having us hit that."", 'Chase Knickerbocker', ""And we expect that to continue and into 2024 and with us, pull pull through is much more profitable and then maybe how should we think about volume growth for Joelsson from this year as you kind of talked about there? Is that kind of headwind as things continue to transition to single injection products.And then just lastly for Rob, and if we think about that kind of that transition that we kind of talked about last quarter, bringing bone graft substitutes back to distributors largely at least that being the focus.Rob, do you think that that's, you know, the Q4 results kind of prove it that's kind of the right structure of the sales force ultrasonics to the internal field reps and kind of leveraging relationships from distributors on the bone graft side. And maybe we are harvesting more modest synergies between the two Yes, Jason, I'll take the first one on just on them yet."", 'Mark Singleton', ""And I think we continue to expect to drive growth in 2024 on Johnson as well. I mean, the market is moving the drilling, which is we're going to where we have a favorable contract position. But that doesn't mean that yields are going to decline. I think we're well positioned well that we know obviously, it's a low price point, but we're continuing to to have success in driving volume there as well."", 'Robert Claypoole', ""Yes, Chase, on the bone graft substitute side, of our our volume accelerated ahead of our expectations. And in part that's due to the change that we made and the reduction in distributor turnover. So we feel good about that change and overtime, we're going to scale the Surgical Solutions business with some infrastructure that we put in place."", 'Chase Knickerbocker', 'Great. Thanks for the questions. And again, congrats on a great quarter.', 'Mark Singleton', 'Thanks.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Robert Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.', ""Hi. This is actually Lili on for Robbie and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just on guidance on revenue and EBITDA guidance came in better than what the Street was thinking, but EPS fell short. So can you talk about any dynamics below the line that might be driving that shortfall? And if there's any specific headwinds or tailwinds we should be keeping in mind as we think about forecasting EPS this year?"", 'Mark Singleton', ""Yes, I think we feel good about our revenue growth. But I think coming out of Q4 into Q1, we're looking forward to return to focusing on growing the top line in the bottom in 2024. You look at the bottom end of our guidance is roughly 4% growth at the top end, roughly 7%.From an EBITDA perspective, as we've told you in our third quarter call, we're not expecting a significant increase in EBITDA from 2024, but mainly just back to the two year recovery that we've seen that we've talked about some, but over the long term, certainly expected trying to focus on and expect to be driving the bottom line faster than the top line as we are continuing to work through 2024."", ""Got it. That's helpful. And then just maybe as a follow-up to that, I think gross margin has seen some fluctuation and headwinds from some of these reimbursement challenges. So how should we be thinking about margins progressing from here on what headwinds and tailwinds should you be keeping in mind as we update our models, if you if you look at our gross, our gross margin from 2023 and 2024 expected to be even year to year."", 'Mark Singleton', ""So don't expect a significant change. If you look at Q4 specifically, we had a write off that impacted the fourth quarter margin. That is really a one-time write off that was related to them are ultrasonics portfolio and really a product transition where we evaluated them the old inventory that we had and the potential disruption for customers that we wanted to avoid and looked at the excess inventory and took a one-time write-off in 4Q that was that should not repeat from. But from an overall 23 to 24, we won't we don't expect any some significant changes on margin."", 'Okay, thanks so much.', 'Operator', 'As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star then one to enter the question queue. Next question comes from Caitlin Cronin with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.', 'Caitlin Cronin', 'Congrats on a good quarter, just with two treatments, impressive growth in the Q4 in 2024, do you expect most of the growth to a degree driven by dual lanes? We expect growth in all three product lines to really drive that mid to high single-digit growth.', 'Mark Singleton', ""Thanks, Cait. And I appreciate the question again. We are the only company out there with the with a full portfolio of the one, three and five injections, we feel really good about the clinical differentiation that we have internally and certainly growth percentage wise, Sterling will definitely lead the way, but we will continue to expect Janssen to grow as we talked about earlier in the year.Two parts is a great story in that we have haven't had great expectations with that, I'd say over the last few years, but it continues to outperform our expectations. So we would look to that to be a low single-digit grower. So the portfolio really led by early and back to the great contract positions we have in the market and with the execution on the falling through volume by our sales team, which we're really proud of. We expect that to continue into 2024. But the whole portfolio, we definitely we'd expect to grow volume-wise. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks about having some pricing headwinds related to CMS from a year-over-year perspective in the first half of the year, but expect that that will sequentially improve as we go through 2024 Got it."", 'Caitlin Cronin', 'Okay. And then just turning to Exogen, you noted continued improvement in the US in Q4 and how did action perform globally in Q4? And and what are your growth expectations in 2024 for both you and you?', 'Mark Singleton', ""Yes, when we own AxoGen, AxoGen's a significant opportunity for us. I think we've been disappointed over the last few years where we have had that product declining from and it started to return back to at least being even then a slightly positive growth in Q4.When we look at this product over the long term, we really looked at it from a low single digit grower. The team has spent a lot a lot of time in, say the management team myself, Rob, early on and the leaders of that organization really getting into this business and trying to figure out how are we going to increase this and maintain and sustain the growth that we've started. I mean this is another situation, Rob and I went into the field and spent some time with some sales reps well and really learned a lot about the details of this with all of our sales reps. And so when we look into the future, again, we're B&O confident that we can return this back to small single digit growth. And it's a great product and a lot of positive feedback from the physicians and in the field."", 'Robert Claypoole', ""And Cait, I'll just echo what Mark said. I mean, as you probably know, fantastic proven technology and an excellent brand recognition. And just like Mark said, the customer feedback during our visits has been extremely positive. So we're bringing back the appropriate level of focus to the business. And now we're going to address some operational inefficiencies along the way in order to return the business to growth."", 'Caitlin Cronin', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rob. Please poll for any closing.', 'Robert Claypoole', 'Thanks, Betsy, and thanks again, everyone, for your interest and momentum. We drove a significant improvement across our business in 2023.

Tom and David Gardner recommended Amazon.com and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) years before those online innovators were cool. Without those astute insights, The Motley Fool might not have existed today.', 'Or you can look at my personal history. I dove headlong into that brand-new ""Internet"" thing in 1995, spending every spare moment in my Swedish college\'s computer rooms to explore the rudimentary world wide web at dial-up speeds. Two years later, I had met a girl in an online game and transferred to her school in Florida, working out the whole transfer process by email.', ""By the end of the millennium, the office of admissions at my new school wanted me to stay after graduation as their webmaster. And in 2024, I'm still married to that American girl I met on an Icelandic game server 29 years ago and all my work is online. Let's just say that the internet has been a game-changer for me."", ""I'm no future-telling oracle, but I did have the foresight to follow the Gardner brothers' advice years before joining the Motley Fool's writing crew. And just as I was early to the digital revolution, I may have found two companies currently poised for remarkable long-term growth, similar to the early days of Amazon and Netflix."", ""As it happens, the first name on my list used to be a subsidiary of Netflix. Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) started life as the designer of set-top boxes that could move Netflix's video-streaming experience from laptop screens to living-room TVs."", 'The DVD-mailer king struggled in the transition to digital video streams, but astute investors who bought Netflix stock during the Qwikster storm have been handsomely rewarded in the long run. For example, the shares I picked up at the end of October 2011 have gained almost exactly 5,000% so far.', ""Much like Netflix's stock in 2011, Roku's share price is down on unreasonable grounds nowadays. Bearish investors worry about the usual headline numbers -- Roku's sales growth slowed down in 2022 and 2023 while bottom-line earnings dipped into negative numbers. But -- stop me if you've heard this before -- these undesirable financial trends simply reflected how Roku chose to conduct its business during the inflation-tinged economic downturn."", ""Many companies raised prices in an effort to pass their increased expenses on to their customers. Roku didn't contribute to the inflationary trend that way. Instead, the company held prices steady in order to win more end-market customers and a larger market share during this difficult period."", 'As a result, Roku is selling streaming devices below cost. You can call it a marketing expense if you like, and an effective one. The number of active Roku accounts rose from 70 million names in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 80 million users one year later.', ""Oh, and Roku may report negative earnings but its cash profits are positive and rising. The company converted 5% of its 2023 revenues into free cash flows, reflecting generous amounts of stock-based compensation and video content amortization. Keep in mind that cash flows show the movement of actual cash in and out of a company's bank accounts, while earnings are an accounting construct related to tax reporting. So I don't mind low or negative earnings alongside robust cash flows -- that's just clever accounting that keeps tax expenses low."", ""Digital advertising is coming back from the inflation crisis at its own sluggish pace, with the media and entertainment (M&E) sector lagging behind the ad-buying market at large. That's bad news for Roku, who generates most of its revenues from ad sales with an outsized contribution from the M&E sector. But no downturn lasts forever and I think it's both shortsighted and unfair to reduce your calculation of Roku's long-term value based on a temporary challenge."", ""Yet, the M&E advertising headwind and negative earnings still dominate the stock market's thinking about Roku and its stock. Share prices stand more than 85% below the all-time highs from the summer of 2021 and 40% down from the annual peaks in November 2023. You can pick up Roku shares at the modest valuation of 2.7 times sales."", ""That's a bargain in my book, more suitable for a slow-growth cash machine than an early stage growth phenom. One of these lines is not like the other, and I think it's just a matter of time before Wall Street gets back to its senses. Roku deserves a much richer valuation and the company has many years of greenfield growth opportunities ahead. You don't want to be left empty-handed when this goofy discount pricing ends:"", ""Next, let's take a quick look at SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). This company provides voice control and audio analytics software and services to auto makers, drive-through restaurants, any business with a phone-based menu system, and more. For example, SoundHound AI has managed the voice-control functions in Netflix's reference design for set-top boxes since 2019."", 'Its software relies on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) engines, trained on two decades of song identification services and an ongoing stream of fresh voice-control commands.', ""SoundHound AI's deep learning systems produce a better user experience than simpler systems with basic speech-to-text interpretation. And the company has a modest approach to its brand so far -- customers are typically free to skip the SoundHound AI and Houndify branding altogether and present their tweaked voice control systems under their own brand names."", ""So you may never notice that you're using a SoundHound AI service when talking to ChatGPT in your Stellantis car or ordering burgers at the local White Castle drive-through. Whether you know it or not, that's the Houndify platform at work, and the client network is growing larger over time."", ""This is still a very small company, barely scratching the surface of a massive global market. SoundHound AI's revenues stopped at $46 million in fiscal year 2023, but the company has a backlog of unfilled orders and long-term contracts worth $661 million. That backlog doubled in size last year."", 'So SoundHound AI is building a rocket engine to drive years and years of terrific business growth. The stock recently soared as AI technology giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) revealed a small investment in SoundHound AI, but the stock still trades more than 20% below the price of its initial public offering (IPO) in 2021. With currently tiny revenue streams supported by $661 million in firm long-term order bookings, the stock may look expensive from a simple price-to-sales perspective but affordable in light of the robust bookings backlog.', ""And don't forget that voice control and audio analysis specialists have a history of attracting buyout offers. Shazam is an Apple subsidiary since 2018. Nuance Communications joined forces with Microsoft four years later. I can imagine a bidding war breaking out over SoundHound AI if another couple of tech giants want to get an instant foot in the voice-control door without doing decades of advanced voice-based AI research."", ""Both SoundHound AI and Roku look deeply undervalued right now, especially when you consider the absolutely gigantic target markets they are pursuing. I can't promise that either one will follow in the market-beating footsteps of Amazon and Netflix, but their growth prospects have inspired me to buy both stocks in recent months."", ""These spicy growth stocks may not be your cup of tea, but they have a lot in common with how Netflix inspired me in 2011 and Amazon caught David Gardner's eye in 2002."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?', 'Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.', 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

After regulatory pressures and lawsuits, Apple eventually allowed Netflix users to circumvent the 30% fee by directing them to the Netflix website. Netflix subscribers haven't been able to subscribe to Netflix using the App Store billing since 2018, but many remained on their pre-2018 plans, meaning Apple took their fees. Last month, Netflix announced it would be forcing some users to change their billing method away from the App Store or risk their accounts being closed."", 'Amazon.com Inc. went through a similar issue with its Prime Video services, before cutting a deal to integrate with AppleTV to avoid the hefty fee.', 'One of the most outspoken critics of this policy is Fortnite creator and Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. Sweeney, an outspoken Apple critic for years, recently sued the tech giant. The company sells billions of dollars in digital goods per year on Fortnite, meaning the company pays millions in fees for those who play the game on mobile devices.

Epic planned to launch a competitor to the App Store, which resulted in Epic Games's developer account being banned. After some challenges under the DMA from the EU, Apple reinstated the account shortly after."", 'While this led to Sweeney touting the battle as ""victory"" on X, it led Y Combinator Co-Founder Paul Graham to comment with a larger question: Is Apple evil?', 'Graham\'s post stated, ""Apple just terminated Epic’s developer account, and they admitted that this tweet was one of the reasons. We don’t want to think about Apple being evil. It would be so inconvenient. We don’t want to switch to Android.

When it comes to streaming, Disney is at a disadvantage with higher marketing expenses, along with customer acquistion and retention costs\xa0due to not having the technological capabilities of Netflix.', 'Disney expects its streaming business that includes\xa0Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+\xa0will reach the profitable shore by the end of the September fiscal quarter.

Besides Disney+, Hulu is also an important part of the company’s streaming vision. Disney is in the process of\xa0finalizing its buyout of\xa0the\xa033% stake in Hulu\xa0from NBCUniversal. Despite not being global like Disney+, Hulu\xa0became a good brand with good content. There’s also ESPN+ with which Disney got sports covered. Last month, Disney made an agreement with\xa0Fox Corporation (NASDAQ: FOXA)\xa0and Warner Bros\xa0Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) to put\xa0all their sports programming under a single broadband roof. According to Variety,\xa0Disney, Fox and WBD together control\xa0about\xa085% of the U.S. sports rights market.

Gold typically does well under rising prices as an inflation hedge. Like other commodities, it doesn’t perform up to snuff during disinflationary cycles.', 'However, as The Wall Street Journal pointed out not too long ago, consumer prices have been rising faster than expected. Stated differently, inflation is sticky; that is, prices are not responding to supply and demand changes. Therefore, this dynamic could lead to persistent inflation. That’s bad news for consumers but potentially great news for gold stocks to buy.', 'By acquiring shares of gold mining firms and royalty/streaming specialists, investors can indirectly receive an inflation hedge without the hassles of physical bullion ownership. Further, given the red-hot labor market, it’s possible that prices can rise before they decline. If so, you’ll want to keep close tabs on these gold stocks to buy.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: T.

Yes, it features a massive projecting at its Olympic Dam underground copper mine in South Australia. Along with copper, Olympic Dam offers uranium, silver and gold.', 'On the positive side, with BHP stock, you’re not just getting one business – you get exposure to several. Theoretically, if one segment falters, the others can help pick up the slack. However, on the downside, investors shouldn’t expect outrageous returns from BHP. Again, it’s a name to tiptoe into the space.', 'For full disclosure, the company has some challenges on its hands. In the fiscal year ended June 2023, BHP posted sales of $53.82 billion, down from the $65.1 billion posted a year earlier. Also, on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis, BHP is looking at modest sales growth of $55.34 billion.', 'Still, one awesome attribute is the company’s forward dividend yield of nearly 5%. That’s something to consider if you’re interested in gold stocks to buy.', 'Source: Misunseo / Shutterstock.com', 'A mining company that produces both gold and copper, Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) ranks among the gold stocks to buy, commanding a market capitalization north of $27 billion. Per its public profile, Barrick features 16 operating sites in 13 countries. As of December of last year, the company had 77 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves.', 'Looking ahead to the end of the current fiscal year, analysts expect Barrick to generate revenue of $12.24 billion. If so, the tally would represent an increase of 7.4% from last year’s haul of $11.4 billion. Looking out to 2025, they project revenue to land at $13.32 billion. That would be almost a 9% lift from 2024’s estimated top line.', 'Even better, the most optimist target calls for sales of $13.38 billion and $14.52 billion in 2024 and 2025, respectively. Right now, shares trade at 20.75X trailing-year earnings. To be fair, that’s not exactly an absolute deal. However, it’s a significantly lower multiple than what we saw in the second quarter of last year.', 'Lastly, analysts peg shares a consensus strong buy with a $20.32 average price target.', 'Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock', 'Although Newmont (NYSE:NEM) is a giant among gold stocks to buy, its market performance this year has been much more humbling. Still, with gold prices rising to three-month highs based on rising rate cut bets, NEM looks intriguing for speculation. After all, its website states that it’s the world’s largest gold mining corporation.', 'Despite a rough outing last year, analysts anticipate a recovery for this year. Specifically, they project on average for revenue to hit $21.93 billion. If so, that would be a 36.7% lift from 2023’s tally of just over $16 billion. What’s more, by the end of 2025, they estimate that sales could land at $23.38 billion. If that’s the case, we’re talking growth of 6.6% from 2024’s projected revenue.', 'If that wasn’t enticing enough, the most optimistic target calls for revenue of $24.25 billion and $25.11 billion in 2024 and 2025, respectively. Plus, while NEM stock isn’t exactly a sterling deal, it trades at less than 12X forward earnings. That’s slightly undervalued compared to the industry’s median value of 12.35X.', 'In closing, Wall Street’s experts rate NEM a consensus moderate buy with a $44.07 average price target.', 'Source: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock', 'A streaming specialist, Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM) isn’t a direct mining play. Instead, the company inks an agreement with a mining firm to purchase some or all of the physical metals production. The pricing involves a predetermined discount to which both parties agree. This way, Wheaton enjoys a level of predictability that’s not often found in gold stocks to buy.', 'Investors will want to be aware that on March 14, Wheaton will release its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report. For 2023, revenue is anticipated to land on average at $1.1 billion, down 5.6% from the prior year. However, earnings per share should hit $1.15, better than the last year’s EPS of $1.12.', 'However, in 2024, analysts see a huge expansionary year, with sales up to $1.21 billion. That would represent a 20.6% lift from 2023’s projected revenue. And while EPS may slip slightly to $1.14, the high-side estimate calls for $1.45.', 'Overall, the Street pegs WPM a moderate buy with a $53.94 average price target. Combined with its modest dividend and predictable business, it’s one of the gold stocks to buy.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'A similar enterprise to Wheaton Precious Metals, Sandstorm Gold (NYSE:SAND) generally focuses on royalties. In exchange for an upfront payment to mining companies, Sandstrom will receive a percentage of the revenue generated from the sale of the mined metals. However, it also accepts royalties in the form of physical metal streams.', 'Fundamentally, the primary benefit between royalty and streaming companies are the same: superior pricing predictability. That said, Sandstorm may be the riskier idea between the two. By the end of this year, analysts project that Sandstorm’s revenue haul will be $168.68 million, down 6.1% from last year’s tally. However, in 2025, they project sales to hit $189.47 million, which may offer a nice recovery.', 'One factor to keep note of, though, is the valuation. Currently, Sandstorm’s trailing-year earnings multiple clocks in at 32X. That’s a significant leap higher from Q2 2023’s print of 15.52X.', 'Nevertheless, analysts are bullish on SAND stock, rating shares a consensus strong buy. The average price target lands at $6.80, with the high-side estimate coming in at $10.75.', 'Source: aerogondo2 / Shutterstock.com', 'Moving onto the more speculative arena of gold stocks to buy, DRDGold (NYSE:DRD) is a South African gold producer. It’s also a specialist in the recovery of the metal from the retreatment of surface tailings. Since May of last year, DRD stock has incurred one of the oddest trading patterns I’ve seen. It’s almost like a serrated downward sloping saw.', 'However, an inflationary environment for the dollar may be what’s needed to instill some pricing stability in DRD stock. Financially, there are plenty of reasons to be intrigued with the underlying enterprise. For one thing, the company enjoys a solid balance sheet, particularly a low debt-to-equity ratio. Also, its Altman Z-Score clocks in at 5.46, indicating little risk of imminent bankruptcy.', 'In addition, it’s a very profitable enterprise. DRDGold enjoys solid margins across the board. Over the past decade, it has printed nine years of net income. That helps to add credibility to its 4.69% dividend yield.', 'Lastly, H.C. Wainwright’s Heiko Ihle pegs DRDGold a “buy” with a $13.25 price target.', 'Source: Alexander Limbach / Shutterstock', 'A literal penny stock, you want to be extremely careful with GoldMining (NYSEAMERICAN:GLDG). Right now, many financial publication readers love consuming stories about speculative ideas – and I aim to please. However, please be aware that entities like GLDG are wildly volatile and unpredictable.', 'Financially, the gold exploration company presents a high-risk, high-reward profile. Per investment data aggregator Gurufocus, GoldMining suffers from negative EBITDA growth, along with negative free cash flow. As well, other key metrics such as return on equity and return on asset are all negative. That’s not surprising because the company doesn’t generate revenue. Again, it’s an exploration company.', 'Frankly, these are long-shot wagers. However, one positive I can say is that its equity-to-asset ratio lands at 0.95X, better than 79.34% of the metals and mining industry. Plus, it enjoys a sizable cash balance relative to debt.', 'Of course, the idea here is to speculate that GoldMining strikes it big. H.C. Wainwright’s Heiko Ihle has again expressed belief in this risky idea, rating shares a “buy” with a $4.50 price target.

Most of all in Europe. With war returning to the continent after decades of peace, countries in the region are racking up their defenses amid the turmoil in their neighborhood. French officials are considering increasing the size of the country’s reserve force, while the government in Poland has announced to recruit 150,000 additional troops over the next decade to take its number of active military personnel beyond the 300,000 mark. On the other hand, Sweden has decided to involve its society as a whole for national security, and formed a civil defense force.', 'Defense expenditure is also on the rise in Europe, with the continent in 2022 witnessing its steepest rise in military spending in three decades. According to a recent report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), arms exports by European countries have grown 94% between 2014-2018 and 2019-2023. The United States was the origin of 55% of all arms imported by European countries in the last five years, which resulted in a 17% increase in its arms exports compared to 2014-2018.', 'The spike in military spending has meant a boom for the defense industry. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) generated $67.6 billion in revenue in 2023, which was 2.4% higher than the previous year. Its net profit also increased from $5.7 billion in 2022 to $6.9 billion in 2023. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s stock price has risen 9.4% since the Ukraine war broke out two years ago.

With a $158 billion backlog and almost 30% of its revenue coming from building F-35 aircraft with deliveries forecast to reach 180 per year (up from 141 in 2022) in the coming years, we believe the company could grow at a higher rate than overall defense budget growth and Street expectations over the next several years. Further, strategic acquisitions, debt repayment, a 2.9% dividend yield, and continued share buybacks from more than $6 billion per year of free cash flow should lead to even greater shareholder returns.

In each of the past four years, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite, have traded off bear and bull markets in successive years.', ""For the moment, the bulls are running wild on Wall Street, with all three major indexes rallying to record-closing highs in 2024. But just because the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite are breaking through their previous ceilings, it doesn't mean amazing deals can't still be uncovered by opportunistic investors."", ""With most brokerages doing away with barriers to investment, it's an especially smart time to put your money to work on Wall Street. In recent years, most online brokers have eliminated minimum deposit requirements and commission fees associated with common stock trades on major U.S. exchanges. For retail investors, it means any amount of money -- even $300 -- can be the perfect amount to invest."", ""If you have $300 that's ready to be put to work, and you're absolutely certain this isn't cash you'll need to pay bills or cover emergency expenses when they arise, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now."", 'The first reliable industry leader that looks like a phenomenal deal for investors with $300 in available cash is Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), which is commonly referred to as ""BofA.""', ""If there's a knock against U.S. bank stocks, it's that they're inherently cyclical. This is to say that they ebb-and-flow with the health of the U.S. economy. Over the past couple of months, quite a few money-based metrics and economic indicators have raised red flags and pointed to the growing likelihood of a recession in the not-too-distant future. When downturns take shape, it's not uncommon for bank profits to decline as they set aside more capital for loan losses."", 'However, the economic cycle is a two-way street that undeniably favors the patient. In the 78-plus years since World War II ended, nine of the 12 U.S. recessions resolved in under a year. Meanwhile, the remaining three failed to surpass 18 months. Comparatively, most periods of growth have lasted multiple years. Disproportionately long periods of expansion allow banks to steadily grow their loan portfolios and generate higher profits over the long run.', ""What makes BofA ideally suited for investors' portfolios right now is its interest rate sensitivity. Over the past two years, the Federal Reserve has increased its federal funds rate at the fastest pace in four decades. When interest rates rise, lending institutions almost always benefit by collecting more net-interest income from outstanding variable-rate loans. No U.S. money-center bank is better positioned to benefit from higher interest rates than Bank of America. The Fed's hawkish stance has added billions of dollars in net-interest income each quarter to its bottom line."", ""As I've previously pointed out, Bank of America's digitization initiatives are paying dividends, too. Although BofA certainly isn't the first name that comes to mind when you think of financial technology (fintech) investments, the company's efforts to encourage digital banking have worked. As of the end of 2023, 75% of its consumer households were banking digitally, and nearly half of all loan sales were completed online or via mobile app. These digital transactions are considerably cheaper for the company than in-person interactions, and they'll help improve BofA's operating efficiency over time."", ""Bank of America's valuation is also enticing. Shares can be picked up right now for roughly 10 times Wall Street's consensus earnings in 2025, and for just a shade above its listed book value, as of Dec. 31, 2023. High-quality banks trading for right around their book values are often steals."", ""A second no-brainer stock that's begging to be bought by opportunistic investors with $300 right now is none other than China's leading e-commerce company Alibaba (NYSE: BABA)."", ""The biggest concern with China stocks for the moment is that recent economic data has disappointed. China's economy has traditionally grown at a superior pace to most developed markets. A subpar growth rate, coupled with the heightened (and occasionally unpredictable) oversight of Chinese regulators, can make China-based stocks riskier investments."", ""The counter to the above argument is that Chinese regulators were guided by a very strict COVID-19 mitigation strategy for three years, which led to extended and unpredictable lockdowns that crippled supply chains and consumer/enterprise buying power. Although China ended this controversial practice in December 2022, it's going to take time for China's economy to regain its luster. Once it finds its footing, China's economy can outpace most developed countries in the growth department."", ""To add to the above, China's emerging middle class should help sustain double-digit growth for online retail sales in the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. Based on estimates from the International Trade Administration in April 2023, Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall combined for a nearly 51% share of e-commerce in China."", ""Beyond what should be steady e-commerce growth, Alibaba is also the clear leader in cloud infrastructure service spending in mainland China. Tech-analysis firm Canalys estimated this past June that Alibaba Cloud accounted for 34% of the $7.7 billion in enterprise cloud infrastructure spending in China during the first quarter of 2023. The margins associated with cloud services are considerably higher than those for online retail sales, which means this segment could be the company's core cash-flow driver throughout the remainder of the decade."", 'Lastly, Alibaba is cheap and absolutely swimming in cash. It ended last year with nearly $92 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investment and other treasury investments, and its board has authorized in excess of $35 billion for share buybacks.

Around 100,000 lawsuits allege that J&J's baby powder causes cancer. Though the company has attempted to settle this litigation on two separate occasions, both offers were thrown out in court. As a general rule, Wall Street dislikes financial uncertainty."", ""On the other hand, Johnson & Johnson is one of only two publicly traded companies that Standard & Poor's (S&P), a division of S&P Global, has anointed with its highest possible credit rating (AAA). Thanks to J&J's cash-rich balance sheet and its highly predictable annual cash flow, S&P has the utmost confidence that the company can service its debt obligations and eventually put this matter in the back seat."", ""What really makes Johnson & Johnson tick is the company's pharmaceutical segment. Even though its medical technologies division is well-positioned to grow as the U.S. and global population ages, the company's decisive shift to generate more of its sales from brand-name drugs has helped lift its adjusted operating earnings almost every year over the past four decades. Novel therapies offer high margins and provide J&J with exceptional drug-pricing power."", ""Another under-the-radar key to Johnson & Johnson's long-term success has been its consistency in key leadership positions. J&J's CEOs have historically stuck around for a decade, or longer. Continuity at the top has helped J&J's operating growth stay on track."", 'The final piece of the puzzle is that Johnson & Johnson stock is historically inexpensive. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14.6 represents a nearly 10% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing-five-year period.

Most of all in Europe. With war returning to the continent after decades of peace, countries in the region are racking up their defenses amid the turmoil in their neighborhood. French officials are considering increasing the size of the country’s reserve force, while the government in Poland has announced to recruit 150,000 additional troops over the next decade to take its number of active military personnel beyond the 300,000 mark. On the other hand, Sweden has decided to involve its society as a whole for national security, and formed a civil defense force.', 'Defense expenditure is also on the rise in Europe, with the continent in 2022 witnessing its steepest rise in military spending in three decades. According to a recent report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), arms exports by European countries have grown 94% between 2014-2018 and 2019-2023. The United States was the origin of 55% of all arms imported by European countries in the last five years, which resulted in a 17% increase in its arms exports compared to 2014-2018.', 'The spike in military spending has meant a boom for the defense industry. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) generated $67.6 billion in revenue in 2023, which was 2.4% higher than the previous year. Its net profit also increased from $5.7 billion in 2022 to $6.9 billion in 2023. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s stock price has risen 9.4% since the Ukraine war broke out two years ago.

With a $158 billion backlog and almost 30% of its revenue coming from building F-35 aircraft with deliveries forecast to reach 180 per year (up from 141 in 2022) in the coming years, we believe the company could grow at a higher rate than overall defense budget growth and Street expectations over the next several years.

To skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Oversold Healthcare Stocks To Buy Right Now.', 'The healthcare sector has been popular among investors for some time now, but it is starting to become the new ""2024 idea"" for investing portfolios because of its performance so far. Biotechnology companies, in particular, have been seen to have a ""massive breakout"" in February, according to BTIG\'s Chief Market Technician, Jonathan Krinsky, who joined CNBC\'s ""Closing Bell"" to discuss the potential upside for the healthcare sector this year on February 27. Here are some of his comments:', '""It [healthcare] was our top pick in December, coming into the year. I think it started with the mega caps, Eli Lilly, that kind of trade. Now we\'re seeing a broadening. If you look at year-to-date performance on an equal weight basis, healthcare is the best performing sector on an equal weight basis. So it is brought underneath, and you know, if you compare it to technology it\'s not had the big hockey stick moves right now, so I think there\'s still some runway to go.""', ""Considering Krinsky's comments, it is unsurprising that many are now looking at the healthcare sector this year as a viable and potentially attractive investment opportunity. Though the sector may lack some of the excitement associated with the technology sector, and artificial intelligence stocks in particular, healthcare is now beginning to take the stage as an alluring investment space with immense room to grow in profitability and upside potential. This is especially the case if one is looking to invest in top performers in the healthcare sector, such as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)."", 'One of the most popular areas within the healthcare sector today is that of obesity and weight loss drugs. A major player in this area is the mega-cap\xa0Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), mentioned by Krinsky on CNBC\'s ""Closing Bell."" This company has been working tirelessly in the past to highlight obesity as a medical condition that requires proper attention and diagnosis alongside treatment. Dr. Angela Fitch, a Chief Medical Officer at Knownwell and President of the Obesity Medicine Association, joined CNBC\'s ""Squawk Box"" on March 8 to discuss Eli Lilly and Company\'s (NYSE:LLY) new obesity drug ads. Here are some of her observations on the matter:', '""Obesity as a chronic disease has not gotten the attention it deserves. It\'s the biggest epidemic in our country and the world actually right now, and it\'s just nice to see this sort of public service annoucement recognizing the criticality of treating obesity today as a chronic disease.""', 'According to Dr. Fitch, over a hundred million people in the US qualify for treatment when it comes to the disease of obesity, a figure that underscores the pertinence of this issue, particularly in the US, and highlights the existence of a massive market for obesity and weight loss drugs from the perspective of companies marketing these products. A contentious point up for debate when it comes to these drugs, though, is their highly expensive prices. Healthcare companies charge massive amounts for granting access to these drugs, which may serve them well by way of profitability and may be an attractive point from an investment point of view. Still, the US government has been attempting to regulate the prices of these drugs for the benefit of the regular consumer who may be in dire need of obesity medication but unable to afford it. Whatever the outcome of the pricing debate may be, it is undeniable that healthcare companies are beginning to attract attention this year. As a result, it may be a good idea to keep an eye on which names in this sector are oversold stocks or overbought stocks. We have thus compiled a list of oversold stocks in the healthcare sector. These include some cheap healthcare stocks and other healthcare stocks to consider investing in.', 'Scientist in a lab working on a research project, focusing on biotechnology and healthcare advancements.', 'Our Methodology\xa0', ""We used the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator to pick oversold stocks in the healthcare sector for our list. The RSI indicator is a momentum indicator used in the technical analysis of stocks by measuring the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate whether the price of that security is overvalued or undervalued. Stocks with RSI values of over 70 are traditionally considered overbought, while those with RSI values under 30 are oversold. We used a stock screener to find healthcare stocks with RSI values under 30 and then ranked them based on this metric, from the highest to the lowest RSI value. We also mentioned the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock, using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by over 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

The company’s first platform, the Chromium, is dominant within the single-cell space. The Chromium utilizes advanced microfluidics to separate a sample into individual cells. Each cell is enveloped in its own droplet, where an individual reaction occurs to detect the expression profile of that cell. This occurs in parallel across tens of thousands of droplets, enabling high-throughput and granular characterization of a sample. 10x Genomics’ second platform is the Visium platform for spatial analysis. Visium employs a slide with many small dots (55 microns in diameter), each of which has a unique barcode. The barcodes are read by next-generation sequencing equipment. This enables researchers to detect expression patterns (genetic behavior) across geographic regions of a tissue sample. Finally, the company is launching its third major platform, the Xenium for in-situ analysis. The in-situ platform allows researchers to visualize biomarkers of interest right on the tissue slide, in real time. The images are processed on-instrument versus Visium, which requires barcodes that a separate sequencer reads.', 'Our conviction in 10x Genomics is driven by multiple growth drivers over the next several years. First, for the single-cell platform, the company has a new kit called Flex that enables sample multiplexing and working with FFPE (preserved) samples. We think this opens up translational studies that rely on archival samples. This marks an opportunity to expand into biopharmaceuticals (whereas historically the company has been predominantly conducting basic research). Second, we think there is upside from the new product cycle with the in-situ Xenium. We believe the platform is differentiated by its throughput, paired with a panel approach that allows customers to add customization to their research projects. In the near term,10X Genomics’ margins may be pressured by the bolus of Xenium boxes being placed, which are generally, lower-margin razors. This will eventually lead to a stream of consumables (razor blades) sales at much higher margins. We like 10x Genomics as a high-quality life science research company with multiple shots on goal. The company has a strong balance sheet with $400 million in cash and no debt, and with visibility to FCF breakeven in the near term. We see 10x Genomics as a consistent double-digit grower, with over 80% of revenues coming from high-margin and recurring consumables, roughly 70% gross margins, and a path to over 30% EBITDA margins longer term.”', 'While being part of our oversold stocks list, 10x Genomics, Inc.

In each of the past four years, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite, have traded off bear and bull markets in successive years.', ""For the moment, the bulls are running wild on Wall Street, with all three major indexes rallying to record-closing highs in 2024. But just because the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite are breaking through their previous ceilings, it doesn't mean amazing deals can't still be uncovered by opportunistic investors."", ""With most brokerages doing away with barriers to investment, it's an especially smart time to put your money to work on Wall Street. In recent years, most online brokers have eliminated minimum deposit requirements and commission fees associated with common stock trades on major U.S. exchanges. For retail investors, it means any amount of money -- even $300 -- can be the perfect amount to invest."", ""If you have $300 that's ready to be put to work, and you're absolutely certain this isn't cash you'll need to pay bills or cover emergency expenses when they arise, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now."", 'The first reliable industry leader that looks like a phenomenal deal for investors with $300 in available cash is Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), which is commonly referred to as ""BofA.""', ""If there's a knock against U.S. bank stocks, it's that they're inherently cyclical. This is to say that they ebb-and-flow with the health of the U.S. economy. Over the past couple of months, quite a few money-based metrics and economic indicators have raised red flags and pointed to the growing likelihood of a recession in the not-too-distant future. When downturns take shape, it's not uncommon for bank profits to decline as they set aside more capital for loan losses."", 'However, the economic cycle is a two-way street that undeniably favors the patient. In the 78-plus years since World War II ended, nine of the 12 U.S. recessions resolved in under a year. Meanwhile, the remaining three failed to surpass 18 months. Comparatively, most periods of growth have lasted multiple years. Disproportionately long periods of expansion allow banks to steadily grow their loan portfolios and generate higher profits over the long run.', ""What makes BofA ideally suited for investors' portfolios right now is its interest rate sensitivity. Over the past two years, the Federal Reserve has increased its federal funds rate at the fastest pace in four decades. When interest rates rise, lending institutions almost always benefit by collecting more net-interest income from outstanding variable-rate loans. No U.S. money-center bank is better positioned to benefit from higher interest rates than Bank of America. The Fed's hawkish stance has added billions of dollars in net-interest income each quarter to its bottom line."", ""As I've previously pointed out, Bank of America's digitization initiatives are paying dividends, too. Although BofA certainly isn't the first name that comes to mind when you think of financial technology (fintech) investments, the company's efforts to encourage digital banking have worked. As of the end of 2023, 75% of its consumer households were banking digitally, and nearly half of all loan sales were completed online or via mobile app. These digital transactions are considerably cheaper for the company than in-person interactions, and they'll help improve BofA's operating efficiency over time."", ""Bank of America's valuation is also enticing. Shares can be picked up right now for roughly 10 times Wall Street's consensus earnings in 2025, and for just a shade above its listed book value, as of Dec. 31, 2023. High-quality banks trading for right around their book values are often steals."", ""A second no-brainer stock that's begging to be bought by opportunistic investors with $300 right now is none other than China's leading e-commerce company Alibaba (NYSE: BABA)."", ""The biggest concern with China stocks for the moment is that recent economic data has disappointed. China's economy has traditionally grown at a superior pace to most developed markets. A subpar growth rate, coupled with the heightened (and occasionally unpredictable) oversight of Chinese regulators, can make China-based stocks riskier investments."", ""The counter to the above argument is that Chinese regulators were guided by a very strict COVID-19 mitigation strategy for three years, which led to extended and unpredictable lockdowns that crippled supply chains and consumer/enterprise buying power. Although China ended this controversial practice in December 2022, it's going to take time for China's economy to regain its luster. Once it finds its footing, China's economy can outpace most developed countries in the growth department."", ""To add to the above, China's emerging middle class should help sustain double-digit growth for online retail sales in the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. Based on estimates from the International Trade Administration in April 2023, Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall combined for a nearly 51% share of e-commerce in China."", ""Beyond what should be steady e-commerce growth, Alibaba is also the clear leader in cloud infrastructure service spending in mainland China. Tech-analysis firm Canalys estimated this past June that Alibaba Cloud accounted for 34% of the $7.7 billion in enterprise cloud infrastructure spending in China during the first quarter of 2023. The margins associated with cloud services are considerably higher than those for online retail sales, which means this segment could be the company's core cash-flow driver throughout the remainder of the decade."", 'Lastly, Alibaba is cheap and absolutely swimming in cash. It ended last year with nearly $92 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investment and other treasury investments, and its board has authorized in excess of $35 billion for share buybacks. Excluding its cash, Alibaba is valued at less than 5 times forward-year earnings, which represents a potentially generational buying opportunity.', 'The third no-brainer stock long-term investors can confidently buy with $300 right now is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), which is best-known by its shorthand, ""J&J.""', ""The reason J&J has lagged the iconic Dow and S&P 500 in the return column over the past two years is because of the uncertainty of outstanding litigation regarding its now-discontinued talcum-based baby powder.

The country has above-average scores in income, employment, education, social connections, life satisfaction, and environmental quality. In terms of the economy, the US performed well in 2023, achieving a GDP growth rate of 2.5%, surpassing other G7 nations. This performance can be attributed to the strong structural fundamentals and effective policy responses by the USA. However, economic growth is anticipated to slow down in 2024 due to the impact of monetary policy. Meanwhile, inflation, a major concern in 2023, is expected to decrease to 2.4% in 2024, though still exceeding the Federal Reserve's target. The average household disposable income per capita and the average household net wealth in the US stand\xa0at $51,147 annually and $684,500 per year, respectively. This is much higher than the OECD average."", ""In 2023, the United States maintained a low unemployment rate, reaching an unprecedented low of 3.7% in December 2023. This indicates a tight labor market characterized by strong job creation. However, projections for 2024 suggest a cooling off of the labor market. The country's labor participation rate, standing at 67%, signifies the percentage of the working-age population either employed or actively seeking employment. The rate is higher than the OECD average of 66%. The US also has a robust education system. There is easy access to education, which can be judged by the fact that 92% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education. Along with this, the country is home to some of the most esteemed educational institutions in the world, such as Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology."", 'While the nation has undeniable strengths, the multifaceted nature of quality of life reveals certain disparities and challenges. Disparities also exist among states for various metrics; for instance, the cheapest states to live in may not necessarily be the best states for starting a family due to lower rankings in education and health facilities. In terms of health, the United States, while having a higher life expectancy than some other countries, has experienced stagnation in this metric over the years, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control. Despite the presence of healthcare facilities, millions of Americans remain without health insurance, even with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Ongoing efforts to expand access or introduce a single-payer system face political resistance. Additionally, medical expenses pose a significant burden for many Americans, with high insurance premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs creating financial strain and limiting access to quality care. Healthcare companies such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc.

But analysts say that funding cuts in the plan could end up harming mergers and acquisitions on Wall Street, squashing hopes of a recovery in dealmaking.', 'What’s happening: It’s been a rough few years for investment bankers. Goldman Sachs (GS) reported substantial drops in revenue last year as 2023 had some of the lowest M&A activity in a decade.', 'Dealmaking activity has dried up as executives have contended with recession fears, interest rates and geopolitical tensions.', 'Thankfully, some green shoots of recovery have been emerging.', '“While many of these headwinds will continue to impact decisions in 2024, and we can add upcoming elections and supply chain issues to the list, there are reasons to be optimistic for more deal making this year,” said Lucille Jones of LSEG Deals Intelligence.', 'A more stable economic climate, expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, pent up buyer demand and a red-hot US stock market have “made it easier for dealmakers to price, execute and plan their deals,” said Jones.', 'The bad news: Recent regulations and proposed budget cuts threaten to step on those green shoots before they’re able to flower.', 'Late last year, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice announced 11 new guidelines for mergers in the US. These guidelines were the biggest changes to the way US regulators review M&A in 40 years, said Mitch Berlin, a vice chair at EY.', 'He estimated that those changes could add an additional two to three months to merger timelines.', 'Now, a new threat has emerged.', 'The spending package signed into law by Biden provides $233 million to the antitrust division for enforcement, $45 million less than what the Congressional Budget Office estimated the agency would collect in fees this year.', 'The 20% cut could be substantial, especially given regulators’ “ambitious agenda” for oversight, said Berlin.', '“Regulatory risk remains a top headwind for 2024 — and it may have just picked up speed,” he said. “The House spending bills divert funding for the DOJ’s antitrust division, which could lead to even longer deal review timelines, especially on the heels of the new merger guidelines that put more deals under scrutiny.”', 'Berlin told CNN that he expects CEOs to “exercise prudence” with risk taking this year as a result.', 'The good news: Mergers and acquisitions worth a combined $522 billion were announced globally during the first two months of 2024, according to data from LSEG. That’s 75% more than the value recorded during the same period in 2023, which had the slowest annual start for deal making since 2009.', 'Nine megadeals, worth $10 billion each, were recorded in January and February. That’s equal to the all-time record set in 2018. They included huge deals such as Capital One’s $35.3 billion offer to take over Discover Financial Services and Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s $14 billion bid for Juniper Networks.', 'And while a budget cut could take some wind out of Wall Street’s sails, “CEOs’ confidence in the economy is on the upswing and they’re hungry for growth through M&A,” said Berlin.', 'Why it matters: Dealmaking isn’t just good for Wall Street. It’s good for Main Street, too.', '“M&A is a powerful tool to generate economic value and transform your business,” said Berlin. “It can lead to increased shareholder returns.”', 'But, he warned, adding uncertainty threatens to hinder dealmaking activity. “If companies find it harder to transact to transform, we risk seeing a slowdown in economic activity and innovation and missed opportunities in the marketplace.”', 'TikTok — and some of its users — are pulling out all the stops to contest a bill that could lead to a nationwide ban of the app, reports my colleague Brian Fung.', 'As House lawmakers prepare to vote on the bill Wednesday, TikTok is encouraging users to call their representatives with a full-screen notification about the legislation.

He was found dead after failing to appear.', 'When reached for comment regarding Barnett’s death, Boeing issued a statement saying, “We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.”', 'A statement from Charleston police indicated the department was aware the case has generated international attention, saying, “it is our priority to ensure that the investigation is not influenced by speculation but is led by facts and evidence.

This stance is not unique to this case but is a standard procedure we adhere to in order to preserve the integrity of active investigations.”', 'Barnett, a former quality manager who had worked at Boeing for decades, had “discovered clusters of metal slivers hanging over the wiring that commands the flight controls,” according to a 2019 New York Times report cited by CNN.', 'Barnett told the Times that if those “sharp” slivers “penetrated” the wiring, the result could be “catastrophic.”', '“As a quality manager at Boeing, you’re the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public,” Barnett told the Times. “And I haven’t seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I’d put my name on saying it’s safe and airworthy.”', 'In a statement sent to the plant’s employees and provided to CNN at the time, Brad Zaback, a site leader at the plant and general manager of the 787 program, said the Times’ report “paints a skewed and inaccurate picture of the program and of our team (at the plant).”', 'Zaback, who said the Times declined an invitation to visit the plant, said “quality is the bedrock of who we are,” adding that the plant delivers “the highest quality airplanes.”', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

But it’s not a true competition. Boeing’s main customers are airlines, which can’t suddenly switch to Airbus if they’re upset with Boeing. Pilots are certified in one or the other, so once you make your choice, you’re pretty much stuck with it.', 'Given Boeing’s singular importance in the American aviation industry, it is the definition of Too Big to Fail.

You can skip ahead and take a look at more stocks that made our list by jumping straight to the top 5 biggest stocks targeted by activist investors right now."", 'Activist investing seems to be on the rise, with the number of campaigns up by 7% in the year at 252, according to Lazard. Region-wise, a record-breaking number of campaigns was registered in Europe, 69, followed by 44 campaigns waged by activist investors in the Asia-Pacific region.', 'Interestingly enough, last year we saw some of the biggest companies being targeted by activist investors. Even tech behemoth Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was not spared, as billionaire Chris Hohn, the founder of TCI Fund Management, issued a letter in January 2023, requesting job cuts. In the letter, Hohn, whose fund holds a $6 billion position in Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), said that the company needed to cut 20% of its workforce to bring back the employment levels to those in 2021.', 'Paul Singer of Elliott Management', ""Many other large-cap companies came on the radars of activist investors, with some companies targeted by several activists at once. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) saw a swarm of five activists surrounding it. More specifically, Dan Loeb's Third Point, Mason Morfit-led ValueAct Capital, Jeff Ubben's Inclusive Capital, Paul Singer's Elliott Management, and Jeffrey Smith's Starboard Value, approached Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) over the first half of 2023, as the company's stock was dwindling. Activists pushed Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)'s management for changes and they succeeded, as the stock recovered following some overhauls."", 'Overall, activists seem to be more eager to go after larger companies. SquareWell Partners estimated that between January 2022 and June 2023, activist campaigns targeted 13 large-cap companies, which represents a substantial increase from four companies in the previous two years. This trend might persist this year as well, as our research of largest companies that have been targeted by activist investors in recent weeks already shows eight companies with a market cap above $10 billion, and the top 5 biggest stocks targeted by activists are companies with a market cap above $50 billion.', 'Activist investors are a very interesting group to follow when looking for stock picks. These investors usually take a position in companies and engage directly with their boards and management seeking changes to unlock shareholder value. This can involve anything from management changes and cost cuts to splitting the targeted company and the outright sale of the entire business.', 'But why is shareholder activism on the rise lately? Well, there are several reasons that can be highlighted. One is the cooldown of the global economy. Even though it seems the US economy might actually succeed to ""soft land"" as many experts predict, the economic growth still looks tepid and, other countries (see Germany) are heading towards a recession. In turn this means that companies are looking at slower revenue growth and more narrow bottom lines. According to FactSet, the blended annual earnings growth rate for the fourth quarter of 2023 is 1.6%, which is significantly lower than the 5-year average growth of 9.5%. This is based on data from S&P 500 companies that either reported their actual results by February 2 (around 46% of the companies) and estimates for companies that were yet to report their results.', 'In this environment, it\'s understandable why activist investors are seeking for companies to take some actions to improve profitability. The aforementioned Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) became targets of activist investors who demanded exactly that. Chris Hohn requested Google parent company Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to cut 20% of its workforce, but also said that the company needs to ""address excessive employee compensation,"" pointing out that the median salary in 2021 was $300,000. Regarding Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), one of the activists, Starboard Value, reportedly expressed displeasure at the company\'s expenses. Moreover, reports allege that many investors (potentially including activists) are disappointed about the integration of the workplace messaging app Slack, which was acquired in 2021 for nearly $28 billion, and might be questioning whether it needs to be sold.', ""Another reason behind the growth of shareholder activism is the ascend of the so-called ESG investing. ESG, which stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance, is a fairly new trend, where investors buy shares of the company not just because of the company's value, but also because the company scores high on the ESG metrics. According to a survey conducted by deVere Group, 56% of polled investors, plan to increase their ESG-focused holdings this year. Amid this trend, some activist investors have positioned themselves as ESG-focused. For example, Jeff Ubben has left ValueAct and launched Inclusive Fund, a firm focused entirely on sustainable businesses. As you will see later on in our breakdown of biggest stocks targeted by activist investors, some companies made our list because they got on the radars of ESG investors."", 'Paul Singer of Elliott Management', 'Our Methodology', 'To identify the biggest stocks targeted by activist investors right now, we looked for companies that made the headlines in the context of renowned activist investors taking a position in the company in the recent weeks, or companies that were covered in the news in the context of recent activist campaign updates. We then ranked these companies based on their latest market capitalization.', 'Market Cap: $8.57 billion', ""Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY)'s stock has been underperforming lately, dropping by 30% over the last year. During the fourth-quarter earnings call, the company's CEO Josh Silverman highlighted macroeconomic headwinds as impacting the company, but also adding that their belief is that this is a temporary situation."", '""But this is a time when I think products that are not the cheapest possible are out of favor. And I don’t think that’s forever. When I imagine, going forward, does everyone always wants the cheapest version of any given product? No, absolutely not. I think that that trend, this is a cycle, we’re in a moment in the cycle, and I think we’ll move to better moments in the cycle, hopefully, soon,"" Silverman said.', 'In the meantime, Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY) found itself in the cross-hairs of activist investor Paul Singer, whose fund Elliott Management owns 1.90 million shares as of the end of December. Not only did Elliott acquire a position in the company, but as of the beginning of February, the investor also obtained board representation. Marc Steinberg, an Elliott partner, upon joining the board, said in a press release that he believes that Etsy provides an opportunity for value creation and he will be working with the board and management to improve customer experience, accelerate growth and drive value over the long run.', ""At the end of December, there were 32 funds in our database bullish on Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY), unchanged over the quarter. Among these funds, the top shareholder is Brian Bares' Bares Capital Management, which holds 4.08 million shares."", 'Market Cap: $9.09 billion', ""In addition to adding Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY) to its equity portfolio during the fourth quarter, Elliott Management also acquired a position in Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH), a company that owns dating platform Tinder. In its latest 13F filing, Elliott reported holding 3.0 million shares of Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH), although reports in January indicated that Elliott's stake could be as high as 9.5% of the company. However, Elliott has not yet announced any plans regarding its investment in the company."", ""Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH)'s stock has been losing ground, having declined by 80% since 2021. For the fourth quarter, the company posted EPS of $1.08 and its revenue of $866.23 million, an increase of 10.19% on the year. During the earnings call, CEO Bernard Kim said that in 2024, Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH) plans to leverage AI to enhance the user experience for its Tinder platform."", 'Market Cap: $11.26 billion', 'During the fourth quarter, Dallas-based Anson Fund acquired a fairly small position in cloud communications company Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO), having reported ownership of 440,540 shares plus Call options, in its latest 13F filing. Nevertheless, the fund took an activist stance towards the company and has already claimed a victory. In January, Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO) CEO Jeff Lawson stepped down and resigned from the Board of Directors. Anson Funds, together with Legion Capital, which holds 601,050 shares, as of the end of December, have been pressuring company for over a year to divest assets in order to boost shareholder value, according to reports.', 'Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO)\'s stock slid by more than 80% over the last three years amid disappointing performance and currently represents one of the best beaten-down stocks to buy right now. During the fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Khozema Shipchandler pointed out that its Twilio Segment business continued to underperform and the company had been conducting an operational review of the segment. When asked whether the conclusion of the review might result in a sale of the segment, Shipchandler said that they are approaching the review ""with an open mind.""', ""At the end of December, there were 47 funds tracked by Insider Monkey bullish on Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO), up by four funds over the quarter. Among these investors, David Blood And Al Gore's Generation Investment Management is the top shareholder with a stake comprising 8.50 million shares."", 'Market Cap: $15.50 billion', 'Next in our list of biggest stocks targeted by activist investors is Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB), a $15.5 billion a technology company that supports a number of industries, including construction, agriculture, natural resources, and utilities. In December, Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB) got in the cross-hairs of activist investor Barry Rosenstein, whose fund Jana Partners acquired a new position containing 3.76 million shares during the fourth quarter. When disclosing the position, Jana Partners said they would request the company to halt acquisitions and focus on organic growth and improving margins. In January, Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB) announced a buyback worth $800 million and added two new board members.', ""At the end of December, there were 29 funds with long positions in Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB), up by three over the quarter. Besides Jana Partners, other funds bullish on the company include Generation Investment Management and Robert Joseph Caruso's Select Equity Group, which own 12.27 million shares and 6.24 million shares, respectively."", 'Market Cap: $21.52 billion', ""Illumina, Inc.

One of these investors is Carl Icahn's Icahn Capital, which owns 430,000 shares, according to its latest 13F filing. Another activist investor that acquired shares of Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is Keith Meister's Corvex Capital, which holds 730,084 shares. Icahn has been after Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) for awhile, but in December, the investor said it planned to oust the board. Previously, the activist had been criticizing the acquisition of cancer test maker Grail and in December Illumina, Inc.

First, it is the largest producer of construction aggregates in the U.S. Notably, the company holds the number one or two position in over 90% of its markets.', 'Secondly, the bulky nature of aggregates makes it an extremely localized business.

CI provides pharmacy services, benefits management, care solutions, as well as data and analytics. These services are used by health plans, employers, healthcare providers and government organizations.', 'Courtesy of solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is worth adding at the moment.', 'Let’s delve deeper.', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cigna’s 2024 earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at $28.34, indicating a 13% year-over-year rise.

Its divestments are targeted to reduce less profitable assets and improve returns. Given its ROA, the company has room to improve operational efficiency and optimize assets. Also, its high debt level, with a net debt to capital of 28.7% (against the industry average of 17.8%), can lead to growing interest expenses.

Most of all in Europe. With war returning to the continent after decades of peace, countries in the region are racking up their defenses amid the turmoil in their neighborhood. French officials are considering increasing the size of the country’s reserve force, while the government in Poland has announced to recruit 150,000 additional troops over the next decade to take its number of active military personnel beyond the 300,000 mark. On the other hand, Sweden has decided to involve its society as a whole for national security, and formed a civil defense force.', 'Defense expenditure is also on the rise in Europe, with the continent in 2022 witnessing its steepest rise in military spending in three decades. According to a recent report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), arms exports by European countries have grown 94% between 2014-2018 and 2019-2023. The United States was the origin of 55% of all arms imported by European countries in the last five years, which resulted in a 17% increase in its arms exports compared to 2014-2018.', 'The spike in military spending has meant a boom for the defense industry. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) generated $67.6 billion in revenue in 2023, which was 2.4% higher than the previous year.

With a $158 billion backlog and almost 30% of its revenue coming from building F-35 aircraft with deliveries forecast to reach 180 per year (up from 141 in 2022) in the coming years, we believe the company could grow at a higher rate than overall defense budget growth and Street expectations over the next several years.

Instead of relying on expensive and high-profile celebrity and athlete endorsements, Lululemon's advertising strategy focuses on community-driven and grassroots marketing. This approach has transformed the business from a seller of popular yoga pants for women into a well-regarded athleisure pioneer."", ""There's a huge difference between the distribution strategies of Nike and Lululemon. The latter benefits by not relying on third-party retailers or wholesale accounts. Instead, Lululemon generates 41% of revenue from its website, with the rest coming from its 686 company-owned stores.

If you would like to skip our discussion on the US economy, you can go to the 5 Best States To Live In: 2024 Rankings.', ""With a population of around 334 million, the United States offers an outstanding quality of life and excels in various dimensions of this metric, according to the OECD. The country has above-average scores in income, employment, education, social connections, life satisfaction, and environmental quality. In terms of the economy, the US performed well in 2023, achieving a GDP growth rate of 2.5%, surpassing other G7 nations. This performance can be attributed to the strong structural fundamentals and effective policy responses by the USA. However, economic growth is anticipated to slow down in 2024 due to the impact of monetary policy. Meanwhile, inflation, a major concern in 2023, is expected to decrease to 2.4% in 2024, though still exceeding the Federal Reserve's target. The average household disposable income per capita and the average household net wealth in the US stand\xa0at $51,147 annually and $684,500 per year, respectively. This is much higher than the OECD average."", ""In 2023, the United States maintained a low unemployment rate, reaching an unprecedented low of 3.7% in December 2023. This indicates a tight labor market characterized by strong job creation. However, projections for 2024 suggest a cooling off of the labor market. The country's labor participation rate, standing at 67%, signifies the percentage of the working-age population either employed or actively seeking employment. The rate is higher than the OECD average of 66%. The US also has a robust education system. There is easy access to education, which can be judged by the fact that 92% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education. Along with this, the country is home to some of the most esteemed educational institutions in the world, such as Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology."", 'While the nation has undeniable strengths, the multifaceted nature of quality of life reveals certain disparities and challenges. Disparities also exist among states for various metrics; for instance, the cheapest states to live in may not necessarily be the best states for starting a family due to lower rankings in education and health facilities. In terms of health, the United States, while having a higher life expectancy than some other countries, has experienced stagnation in this metric over the years, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control. Despite the presence of healthcare facilities, millions of Americans remain without health insurance, even with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Ongoing efforts to expand access or introduce a single-payer system face political resistance. Additionally, medical expenses pose a significant burden for many Americans, with high insurance premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs creating financial strain and limiting access to quality care. Healthcare companies such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc.

These ratings were then multiplied by assigned weights, reflecting the importance of each factor, to calculate weighted average scores. The weights assigned to each metric were as follows: Economy, Education, and Safety at 15%, Financial Stability, Infrastructure, and Health Care at 14%, and Natural Environment at 13%.

These devices can collect, and more importantly, exchange data with each other and central systems over the internet. They gather information to make decisions and interact with the physical world and digital systems.\xa0', ""The IoT market is one of the fastest-growing ones globally. Growth is propelled by an increased demand for automation and an increasing need for big data for data management. Research and cloud computing platforms are also driving the growth of IoT. In addition, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are also pushing the market's growth. Its market size, which was $328.6 billion in 2022, is projected to reach $2,703 billion by 2032. The global IoT market will experience a compounding annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.46% during this forecast period. Currently, the North American region has the largest market share at 33%.\xa0\xa0"", 'The IoT market is segmented by components, deployment, organization size, platform, technology, and industry verticals. The software segment has the largest share when segmented according to component. The cloud segment leads in the deployment segmentation, whereas the enterprise segment has the largest share when segmented according to organization size. In addition, the network communication segment has the largest market share when segmented according to technology.\xa0', ""IoT devices often rely on ML and AI to carry out their tasks. Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Echo devices are an example of IoT devices that use AI to enhance their capabilities. These devices are smart speakers that come with Amazon's voice assistant, Alexa. Recently, Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) has made many AI-related enhancements to Alexa to give it a more opinionated personality. These enhancements also give it the ability to adjust tone and response to express emotions.\xa0"", 'More recently, generative AI like ChatGPT has gained the attention of tech giants like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG), among others. The AI market is currently in the stage of maturation and has significant opportunities for real-world application. It has a positive long-term growth outlook, and these tech giants are looking to cash in on this opportunity.\xa0', 'The global AI market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19% during the forecast period of 2022-2023.

However, the Asia Pacific region is expected to expand the highest during this forecast period with a CAGR of 20.3%.\xa0', 'The AI market can be segmented according to technology, solution, and end user. Technology-wise, deep learning has the largest share. The services segment takes the lead when segmented according to the solution. When segmented according to end users, banking, financial services & insurance (BSFI) takes the lead.', ""\xa0AI's flexibility and adaptability are driving its growth. Some of the areas where it is being increasingly used are life-saving medical devices and self-driving features in electric cars. This growth is also propelled by an increasing investment from top tech giants such as Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM), and Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) for the upgradation and development of various applications of AI. One of the supplier-side factors driving the growth of AI is the vendor and end-user industries' partnership to enhance reach. An example of such a partnership is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Intelligent Network's collaboration with LV Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad, India to incorporate machine learning and bring data-driven eye care services to India.\xa0"", 'Artificial intelligence is also causing disruption left and right. A startup founded by an ex-Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa scientist is looking to disrupt the investment industry through AI. Theia Insights recently raised $6.5 million.

IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s diabetic eye disease detection technology is found to be 86% accurate in classifying the severity of the disease across the five levels recognized on the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Scale.\xa0"", ""One of the ongoing trends in AI is experimentation in advertising. AI giants such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Co-pilot, open AI's Chat GPT, and Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google Gemini are experimenting with ads so they could solve the monetization issue of generative AI. Most people are not willing to spend $20 every month for premium generative AI models such as GPT-4. So, ads could soon take over chatbots, which would provide these companies with a more viable revenue model. This is already been done by Adzedek which introduces itself as an AI chatbot advertising market palace. The company lets brands run sponsored ads in its custom chatbots, the revenue of which is shared between Adzedek and the chatbot creator.\xa0"", ""There is severe competition within the AI industry which also comes from new entrants. A Palo Alto-based startup by the name of Inflection AI has developed a generative chatbot that is considered as powerful as the GPT-4 model, especially across STEM subjects. This Inflection AI model is currently powering Pi, Inflection AI's voice assistant.

Specialists in data analytics play a crucial role in both streamlining the process of feeding new data into the AI engines and empowering organizations to make data-driven business decisions.', ""On that note, let me show you two fantastic investment opportunities in today's data analytics industry. Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) is an innovative market darling with room to grow. IBM (NYSE: IBM) is an old-school tech titan with a new lease on life in the AI era."", 'Data analytics expert Palantir is not a cheap stock. The share price has more than tripled over the last year and Palantir trades at nearly 300 times trailing earnings or 27 times sales.', ""With these lofty valuation ratios, one might expect Palantir to a small-cap start-up with skinny profit margins supported by modest yet skyrocketing sales. But its annual sales passed the $2 billion benchmark last year and Palantir's net profit margin stands at a robust 9%. The year-over-year revenue growth stopped at 17% in 2023, down from 24% in 2022 and 41% before that."", 'Yet, Palantir has earned its nosebleed-inducing valuation by plotting a clear path to continued growth.', 'The company started as a specialist in defense solutions. That\'s still an important business but Palantir is expanding its reach to commercial clients, too. Commercial sales are growing faster than government revenues, accounting for 45% of total sales last year. And the shift is accelerating right now. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2024, Palantir\'s management expects total revenues to increase by roughly 20%. However, U.S. commercial sales should lead the charge with a jump of ""at least 40%.""', ""Keep in mind that government contracts often come with lower profit margins than business-to-business services, and you're looking at a promising recipe for profitable growth. Palantir's business is expanding in a more lucrative direction, as the company becomes a leading provider of AI-based data analytics tools. Yes, AI analytics can optimize the data feed that becomes the next generation of machine learning or large language model (LLM) AI platforms."", ""Palantir's commitment to advancing AI and machine learning innovation places it at the forefront of analytics technology, enhancing its platforms with AI-driven insights and predictive analytics. This commitment not only enriches its service offerings but also lets clients make the most of their data in sophisticated and impactful ways. The scalability of Palantir's solutions makes defense-quality data analytics available to anyone, letting organizations of any size benefit from the company's cutting-edge AI technology."", 'Through these strategic advantages, Palantir Technologies has carved out a leading position in the data analytics and AI sector, demonstrating a clear path for continued growth and innovation. So the stock may be expensive, but for all the right reasons. The company should grow into its roomy boots over time, supporting its market value with stronger profits and continued top-line growth.', 'Big Blue rarely shows up in the AI conversation, and since most investors prefer to focus on newer and fresher names. A shorter operating history can be OK as long as the growth story looks good, right?', ""Well, good old IBM actually combines the best qualities of an experienced tech giant and an exciting AI expert. The company is entering an impressive growth phase, powered by cloud computing and AI services, that should drive sales and free cash flows dramatically higher over the next few years. But most investors haven't noticed this unstoppable growth spurt yet, so the stock trades at the modest valuation ratios of 24 times earnings and 2.9 times sales."", ""If Palantir's valuation is too rich for your blood, IBM could be the value-priced AI investment you're looking for."", ""And AI-assisted data analytics play a massive part in IBM's future growth story. It's anchored by the powerful Watson AI platform, and its data analytics services are a cornerstone of IBM's offerings in the cutting-edge technology landscape."", 'Watson AI uses advanced machine learning and natural language processing to analyze vast data sets, enabling businesses to uncover insights, predict outcomes, and make data-driven decisions with unprecedented accuracy and speed.', ""That sounds a lot like Palantir, but it's not the whole story. Beyond this fundamental analytical prowess, Watson's applications span a broad range of industry-specific features. In healthcare, it assists in diagnosing diseases and recommending treatments. In finance, IBM's Watson enhances risk management and customer service. And that's just a fleeting glance at a robust sector-spanning portfolio."", ""IBM complements Watson's AI capabilities with a robust suite of analytics tools and cloud services. Together, these tools provide a comprehensive ecosystem that supports the entire data lifecycle from collection and storage to analysis and visualization. This holistic approach helps clients leverage their data to the max, driving innovation and efficiency across their operations."", ""Investors started to open their eyes to IBM's AI-driven prospects around January's earnings report. The stock has gained 20% in three months and 30% in half a year, but IBM's shares are still cheap in comparison to other AI investments. If you don't have any Big Blue shares in your portfolio yet, this would be a good time to grab a few shares on the cheap. I don't know how much longer the bargain-bin stock price will last."", ""If you believe in the transformative power of AI and data analytics, both Palantir and IBM deserve a spot on your watchlist. The market's always evolving, and sometimes the best moves are made when others aren't paying attention."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

DEO remains on track to surpass its three-year productivity savings target of $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2024.Additionally, the company’s endeavors, including premiumization efforts, disciplined cost management, pricing actions and supply productivity savings, appear encouraging. It is confident about the long-term potential of the total beverage alcohol sector and expects to expand its value share by 50% in the sector to 6% by 2030.However, Diageo has been witnessing inflation in commodity costs, mainly related to increased prices for glass, paper, metal, and higher energy and transportation costs. Also, elevated inventory levels in LAC have been denting the company’s performance.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 3.2% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s decline of 2%.', '\xa0', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Diageo is expected to continue benefiting from its diversified footprint, advantaged portfolio, strong brands, pricing initiatives, and productivity savings. The company’s improved price/mix partly aided results in the first half of fiscal 2024 despite soft volume. The higher price/mix mainly resulted from price increases across all regions, supported by the company’s efficient product portfolio.In the first half of fiscal 2024, the company reported a 4.6% improvement in the price/mix, driven by growth across all regions, except for Latin America and the Caribbean (“LAC”). Price contribution to organic net sales was in the low to mid-single digits, driven by price increases, which helped mitigate the impacts of cost inflation and protect margins.In the first half of fiscal 2024, the price/mix grew 1% year over year in North America, 7% in Europe, 8% in the Asia Pacific and 9% in Africa, mainly on price increases. However, the price/mix declined 4% in LAC, driven by higher trade investment to manage inventory toward suitable levels for the current macroeconomic environment, and consumer downtrading. Backed by pricing gains and excluding LAC, the company’s net sales grew 0.7% and organic net sales rose 2.5% in the first half of fiscal 2024.Diageo is progressing well with its new productivity commitment to deliver $2 billion of productivity savings over three years (from fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2027), as announced at the Capital Markets Event in November 2023. Per the plan, the company expects to deliver accelerated productivity commitment across the cost of goods, marketing spends and overheads.The company plans to support this acceleration through investments, including its supply-chain agility program announced in July 2022. It expects benefits from the supply-chain agility program to increase from fiscal 2025 and accelerate in the following years.Notably, the company earned an additional $335 million of productivity cost savings in cost of goods, marketing expenses and overheads in the first half of fiscal 2024. It remains on track to surpass its three-year productivity saving target of $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2024.', 'Diageo suffers from persistent inflationary pressures, induced by higher commodity costs, particularly agave, energy expenses and supply disruptions. As a substantial portion of Diageo’s business comes from international operations, exchange rate fluctuations have been hampering its sales for a while.The company’s gross profit declined 1.8% year over year in the first half of fiscal 2024, mainly owing to cost pressures. Productivity savings, supply efficiencies and pricing actions offset the absolute impacts of cost inflation. The significant cost pressure in the first half of fiscal 2024 mainly related to increased glass, paper, metal and transportation costs.Moreover, Diageo witnessed significant impacts in the first half of fiscal 2024, backed by a substantially weak performance in LAC, which contributes 10% of its net sales. The fast-changing consumer sentiment and high inventory levels have significantly impacted the total business performance in the LAC region, which was identified at the end of fiscal 2023. The region has been pressured with excess inventory levels at its direct customers. Despite corrective measures, the elevated inventory levels impacted LAC’s performance in the first half of fiscal 2024.Diageo anticipates macroeconomic pressures in LAC to persist in the second half of fiscal 2024, which are likely to continue impacting inventory levels. Consequently, DEO expects organic net sales in LAC to decline 10-20% year over year in the second half of fiscal 2024.

Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook.

But Target (NYSE: TGT) investors have little to cheer about.', ""Management is keeping a lean inventory, anticipating low demand. Margins are strained. Target's confidence in consumer spending on discretionary goods is low."", 'The dividend yield is around 4%, and the company has raised its dividend for over 50 years, making it a Dividend King. The reliable passive income stream is about the only thing working for Target. Shares are around a three-year low. The stock is falling with no end in sight.', ""But then, something changed. In response to Target's third-quarter 2024 earnings report, the stock staged its largest one-day gain in four years. It didn't stop there."", 'Target\'s Q4 2024 earnings report on March 5 kicked the stock into a new gear. In the four-month period from Nov. 6, 2023, to March 6, 2024, Target is up a staggering 56.3% -- almost the same gain as red-hot Meta Platforms. Target looks more like a ""Magnificent Seven"" stock than a big box retailer.', ""Here's Target's story, why the stock has been an unbelievable turnaround play, and lessons you can learn to take advantage of similar sell-offs in the future."", 'Operating margins are the lifeblood of most companies -- but especially retailers.', ""Some companies go for a high-volume, low-margin strategy. Walmart's margin is usually around 4.5%. Costco Wholesale falls within the 3% to 3.5% range. However, high volume makes for overall successful businesses."", 'By comparison, high-end retailers, like Williams-Sonoma or RH, tend to have at least 10% margins but lower volume. The sweet spot is a balance between sales and profitability, managing discounts, seasonality, and consumer trends.', 'Target is somewhere in the middle, typically sporting a 7% to 8% operating margin. It has a more discretionary product mix than Walmart, but not as discretionary as companies like Williams-Sonoma or RH.', ""Target's margins fell off a cliff in 2022. The company was ill-prepared for high inflation. Its costs went up, and initially, it was unable to offset those costs because consumers were being selective. Target had to issue discounts to move inventory. It was a sloppy execution, and the stock suffered accordingly."", ""As you can see in the chart, Target's margins and earnings began improving in late 2022. But since Target had a long way to go to reach pre-pandemic profitability, as well as brand concerns, the market wasn't too optimistic about the stock."", ""Like Bud Light's parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Target got caught up in social media backlash last spring and summer. Many challenges compounded at once. Impatient investors dumped the stock. Those who believed in the long-term investment thesis and held on were handsomely rewarded."", ""The retailer's improving fundamentals drove a change in sentiment that ensured the stock's turnaround. It booked $2.98 in Q4 2023 earnings per share (EPS) -- 57.6% higher than Q4 2022 and above the forecasted range of $1.90 to $2.60."", ""Operating margins came in at 5.3% for the quarter, two percentage points higher than the same quarter last year. Just that small difference was enough to boost Target's operating income by nearly $2 billion."", ""Target improved its margins and lowered its inventory in Q3. That's when the turnaround began. Q4 proved that the turnaround was the real deal."", ""If you've listened to Target's earnings calls over the last few years, a major theme is growth in its Target Circle loyalty program, which is a direct way to engage customers with promotions through the Target app. Another theme is curbside pickup and delivery. For the most part, the results from Target Circle and non-in-store sales have been encouraging, even during the downturn. But investors were quick to dismiss these positive signs and get caught up in the negative narrative."", 'Now, sentiment has completely shifted. Target reported a 13.6% increase in same-day services (in-store pickup, curbside, and its Shipt service) for Q4 2023. These services now make up more than 10% of sales. That kind of news can throw fuel on a red-hot stock, which may be part of the reason Target keeps rallying. But just two quarters ago, I would guess the market would have largely ignored these stats.', ""If you were to look at Target's stock chart, you would think that the company was on the brink of disaster and then did something miraculous. The reality is that the investment thesis has stayed mostly the same for the last few years. There have been challenges and mistakes, points when Target stock deserved to fall but not collapse."", ""Overall, I'd argue that the investment thesis hasn't changed since 2017, when Target announced a $7 billion investment in digitalization and store renovations. That was a pivotal point in the investment thesis and marked a turning point for the brand. Since then, Target has built upon that investment and is being rewarded with increased engagement from its loyalty program and non-in-store sales. Target has proven its value and resilience to Amazon, which was once an existential threat."", 'Target is one of the best examples of the importance of understanding the difference between short-term challenges and factors that could break the investment thesis. It also shows how volatile even a generally safe stock can be and how a narrative can dominate the price action of a stock.', 'Target has raised its dividend for 52 consecutive years. But unlike some Dividend Kings that make bare minimum raises to keep the streak alive, Target has made some notable increases in recent years. In fact, the dividend is up 61.8% in the last three years!', ""Target sports a payout ratio of just 48.6%, which is impressive considering the size of the raises it has made. For comparison, Walmart has a payout ratio of 39.6%, but it yields just 1.3% -- which is half as much as Target's 2.6% yield."", ""Target's dividend checks all the boxes -- the length of consecutive dividend raises, the size of the recent raises, a low payout ratio, and a quality yield."", ""So, what is a good price for Target? I would say that Target never deserved to fall as much as it did, but the tear it has been on for four months is also a little overdone. The key is not getting too caught up in either stage of the stock's performance -- the mighty collapse or the meteoric surge. Instead, it's better to find a point where you think Target is a good value."", 'Target is now at a 22.1 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, and the dividend yield is down to 2.6%. Maybe that is good enough for you. Others looking to buy the stock may want a higher yield or a better valuation.', ""Target is doing well, but the business isn't firing on all cylinders like the price action may lead you to believe. I wouldn't buy Target now. I think the stock is a better value around its 10-year median P/E of 17. For context, Target was a 14.2 P/E four months ago."", ""If you own shares in Target, it's fine to continue holding them. But just like it would have been unwise to get caught up in last year's sell-off, it could also be a mistake to become enamored with the market's recent infatuation with Target."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Target right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Target, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Target wasn’t one of them.

I think that the best has yet to come for these companies and investors who are seeking substantial dividend and income growth potential.

Investors could flock to them in pursuit of yield.', 'What’s better is these top REITs to buy also trade at very attractive valuations for the same reasons. These companies are still cheap, as most of the market has turned toward more attractive and riskier options such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) or other growth stocks in pursuit of capital appreciation.', 'So for those of you who want to scoop up some undervalued income-producing shares, here are three top REITs to buy for March this year.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'Prologis (NYSE:PLD) is the largest industrial and warehouse REIT, indirectly capitalizing on e-commerce growth.', 'In the fourth quarter of 2023, the company reported funds from operations (FFO) per share of $5.61, up 8.7% from the previous year.

Additionally, the company sustained an average occupancy level of 97.1% across its owned and managed portfolio during this period.', 'But looking ahead, it provided optimistic guidance, projecting core FFO per share in the range of $5.42 to $5.56. Plus, it has a consistent record of increasing its dividend, with a five-year annualized dividend growth rate of 13.6%.', 'The company’s dividend yield is around 2.9% at the time of writing.

I also think its a strong contender for one of those top REITs for investors to consider. Part of this thesis is due to its strong results in the previous quarter.

And as we explained on our quarterly calls throughout the year, the impact of these upgrades on our business were material and sometimes painful even if wholly necessary. We now enter 2024 on the backside of a number of important system migrations, capital equipment upgrades and with the new extract and ready to drink facility in Conway, Arkansas on schedule for delivery of our first commercially available products next month.

When we took the company public in August of 2022, we did so to reposition the company to capture the consumer shift to single serve coffee and cold coffee products. Our financial performance both in the fourth quarter and in our full year 2023 results continues to reflect this shift by the consumer and our work to capture it. In terms of our financial performance, company net sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $215 million compared to $227.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Consolidated gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $34.8 million and included $900,000 of non-cash mark-to-market losses compared to $34.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 that included $2.7 million of non-cash mark-to-market losses.', 'This drove consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $13.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $17.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The delta between these two numbers is almost entirely the result of a one-time compensation accrual reversal in the fourth quarter of 2022 that was not repeated in 2023. Adjusting for the accrual reversal, consolidated adjusted EBITDA would have been essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. In our Beverage Solutions segment in the fourth quarter, we continue to see strength in our single serve cup platform as well as our sales of flavors, extracts and ingredients, which grew 30%. This was partially offset by continued softness in our traditional roast and ground coffee business. In the fourth quarter of 2023, our Beverage Solutions segment contributed $175.1 million of net sales, which is a decrease of approximately 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.', 'Beverage Solutions gross profit was $31 million for the quarter, down 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA from our Beverage Solutions segment for the quarter was $11.7 million compared to $15.2 million for the prior year fourth quarter. This decline, as previously stated, was almost entirely the result of a onetime compensation accrual reversal in the fourth quarter of 2022 that was not repeated in fourth quarter 2023. In our Sustainable Sourcing and Traceability segment, we started to see a return to more normal operating results as sales net of intersegment revenues were $39.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA from our SS&T segment for the quarter was $2.1 million, which is $200,000 less than the prior year fourth quarter.', 'Turning to our annual results. For the full year 2023, total company net sales were $864.7 million which is essentially flat compared to the full year 2022. Consolidated gross profit for full year 2023 was $139.9 million and included $100,000 of non-cash mark-to-market gains. By comparison, consolidated gross profit for the full year 2022 was $152.8 million and included $3.5 million of non-cash mark-to-market losses. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in 2023 was $45.1 million compared to $60.1 million for the prior year. For 2023, our Beverage Solutions segment contributed $722.9 million of net sales, which is an increase of approximately 5% compared to the prior year.

Adjusted EBITDA from our SS&T segment for the year was $3.5 million compared to $6.1 million for the prior year. Moving on to our capital expenditures. During the fourth quarter, we deployed approximately $43 million of CapEx, primarily related to our Conway extract and RTD facility. With respect to Conway, we now expect our total CapEx spend to settle around $315 million and as we ended 2023, we had already spent approximately $155 million of that amount. Our largest outlays of capital expenditures on the facility will take place over the next 6 months and then we'll start to see that spending step down in the back half of this year."", 'At quarter end, we had approximately $147 million of consolidated unrestricted cash and undrawn revolving credit commitments. Our consolidated net leverage ratio at December 31, 2023 was 4.4x based on fourth quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA. As previously disclosed, we recently issued $72 million of convertible notes, which mature in February of 2029. The notes, combined with covenant flexibility included as part of our recent credit agreement amendment, will allow us to fund the Conway facility expansion and our investment in the Select Milk joint venture. We believe that these are key investments that position Westrock to capitalize on the expanding customer demand for RTD products. Turning to our outlook for 2024, as noted in our business update in February, we expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA to be between $60 million and $80 million for fiscal 2024.', ""This guidance range is necessarily broad to account for the range of results we may experience as we begin operations in our new extract and RTD facility and the commercialization of customers in that facility.

We are also turning the page on an ERP conversion and single serve scale up that pressured our 2023 results in the first half of the year. The business is off to a solid start in 2024 and we're pleased with our performance thus far in the first quarter with our adjusted EBITDA results coming in line with our expectations."", ""Given the wide range of adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year, which is largely determined by the ramp and commercialization of our Conway facility, we'll continue to update you on the progress and how it may impact our outlook for the year.

(Operator Instructions) Todd Brooks, The Benchmark Company.', 'Todd Brooks', ""Hey, thanks for taking my question and good to talk to you all. Couple of questions about Conway in the release and Scott, you talk to this and you detailed both plural customers and plural products on commercialization that will hit in April, if I'm remembering correctly, that's actually a month or two ahead of schedule for what we had been talking about. Sokudos on that, but are there any details you can tell us about from these initial commercializations and any early looks into how and no pun intended fluidly the customer acceptance program is going with the with the new facility?"", 'Scott Ford', ""Sure, hey Todd. So the good news is we are we are ahead of schedule on every one of the line installation projects, and we also have good news in that we have a number of customers that are in commercialization in the commercialization process. Now there are windows across. So when we talk about the various product packaging format, glass bottle can or multi-serve bottles, coal to the coal route. We have commercialization projects going on all three of them. There's a sequential startup, the multi-serve bottles coming on. First, I can't comment on second, the last line is coming on third and we are about two months ahead of schedule on every one of those physical installs, which allows us. I don't know that it's going to get any more product in through the pipeline in the year '24, but it allows us the opportunity to maybe to maybe be able to do that. And if it were if we stay on this schedule and everybody commercializes in their window and stays on time and wants us to ramp it up faster, we can be at the high end of our range. If everybody kind of goes back to normal pace, we ought to be at the middle part of our range. That's how we built the EBITDA forecast for this next year."", 'Todd Brooks', ""Okay. That's helpful detail. I know you said MultiServ First, any detail on the type of customers that we should be watching for and win that April delivery turns into product on the shelf."", 'Scott Ford', ""So that should turn into product on the shelf in the early summer as they hit large retailer resets. I don't want to go into who it is. But obviously these are large. These are large leading brands in the coffee space that are rolling ready to drink out in various form factors. And this is some of them that we're doing for."", 'Todd Brooks', ""Okay, great. And then my final question, I'll jump back in queue. You talked about the pace of commercialization defining where you fall in the $60 million to $80 million guidance range. I want to strip out FE and I have talk about both single serve, which there was a tough first half with the equipment delays last year and then roast and ground where we're really site kind of seen a little bit of a collapse in customer demand here in the second half of this year. Within that $60 million to $80 million guidance on there will be variability around FP. and I. commercialization. But what are the thoughts and variability around contributions that you're expecting from single-serve and restaurant brands. Thanks."", 'Scott Ford', 'Do you want to take that? (multiple speakers)', 'Chris Pledger', ""I think this is Chris. In terms of in terms of how we how we built our outlook for 2024, we looked at what was the run rate of the business as we got to the back half of the year. And then we look at what are the customer wins that we have that that are that are coming online in 2024. And so that's what helped really inform the bottom part of our range. And so we feel we feel good about the run rate, as Scott talked about in his comments as we as we exit 2023, we feel good about kind of that based on the base business, being able to get to the bottom end of our range. And then what we do after that is really Conway dependent."", 'Todd Brooks', 'Okay, great. Thanks, Chris.', 'Scott Ford', 'Much smarter answer. Yeah.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Ben Bienvenu, Stephens, Inc.', 'Ben Bienvenu', ""Good afternoon. I wanted to ask as it relates to the ramping of the Conway facility and recognizing the inherent variability in how your customers choose to commercialize. To what degree can you shepherd that onboarding such that you don't end up with a Russian volume in more concentrated windows, kind of increasing the risk of ramping smoothly versus helping to gate the process to scale up as ratably as you're able? And while I recognize there's a significant ramp."", 'Scott Ford', ""Yes, it's a super question. It's obviously one that reflects you've been through this before of what we are doing to trying to mitigate the rush for the door is we are actually committing to production based on when people come in for commercialization. And so we have kind of force rank if you really wanted an X timeframe, you've got to come to commercialization now and of for our outlet McCollam, our anchor tenants, they have their own process. That's all part of the contract of their anchor tenant relationship with us. But when we start talking about the dozen others that are trying to come through the door right now on the commercialization. We actually are lining that up with production. And if they come, they get production in their window, if they need to wait and delay them their production window slides out to. And that's been a great clarifier of the importance of hitting your window when it's available for the commercialization side, for the brands, all of them. They're like us. Nobody wants to spend any money until you have to, and nobody was doing anything until you have to. But if you do want to hit a reset window with your retail customers, then you've got to have production. And if you're going to have production, you've got to be in your commercialization window. And that was the only way we could kind of bring some ramp up, walk through that people could actually do to what would otherwise be a very chaotic rush for the door as you clearly understand. So that's what we're doing. Whether that works exactly right or not. We don't know which is why we've offered the guidance that says we know what the base business is capable of doing. We don't quite know how that will all flow through. We're going to give you some guesses and the range around it and as Chris laid out very smartly and I think that captures the same story."", 'Ben Bienvenu', ""Yes. Okay. Thanks, Scott. Chris, as we think about margins through the year, recognizing mix and utilization will be a really important factor. Should we think of the range of outcomes for margins being such that if the ramp happens faster, could there be margin pressure actually, is there a fixed cost deleveraging for us to consider? Or are you adding equipment as the commercialization happens and you have what is a shell today help us think in our mind's eye, what that process looks like and what the implications for margins are?"", 'Chris Pledger', ""As we in terms of in terms of Conway, we I mean, we have the expense turning on in sequence with the with the ramp. And so I don't expect the ramp of Conway really to create margin compression that you take on the fixed cost that they've been about how that's going how that's going to kind of sequence itself out. In terms of kind of product mix and margin improvement. I think you're going to continue to see growth in our single serve which is the higher-margin part of our business. We're going to continue to see F&I growth in kind of our base business with extracts. I think there were 30% up in the fourth quarter. And then we start layering on the products for Con-Way that come on in. We start selling them in April and the volumes really start to ramp in the back half of the year and you're going to continue to see growth from that."", 'Ben Bienvenu', 'Okay, great. Thanks so much.', 'Chris Pledger', 'Yep.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Matt Smith, Stifel.', 'Matt Smith', 'Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to ask when we consider cash flow in 2025, you talked about Con-way being about a $355 million capital investment, that implies $200 million or so to go. Should we think of that being spent in the first half and then a moderating level of spend in the second half. Preproduction costs were about $5 million in the fourth quarter. Should that continue at a similar level in the first half, or does that step down is commercially saleable product production begins in April.', 'Chris Pledger', ""But I think in terms just to make sure we're talking about the same numbers from the Conway CapEx, and we expect that to $315 million.

And the preproduction cost should those continue to persist through the first half of this year or now that you're producing salable product beginning in April, did those start to tail off."", 'Chris Pledger', 'The they start to pay base stations start to tail off.', 'Scott Ford', ""But right now is the preproduction and timely itself is go into the balance sheet hassle. And it was not released on a pro rata basis over the next two years as the volume builds, which was the comment Chris was making about the margins of into either, I think to Ben's question a minute ago."", 'Chris Pledger', 'Correct.', 'Matt Smith', 'Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And just one more you talked about a new approach in pricing in the roast and ground business. Can you talk about that a little more? I know previously pricing was more of a pass through as you locked in green coffee costs for your customers. It sounds like that may be changing.', 'Scott Ford', ""It's actually not the structure of the contract, which I would say is what you're referring to there. We're not changing the structure of the contract, what we've been doing as part of the modernization of the roast and ground coffee business. And these are the plants that are in North Carolina that we acquired a few years ago. We are in the middle of a massive well. We have just finished a massive systems rebuild and as systems rebuild has allowed us to get to a level of cost and transparency by machine by operator by shift that was not available previously. So that kind of a data system installation, which has been unbelievably burdensome to the operations to current financial operations of '23 suffered because we had to slow down drag out, rebuild, turn lines off, get this automation in well as we've had it running now for about the last, I'd say, five or six months. Our ability to clearly see exactly where our costs are not on an average basis, not on an average basis across products, not on an average basis across line on an average basis across customers, but specifically to the detail of the various skew running on that line with that operator and that shift. And when we are able to do that, we are able to better price. Sometimes we are able to give lower prices to our customers, lower conversion through the contract formula that you talked about. And sometimes we require higher because we realize that's actually a pinch point in the market where we need to charge more just given the demand and that specific skew in that specific slide slot. And so that ability to get really honed in on our cost has allowed us to go customer by customer. You've asked you and rationalized the price to the right point, higher or lower. And that's the methodology that Chris is talking about. And it's all brought about its work. It is worth several large wins to us already in '24 that are coming our way. And those large wins helped fill a high fixed costs throughput based set of facilities and that that all hinged from the decisions we made to if we're going to have a bad year and '23 have a bad year in '23 and do all the work so that when you turn on Con-Way in '24 and '25, you catch everybody asleep at how powerful the earnings can be off of this business. That's our whole strategy over the next two years."", 'Matt Smith', ""Thank you, Scott. I'll leave it there and pass it on."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Sarang Vora, Telsey Group. Please go ahead, surveying.', 'Sarang Vora', ""The Thank you. I'll just ask a question on Conway as well. When you look at the picture, it's great to see the facility opening in April, it is a three year progress for you on the production side. So when you look at the facility and you know your plans for how you plan to open on different production lines. Can you help us understand a little differently saying how much of the plant we'll be operating in '24 of, you know, will you be like about 70% running on Conway by like, you know, '25. And then, you know, the other 30% opens in, like, you know, fully operational by end of '26. I'm just trying to see like how the production ramps up over a three year period from Conway?"", 'Scott Ford', ""Yes, terrific. Question. One that we spend a lot of time on ourselves. Let me attempt to answer it this way. This might be my I hope this is helpful. And Pledger, you can clean this up if I get it wrong and like you can go file an 8-K upon step too far over. What is the best way to understand calmly is that it is a two year onboarding, but whatever you can get onboarded in '24 essentially becomes full run rate in '25. So we are better to commercialize. This goes back to the to the question that Ben asked a minute ago, we are better to commercialize more customers in '24 and slow production to just meet meeting our contractual commitments in '24 so that we get everybody lined up to run in full in '25. And so if you go through the way that Chris laid out, the way we built are our forecast, it probably comes in at the low end of Conway and '24 because we we've commercialized more and we get everybody ready to run in late '24 and '25 instead of picking up a $10 million or $20 million of EBITDA, you can pick up $50 million to $70 million of EBITDA from the customers that are already in the door. And all we have to do is sit there and run the machines. And when you put that on top of the core business that Chris talked about at $60 million, you can see why people when they look at you while this business could generate if we can just commercialize in '24, this business can generate $125 million of EBITDA in '25 if we don't make a single additional sale. The power that has been built up in the last two years while we suffered in and spent the money to take plants off-line to get them automated and get the MIS system built in is really much more powerful than anything I've read about, but we'll just have to deliver that. And that's just one."", 'Sarang Vora', ""But that's so that's very helpful. I'll ask you about one more big initiative that you announced this quarter about the JV with select generic producer. Can you help us walk through like, you know, you know how this JV will work and I know you do the concentrate there to the mill, but then you know how the revenues kind of flow through your P&L. And now just help us a little bit more about the rationale of this JV and, you know, some of the operating things in this JV. Thank you."", 'Scott Ford', ""Yes, yes, sure. It's a 50%, 50% JV, we are each going to put money up to capitalize it. The JV itself will then go borrow money to finish out the equipment and then that equipment will be put into a facility that Select is building and we will become a lease tenant of the select facility, if you will, the way that we will for the most part book revenues through is through the sale of extracts because that's the largest use product that we deliver out of this. And then there will be a conversion profit that will come out through the through the 50%, 50% JV, if you will. So you will see the extract sale come out of our on flavors, extracts and Ingredients division. And then you will also see in that same division, the pickup of our 50% interest in whatever the residual profitability is of the conversion work. And you'll see that come in at and above the EBITDA line. It's a very powerful earnings adder that we're on that were saving up for everybody in '26."", 'Sarang Vora', ""That's great. Thank you. Good luck."", 'Scott Ford', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Scott Ford for closing remarks.', 'Scott Ford', ""Well, thank you very much. We appreciate it, operator and gentlemen, thank you for getting on with your questions. Thank you for your interest. We are super excited and I'd just say that we were talking before the call started. There's not really any news in the release we put out because we told everybody this essentially exactly where we were two, three weeks ago. The news is we are off to a great start in '24 and the plans that we have for '24 through the commercialization and then monetizing some of that should give us a really good year and it's setting '25 up to be absolutely fantastic. And we've got to walk the walk, but we are we are months ahead of schedule on the physical side. Our customers are starting to match with us on the commercialization and product development work and we are super excited about getting that plant on. Meanwhile, back in the core business, we have been we've spent an enormous amount of time and energy and money and through lost EBITDA from taking things down and actually suffering through this, the windows of turning MIS systems up in the old business. All of that's going to come back on is coming back on now, and we're seeing it in our results now, and we're excited about it. And if people want to get on board with us, great. And if they want to bet against us and say, let's see you do it. Let's do that, too. I just a follow-up. So thanks for. Thanks for tuning in.

The economic uncertainty of 2024 has shifted the focus to rebuilding trust, making loyalty programs a core growth opportunity for retailers. Deloitte observed that a key strategy for 2024 is to reshape the loyalty landscape by prioritizing trust. Despite a high participation rate in loyalty programs, retailers struggle to convert members into active users. Studies show that customers in retail loyalty programs exhibit significantly higher trust in the brand, and increasing trust can potentially boost annual spending by 30%. The key drivers for profitable loyalty in 2024 include personalization, co-branding, and data monetization.', 'While the digital acceleration from the pandemic has improved online and omnichannel shopping experiences, in-store purchases remain the preferred engagement medium, despite showing the lowest trust scores.

Catalyst Pharma has met the challenges, however, and has several approved products on the market for several conditions.', 'Catalyst has built up a portfolio of three approved drugs, through the acquisition of commercialization licenses. These are the corticosteroid Agamree, developed to treat patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); Firdapse, which is the only medication currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of Lamber-Easton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in patients ages 6 and up; and Fycompa, used in the treatment of epilepsy, which has shown efficacy against multiple types of seizures and is used in patients from age 4 and up.', 'The first of these drugs, Agamree, is the branded form of vamorolone, which received FDA approval in the treatment of DMD in October 2023.

This was a quarterly record for the company; revenues were up 82% year-over-year, and beat the forecast by $4.65 million. At the bottom line, Catalyst saw non-GAAP EPS of 53 cents per share, or some 7 cents per share better than had been anticipated.', 'For BofA’s analyst Jason Gerberry, the key here is Catalyst’s commercial portfolio, and proven record of acquiring solid portfolio products. He writes, in his initiation of coverage note, “We think Catalyst Pharma\xa0is a unique aggregator of innovative therapies in the premium-multiple rare disease space. CPRX has a track-record of highly capital efficient license/ acquisition deals that have generated favorable ROI. We see the upcoming launch of muscular dystrophy drug Agamree as the next phase of strategy validation. We believe Agamree will be successful given its competitive profile. Further, CPRX’s largest revenue-generating product, Firdapse, has room to grow. Ultimately, we think the shares are undervalued. On a P/E basis, the stock trades at a discount relative to comparable small- to mid-cap biopharma cos. Current valuation also implies a conservative outcome of Firdapse patent litigation.”', 'These comments back up the analyst’s Buy rating on the stock, and his $23 price target suggests a one-year upside of 43%. (To watch Gerberry’s track record, click here)', 'The Strong Buy consensus rating on Catalyst stock is unanimous, based on a total of 6 Buys, showing that Gerberry’s colleagues agree with the bullish outlook here. The shares are selling for $16.10 and the $25.09 average target price implies an upside of 56% in the next 12 months. (See CPRX stock forecast)', 'SBA Communications (SBAC)', 'Next up is SBA Communications, a real estate investment trust (REIT) with a unique twist. These companies typically acquire, own, manage, and lease out various forms of real properties; SBA Communications focuses this activity on cellular infrastructure, the physical locations and structures that support our wireless telecom networks. The company owns a variety of small cells, traditional cell sites, and distributed antenna systems at locations in North and South America, as well as in the Philippines, South Africa, and Tanzania.', 'SBA was founded in 1989, and is based in Boca Raton, Florida. The company works through both site leasing and site development. On the first, it owns multi-tenant cell towers and leases antenna space to cellular operators and wireless service providers, typically on a long-term lease structure. On the second track, SBA works with wireless companies in the processes of site acquisition, zoning approval, construction, and final hardware installation. SBA will also enter agreements with property owners for the development of cellular and wireless infrastructure.', 'The persistently high inflation – and consequently high interest rates – of the last few years put\xa0 pressure on the real estate market, and SBA could not avoid that headwind. The company’s most recent quarterly report, from 4Q23, showed a miss at the top line – but bottom line strength. Quarterly revenues fell by 1.6%, to just over $675 million, and missed the forecast by $7.24 million, or a shade over 1%. At the bottom line, SBA reported an adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) of $3.37 per share, or some 15 cents per share better than expected.', 'The AFFO is important, as it provides support for the company’s dividend. SBA recently raised its common share dividend payment to 98 cents per share, up more than 15% from the previous 85-cent payment. The annualized rate of $3.92 gives a yield of 1.75%. The new dividend is set for payment on March 28.', 'Covering SBAC shares for BofA, analyst Dave Barden is upbeat, noting, among other factors, the underlying strength of cellular demand and the prospect of lower interest rates later this year. He says of the stock, “We upgrade SBAC to Buy from Neutral. We believe the following: 1. There is inevitable upside to domestic carrier macro tower activity to meet growing customer demand despite decade low valuations; 2. There is a rising chance of accelerating buybacks with leverage well below the company’s target range, sitting at its lowest level in decades; 3. The downside impact of upcoming 2025/26 Sprint churn is well understood by the market; 4. Interest expense headwind concerns will diminish as the potential for rate cuts in 2024+ grows.”', 'Along with his upgraded Buy rating, Barden sets a price target of $260, implying that the stock will appreciate by 16% over the coming year. (To watch Barden’s track record, click here)', 'There are 8 recent analyst reviews on record for SBA Communications, and they include 7 Buys to just 1 Hold – for a Strong Buy consensus\xa0 rating. These shares have a current trading price of $223.75, and their average target price of $260.29 nearly matches the BofA view. (See SBAC stock forecast)', 'BBB Foods (TBBB)', 'Last on our list is a company new to the public markets – but not to the food business. BBB Foods is the parent company of Tiendas 3B, a well-known Mexican discount grocery chain. The ‘3B’ name refers to the Spanish words bueno, bonito, and barato, or ‘good, nice, and affordable,’ in English, and covers the company’s mission to its customers – providing quality products at bargain prices to budget-conscious shoppers.', 'While Tiendas 3B is the company’s largest subsidiary, with operations across Mexico, the BBB Foods parent company also has operations in Central America, the Dominican Republic, and the US. The company has several in-house brands of food products, including Hugo Pork and Hugo Chick.', 'The TBBB ticker was taken onto the New York stock exchange just last month, in an IPO that saw TBBB open for trading on February 9. The initial offering price was expected at $17.50, but the shares opened at $19.50. The IPO gave the company a valuation of $2.2 billion, and after additional share appreciation in the stock’s first month of trading, the company now has a market cap of $2.35 billion.', 'The strong IPO caught the attention of analyst Robert Ford, who opened coverage of the shares for Bank of America. Ford sees the company’s breadth of product offerings, including private labels, as a net plus, along with its solid marketing: “Tiendas 3B offers about 800 SKUs at prices comparable to or below big box rivals in a convenience, warehouse-like format. Its private labels are aggressively priced vs peers (10-15% cheaper) and in our view often higher quality, and today make up nearly half of sales. TBBB’s mix covers about half of its target market spending and includes a treasure hunt component that further differentiates its value proposition.”', '“Tiendas 3B generates high store-level pre-tax returns (~60%), which should further improve as scale, private label and consumer awareness continue to evolve,” Ford adds, and goes on to outline the firm’s prospects: “Hard discount represents <3% of Mexican food retail, suggesting the potential to grow rapidly. An effective incumbent competitive response, in our view, would likely entail costly cannibalization.”', 'In the analyst’s view, this adds up to a Buy rating, and his price target, opened at $26, suggests that a one-year upside of 22% is waiting in the wings. (To watch Ford’s track record, click here)', 'With 4 analyst reviews on record, including 3 to Buy against a single Hold, this new stock has earned a Strong Buy rating from the analysts’ consensus. The shares are trading for $21.26 and have an average price target of $26, matching BofA’s objective.

Specifically, the downside capture ratio for high dividend stocks has been 81% or less across different extended periods. In simpler terms, during months when the S&P 500 Index experienced declines, high dividend stocks decreased by approximately 19% less than the broader market.

This outperformance trend extends to periods of rising interest rates, with high dividend stocks outpacing the S&P 500 in 7 out of 10 instances since 1960.

In comparison, in low-income countries, only 27% of the population uses the Internet as of 2023, which in itself was an increase from 24% in 2022.

Indeed, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Tesla, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are all disrupting AI in their own unique ways.', 'But among megacap tech companies, perhaps the most important player is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The semiconductor manufacturer is at the forefront of generative AI -- its graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center operations are playing a critical role in accelerated computing, machine learning, and more.', ""After generating record revenue in 2023, Nvidia is sitting on a $26 billion cash pile. Let's see how the company is investing its profits to help position itself for long-term growth."", 'A couple of weeks ago, investors learned that Nvidia has a small ownership position in a company called SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN), a developer of voice-recognition software. The company works with automobile manufacturers and restaurants, and its software can be integrated into smart devices.', 'Big tech has shown a keen interest in voice-powered assistants for many years. Apple acquired both Siri and Shazam, while Microsoft acquired Nuance in 2021 for nearly $20 billion. Moreover, both Amazon and Alphabet leverage the technology for their respective lines of smart home appliances.', ""Considering that other major tech players have invested in technologies similar to SoundHound AI's, and the projected market size is $50 billion, it's easy to see why Nvidia is making its move now -- as use cases for AI continue to evolve."", ""Nvidia swiftly followed the news about SoundHound AI with an investment in a start-up called Figure AI. Figure AI is developing humanoid robots, similar to Tesla's Optimus robot."", ""Although humanoid robots aren't commercially applied today, many companies are investing heavily in the technology. One reason could be that the addressable market is expected to reach $38 billion over the next decade, according to research conducted by Goldman Sachs."", ""There are likely a few key reasons why Nvidia is interested in Figure AI. The combination of Nvidia's chips and its under-the-radar software business could play a unique role in developing Figure AI's robotics ambitions."", 'Moreover, the investment by Nvidia is an important step as the company seeks to grow beyond GPUs. While I see the chip business as its bread and butter, Nvidia will have to demonstrate that it has alternative products and services that can scale as competition in the AI landscape heats up.', 'Many investors see Nvidia as primarily a hardware business, but one of the most overlooked areas the company is exploring is enterprise software. In September, Nvidia participated in a $500 million funding round for artificial intelligence (AI) software company Databricks.', 'Following the investment, Nvidia\'s CEO Jensen Huang said that ""enterprise data is a gold mine for generative AI.""', ""Databricks adds a new layer for Nvidia's enterprise software services business, which is already operating at an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion. This is an important relationship for Nvidia to nurture as demand for AI-powered services continues to surge, and I don't think the partnership should be overlooked."", ""Nvidia's A100 and H100 chips have played a major role in its growth over the last year. However, despite the popularity of these semiconductor models, the company is already designing even better technology."", ""It's marketing its next-generation chips under the moniker Blackwell. Of particular interest, Nvidia's H200 chips reportedly double the inferencing performance of the H100. During the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, management told investors that the H200 chips are already witnessing strong demand, and Nvidia is planning to launch in the second quarter."", 'Following the release of the H200, Nvidia is planning to encore with its most powerful chip yet later this year.', 'The last area that Nvidia is investing in is the supply chain. Semiconductor businesses are generally cyclical, given their exposure to broader trends in technology spending and manufacturing. Over the last few years, supply chains and logistics efforts have become strained due to a mixture of COVID-induced disruption and geopolitical tensions. Nvidia has not been immune to these challenges.', ""In order to keep up with surging demand, Nvidia has had to make some concessions on the cost side of the house. The company has been ratcheting up its spending in order to fulfill backlog. While this includes sourcing components for chips, it's important to note that Nvidia does not make its own chips. Instead, they outsource this part of the supply chain to Taiwan Semiconductor.

"", ""Now, I don't mean it's time to eliminate the Dow. That would be going too far. I just mean it's time for investors to focus on other indexes, particularly when it comes to where they're going to invest their hard-earned money."", ""Because while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has a storied history dating back more than 130 years, it hasn't been keeping up with the other major indexes of late. Indeed, of the three main benchmark indexes -- the S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite, and the Dow -- the Dow has by far the lowest rate of return since the end of the financial crisis."", ""What's more, in the era of plentiful exchange-traded funds (ETFs), investors have more choices than ever before. "", 'One such ETF, the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund (NYSEMKT: VGT), is in my view a superior alternative to the Dow.', ""The Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund focuses (as you'd expect from the name) on the information technology sector. It tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index, a benchmark that comprises large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap U.S. tech stocks."", 'Top holdings include tech megacaps like Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia.', 'Company Name', 'Symbol', 'Percentage of Assets', 'Microsoft', 'MSFT', '20.5%', 'Apple', 'AAPL', '20.2%', 'Nvidia', 'NVDA', '5.1%', 'Broadcom', 'AVGO', '4%', 'Adobe', 'ADBE', '2.2%', 'Since most tech stocks pay either low-yielding dividends or no dividends at all, the ETF has a tiny yield of 0.6%. However, the fund also boasts a minimal expense ratio of 0.1% -- meaning investors will only pay $10 in annual fees for every $10,000 they have invested in the fund.', ""In short, it's a better choice for investors because of its holdings."", ""First, it gives outsized weights to Microsoft and Apple, each of which accounts for about 20% of the fund's holdings. Compare that to the Dow, where Microsoft accounts for only about 7% of the index, and Apple accounts for less than 3%."", 'Next, the Vanguard fund has numerous semiconductor companies, including Nvidia (5% of fund holdings), Broadcom (4%), and Advanced Micro Devices (2%). The Dow, meantime, has only one semiconductor stock among its 30 holdings: Intel, a longtime laggard within the sector.', 'Last, the Vanguard ETF is solely focused on the tech industry, one of the top-performing sectors of the previous three decades. The Dow, on the other hand, is loaded with lackluster stocks from underperforming sectors, including Verizon, 3M, and Boeing, to name just a few.', 'For all those reasons, the Vanguard fund has trounced the Dow. An investment of $10,000 in the Vanguard fund made 10 years ago would have grown to almost $64,000 today. The same $10,000 invested in the Dow would be worth less than $30,000.', ""Despite its recent underperformance, the Dow isn't a terrible index, it just has a specific mission."", 'The Dow Jones Industrial Average is meant to represent a broad array of U.S. companies spanning multiple sectors -- energy, industrials, finance, healthcare, consumer discretionary, etc. By contrast, the Vanguard Information Technology Index fund only invests in the tech sector, which has been perhaps the best one to invest in, given its rapid growth and high profitability.', ""So, we should all give the Dow a break -- it's just doing its job. And its diversified holdings may fit the needs of some investors better than a tech-focused index fund."", ""That said, for most investors, particularly growth-oriented investors, it's time to forget the Dow and load up on the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund instead."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF wasn’t one of them.

Replacing typical diesel generators, Accelera fuel cells now serve as the primary power unit in the conversion project of a light On Track Machine (OTM) Vehicle in Austria developed for the HY2RAIL project.', ""In partnership with the Austrian railway authority ÖBB, recognized for managing one of Europe's most advanced railway systems, the HY2RAIL project demonstrates how fuel cells can sustainably meet the power needs of heavy-duty freight locomotives."", 'To power the locomotive, m.ZERO, an Austrian engineering consultancy, integrated Accelera fuel cell power modules into a strong 120kW system. This customized system meets strict rail vehicle standards, including the European standard EN 61373, which outlines testing requirements for railway applications, focusing on shock and vibration.', 'Furthermore, m.ZERO oversaw the integration of all balance-of-plant components and interfaces in collaboration with Accelera. The fuel cell system was then combined with a ternary battery system to create a hybrid propulsion system that includes cutting-edge power electronics, on-board hydrogen storage technology, a vehicle control unit, and software. This integration was led by m.ZERO in partnership with project leaders Hy2RAIL.', 'ÖBB’s technical service arm, TrainTech, played a pivotal role in overseeing the railcar’s modernization. The transformed locomotive was previously an OBB X534-type catenary construction and maintenance railcar, reliant on a diesel-electric propulsion system.

Now to better understand the broader landscape and goals of such activist investor fights, we are joined by Bruce Goldfarb. He is the Okapi Partner CEO and President."", ""Thank you for joining us here today. So we talk a lot about shareholder activism here.

Great to see you again, Julie. Activism is when investors start to say I'm not happy with the price of the shares that I own."", 'There is something that can be done to make the share price go up. And very frequently, that means we have ideas about the plan. We believe there can be better board oversight of the company, board members who can solve problems.', ""And we are seeing that in droves this year. And companies like you mentioned, Disney, and we saw it with Starbucks. And we are seeing it just settled now with Advance Auto Parts. And then there's Norfolk Southern."", ""The reality is activism means an investor is saying I'm going to put my mouth where my money is. And I'm going to fix problems that haven't yet been addressed. And we're seeing that now. And shareholders are cheering it on, whether it's large institutions or retail investors."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Bruce, now, if I have it right Tryon is your client in this particular situation.', ""BRUCE GOLDFARB: That's right."", ""JULIE HYMAN: So I don't know how much you can say. But I'm going to ask you about it anyway. This has gotten pretty contentious."", 'I mean, in Disney, with all the power of its media might has been on a campaign. They put out a cartoon, they put out some new material. In the face of that, how do you advise your client to be successful? I mean, both sides have been getting a little bit personal and nasty one could say.', ""BRUCE GOLDFARB: Well, you're right. There's only so many things that I can discuss that we talk about in terms of strategy. But let's appreciate that the messaging that Tryon puts out is very accurate. If you own shares of Disney, you have lost value."", ""And that there are actions that need to be taken to restore that value, to restore the magic at Disney. And effectively, it goes from the Oversight level. And it's really great when companies can talk in generalities of what they're going to do. But it's about execution."", ""And that's what activism is ultimately about. It's about the execution of a plan or the ideas that haven't been thought through. And I really can't say something that Nelson and the Trian team haven't said so effectively already about this, Julie."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Would there be any actions that Disney could take that would get Trian to back?

And that's why there was a proxy fight last year that was pulled back. But it's about follow through."", 'And what can be taken this year? It seems that a lot of shareholders are saying support Trian and put some new people on the board.', ""JARED BLIKRE: I'd like to take a step back here. Just in general, think about the role of passive investing. And the role that has made on shareholder votes."", 'Because you have a company like BlackRock through iShares having incredible sway over the proxies, over the potential direction of these companies. Do activist investors consult with some of these big ETF producers? And how critical is it to get them on your side?', ""BRUCE GOLDFARB: That's the right question because it's all about figuring out who your shareholders are, how those shareholders think, and how they're going to vote. And so part of our job as an investor response firm is we bring our clients to these investors. And we allow them to express their message and understand the process in a way where they can take action and vote."", ""Now, ultimately, the largest institutional investors like BlackRock, and Vanguard, and State Street have very big sway. They own big positions. What's been very interesting in the last year or so is they've taken those positions."", ""And BlackRock has sort of had this concept of allowing investors to make their voting choice. And so we're seeing institutions who manage money with BlackRock making their own voting decisions. We're seeing individuals now go out and make their voting choice if they care about the process."", 'The big challenge always is with retail shareholders. How do you get them to overcome their apathy and vote? And so part of what we do is we reach out to the retail shareholders.', ""And you talked about messaging. You talked about cartoons, and video, and social media. We're making phone calls. We're sending letters. We're working through with social media to reach out to people to get them to vote."", 'JULIE HYMAN: On the behalf of companies?', ""BRUCE GOLDFARB: We do it on behalf of companies. Lately, we've done it on behalf of investors as well."", ""JULIE HYMAN: So because I'm curious about that because there was a story today in the Wall Street Journal about more Americans than ever owning stocks. But they're not voting to your point. And traditionally, I have the sort of concept in my mind of companies not necessarily wanting people to vote."", ""They make their shareholder meetings in obscure places. It's difficult to get to. It's not as accessible. Has that improved in your view?"", ""BRUCE GOLDFARB: Well, it's changed. So, for example, meetings aren't always in obscure places, they're right on your computer. Very few companies now actually have a live meeting."", ""And in some instances, that's maybe a change in the system that's imperfect. On the other hand, every shareholder can figure out a way to attend the meeting. The key is not attending the meeting, the key is to express your opinion and vote."", ""And you're also correct that individuals are largely apathetic toward voting. And when institutions own most of the shares, maybe it doesn't matter. But when you have certain companies that are widely held owned by individuals 20%, 30%, 40% of the shares, each of those votes matter."", ""And it becomes critical to get the message out. And we've seen changes in how we reach out to people. But we've also seen changes in how they have the ability to vote."", ""There's more online voting with a proxy fight have a universal proxy card. So you can pick exactly who you want to be as your nominee."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Bruce, good to see you. Thanks for coming in. Appreciate it.', 'BRUCE GOLDFARB: Thanks.']"

During an interview last week, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) CEO Bob Iger admitted that despite the success of Disney+ in surpassing\xa0100 million subscribers\xa0in a short period of time and now gathering 150 million, Disney is behind Netflix when it comes to technology. When it comes to streaming, Disney is at a disadvantage with higher marketing expenses, along with customer acquistion and retention costs\xa0due to not having the technological capabilities of Netflix.', 'Disney expects its streaming business that includes\xa0Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+\xa0will reach the profitable shore by the end of the September fiscal quarter. However, the bigger picture is that streaming needs to grow to become a significant growth driver for the entertainment giant. Besides Disney+, Hulu is also an important part of the company’s streaming vision. Disney is in the process of\xa0finalizing its buyout of\xa0the\xa033% stake in Hulu\xa0from NBCUniversal. Despite not being global like Disney+, Hulu\xa0became a good brand with good content. There’s also ESPN+ with which Disney got sports covered. Last month, Disney made an agreement with\xa0Fox Corporation (NASDAQ: FOXA)\xa0and Warner Bros\xa0Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) to put\xa0all their sports programming under a single broadband roof. According to Variety,\xa0Disney, Fox and WBD together control\xa0about\xa085% of the U.S. sports rights market. Together, Disney, Fox and Warner Bros will undoubtedly shake things up in the world of TV sports by concentrating their sports programs under one roof. The structure of the deal resembles to that NBCUniversal and\xa0predecessor company to Fox\xa0made when they launched Hulu.', 'While speaking at\xa0at the 2024 Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference, Iger stated that\xa0Disney needs the technological capability\xa0that Netlifx has in order to\xa0lower customer acquisition and retention cost, as well as churn rates by\xa0increasing\xa0engagement.\xa0Last but certainly not least, Disney needs to\xa0grow its streaming\xa0margins by reducing marketing expenses.', 'As Iger emphasized, Disney is a complex company to run with its business spanning across experience parks, cruise ships, movies, TV and streaming. It is also stepping in the gaming universe as it unveiled in February it will be investing $1.5 billion in “Fortnite” developer Epic Games.\xa0\xa0With this strategic partnership, Disney will be making its own gaming universe.', 'But before stepping into the future, Disney has a lot of fixing up to do, which is why Iger is\xa0back at the helm.

By that time, Disney had fully withdrawn its investment in ValueAct and the firm no longer managed any money for Disney when it built its equity stake last year, the spokesman said.', 'Disney didn’t respond to a request for comment.', 'Blackwells argues that its revelation should encourage the company to be more transparent about is relationship with ValueAct. “The Information-Sharing Agreement, the information shared under it, and details of the pre-existing, and current, Disney/ValueAct relationship on long standing is material information for shareholders.

This proved to be a temporary phenomenon, as the global tourism industry recovered to 88% of pre-pandemic levels in 2023. UNWTO has predicted that the industry will surpass pre-pandemic levels during 2024. Given this, the resurgence of global tourism in the post COVID era is quite incredible. And within the tourism market, the growth in popularity of theme parks is second to no other.', 'Unlike the safaris of Africa or the coast of a Mediterranean island which offer tranquility and seclusion, the proposition of theme parks poses a stark contrast. This is because theme parks offer vacationers an escape from reality by immersing themselves within a pop culture fantasy. The thrill of a 100-mph roller coaster is itself exciting, however, when supplemented with the thought of escaping from the jaws of Balerion, it provides an unparalleled euphoria.', 'Consequently, the global amusement and theme parks industry accumulated a turnover of USD 79.68 Billion in 2023, as per a recently published report by Research and Markets. The same report projects that this figure will cross USD 105 Billion by 2028. Currently, one of the largest players in the theme parks industry is The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). In its Q1 2024 earnings report, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) revealed a total revenue of $23.55 billion, translating to an impressive $1.04 per share. This marks a modest uptick from Q1 2023, where the company recorded earnings of 99 cents per share with a revenue of $23.51 billion.', 'Despite being an overwhelming leader in the market, boasting 12 parks across five countries, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is only one of many theme parks situated around the world. It is also worth mentioning that a trip to the Disney World comes at a cost which may be unattainable for many to expend. Whilst Disney does offer a once in a lifetime experience to travelers, holidaymakers on a budget or those looking to embark upon a fresh theme park experience may turn towards alternative theme parks for their family vacations.', ""Last October marked the 100th anniversary of the The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). But what makes it so successful? While storytellers: animators, actors, writers, songwriters, directors, and producers, must not be ignored, its success must also be attributed to its visionary founder, Walt Disney, all the same. Walt Disney is the man who laid the foundation for the company's evolution from a moderately successful animation studio to a global entertainment powerhouse."", ""The company’s strategic acquisitions, including Pixar, Marvel, and the 21st Century Fox media assets, positioned Disney as the largest media powerhouse globally, boasting a market cap of $238.9 billion. It’s constant push towards innovation in the world of animation and business itself, coupled with the creation of iconic characters like Mickey Mouse, allowed the company to thrive even during challenging times such as the Great Depression. Further, its expansion into diverse business units, such as theme parks, merchandising, and cruise ships, has further helped to solidify Disney's position as a complete entertainment experience."", 'Specifically, it’s theme park business is successful due to its unparalleled dedication to creating immersive experiences that cater to all ages, coupled with iconic characters and timeless storytelling, fostering a sense of magic and wonder.', 'Since this list comprises of theme parks around the world, you may be interested in reviewing travel deals to help streamline your vacation.

Using a consensus approach, we obtained a list of the most commonly recommended theme parks apart from those owned by the Walt Disney Company. This approach also allowed us to obtain an initial score for each park based on the number of times it was recommended across different sources."", 'Once this list was obtained, we used trip advisor ratings, the popularity of each park (gauged by the number of reviews), and our previous scores as 3 distinct metrics for our rankings. Since US based parks tend to have a higher number of reviews on trip advisor, we diminished the impact of this metric in comparison to the other metrics. Finally, we omitted destinations currently being impacted by hostile political conditions, thus making it unfavorable for tourists to visit them in the current climate.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

At first glance, Phantasialand’s dark, dystopian, and often creepy outlook may seem like a daunting and unwelcoming sight for a family vacation. However, as far as fantasy experiences go, there is perhaps no other park as creative as Phantasialand. Situated near Cologne in Germany, this park consists of 6 different zones, each of which represents a distinct civilization of the world from a point in history. In doing so, the park allows its visitors the chance to immerse themselves in an interactive journey across the sands of time. In addition, ticket prices in Phantasialand are modest in comparison to any of the Disney resorts, with ample accommodation for families in the vicinity of the park.', 'Insider Monkey Rating: 8.5', 'Trip Advisor Rating: 4.5 (12,216 Reviews)', 'Considered as one of America’s (if not the) best theme parks in the US barring Disney and Universal, Silver Dollar City is situated in the heart of the Ozark Mountains. While there are several other parks in our list which incorporate historical epochs, Silver Dollar City stands out since it imitates only one-time period. The theme of this park is set in the 1880s, and it has made great efforts to preserve this cultural identity. By incorporating wooden roller coasters and a range of other Ozark-centric elements into the rides, the park offers a unique blend of tradition and thrill. Moreover, apart from rides, Silver Dollar City hosts several thematic festivals around the year and also offers visitors chances to observe and take part in crafts such as glass blowing, pottery, and candle making.', 'Insider Monkey Rating: 8.5', 'Trip Advisor Rating: 4.5 (1,830 Reviews)', 'A lack of reviews on trip advisor is generally worrisome. There is one exception to this rule. Everland, perhaps the most iconic theme park in the eastern hemisphere, offers a mix of scintillation and serenity. Across 5 different themes, the park is home to some of the fastest rides such as the T-Express. It also contains several attractions for nature lovers, as it allows viewers to travel on a Safari ride and capture a glimpse of some of the most exotic creatures in their natural habitat. For foreigners, a trip to Everland is also a chance to experience the vibrant culture of South Korea, including their rich cuisine.

However, for people in the Lego community, this destination holds a special affection. Billund, Denmark is regarded as the birthplace of Legos, and quite appropriately it is home to the first ever Legoland in the world. Thus, this park offers a historical insight into the evolution of Legos and Legoland, which its counterparts cannot capture. Moreover, in comparison to other parks around the world, Legoland offers a very children centric experience, making it a very enjoyable experience for families with infants. There is a visible commitment towards creativity and innovation, which seeps through every single ride, performance, and sculpture you come across.

It offers an immersive experience to the muggles of our world, enabling them to maraud into the forbidden corridors of Hogwarts, entertain themselves with ingenious magical contraptions at Zonko’s, before enjoying a calming dose of butterbeer amongst the villagers of Hogsmeade.

Despite its location, this park does not offer its visitors the chance to plunge into the Italian culture. Rather, the park takes you on a voyage to mythical realms such as the Fantasy Kingdom, or the Kung Fu Panda academy. Through its commitment towards storytelling and engagement, the park helps visitors tread the shoes of their favorite pop culture characters, even offering a unique experience to trek within the jungles of Jumanji.

It was ranked 27 by Forbes on their Best Customer Service 2024\xa0list, being one of only 2 theme parks on the list.

Moreover, trends indicate that the numbers of Internet users increase at an annual rate of 4%, meaning that an estimated 196 million new people gain access to the Internet every year.', 'When we take a deeper look into the users’ demographics, we find that internet use has a close-knit connection to the country’s development. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)’s findings, in 2020, nine out of ten people used the Internet in high-income countries. In comparison, in low-income countries, only 27% of the population uses the Internet as of 2023, which in itself was an increase from 24% in 2022. In an era where the world is so tightly bound together by the Internet, this gap in Internet users reflects the digital disparity between high and low-income countries and regions.\xa0\xa0', 'The Internet provides access to a vast amount of information and knowledge on a daily basis to its users, which bridges the gap in education and learning between urban and rural populations. It also creates ample job opportunities and contributes to economic growth. Furthermore, the Internet fills the communication gap by connecting people globally, and, most importantly, it allows individuals from developing countries to stay informed on global news and participate in online conversations. This connectivity and involvement on a global scale spreads awareness amongst less privileged individuals, which, in the long term, reduces inequality.\xa0', 'The people who have no access to the Internet remain deprived of all these benefits, and their knowledge of day-to-day world events is also strictly limited and heavily influenced by the local media and literature. Although the development of a country does affect the provision of the Internet to its population, there are other reasons why people may be denied access to the Internet.\xa0', 'For example, in North Korea, citizens cannot use the Internet due to censorship. In fact, the use of the Internet is illegal for the general public, and only a few thousand elites have access to it. The rest of the 25 million citizens have very limited access to information, online education, and growth opportunities. While they do have access to a domestic intranet that allows access to very limited and highly surveilled websites, residents of North Korea can only guess how the actual internet looks.\xa0', 'Overall, even though billions of people do not have access to the Internet today, the use of this technology is vital for individuals to grow and for countries to prosper.

Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' See our latest analysis for Prudential Financial ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Prudential Financial is:', '8.4% = US$2.5b ÷ US$30b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.08."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Prudential Financial has a lower ROE than the average (13%) in the Insurance industry classification."", ""Unfortunately, that's sub-optimal. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved."", 'Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.', 'Prudential Financial clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.12. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.', 'Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality.

In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness.

The stock gained ground as the trading day wore on and by the time the market closed, the stock was up 7.2%.', 'The broader market was decidedly mixed today, looking for direction, but the catalyst that helped send the chipmaker higher was strong quarterly results by Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). The company cited strong demand for AI-centric cloud services with demand far outstripping supply.

Since the vast majority of AI computing is done in the cloud and data centers, this benefits Nvidia. Second, the company is also the go-to for processors used in machine learning -- an earlier branch of AI -- controlling a 95% share of that market as well.

So, Amazon has the advantage of time and deep customer relationships to develop its own compelling AI offerings."", ""Of course, Amazon has been doing this in spades already, not only by developing its own large language models (LLMs) under the Titan brand name, but also hosting the broadest number of third-party LLMs for AWS clients under the AWS Bedrock platform. Additionally, Amazon offers highly cost-effective AI for applications that can run on Amazon's in-house developed chips Trainium and Inferentia."", ""And Amazon's non-cloud businesses, from e-commerce to advertising to physical stores and satellite broadband, are all likely to benefit from generative AI. While AI may help smaller competitors catch up to leaders in certain industries, Amazon's giant physical e-commerce distribution infrastructure is unlikely to be disrupted by an AI software algorithm. That leaves Amazon's massive and data-rich e-commerce businesses likely to be greatly enhanced by GenAI from both a revenue generation and cost perspective."", ""Investors have recently seen AWS' revenue growth stabilize since the broader tech downturn began in 2022, and have also seen profitability inflect upwards in Amazon's e-commerce businesses.

Thus, Micron is likely to experience a massive profit surge as the industry comes out of this downturn, and perhaps catapulting to new heights on the back AI demand.', 'As one of only three producers of leading-edge DRAM memory worldwide, Micron and its peers all cut back heavily on production last year, and repurposed their equipment to make leading edge DDR5 and high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which are currently in extremely high demand to feed AI applications.', 'The control of supply along with recovering demand, led by the super-strong demand for AI memory, is leading to a massive recovery in DRAM pricing and volumes.

Analyst Brian Chin now has a price target of $120 on Micron, up significantly from the earlier target of $80. The upgraded price target points toward a 25% upside from current levels.', ""AI is a big reason behind Chin's analyst upgrade. Chin's research note pointed out that Micron has now joined the AI party, which is not surprising as Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) has already been selected by Nvidia for deployment in its next-generation AI chips. But that's not where the good news ends."", ""Let's look at the reasons why AI is set to drive solid growth for Micron in the coming year."", ""Micron has already won the HBM slot at Nvidia, and Stifel's Chin predicts that it is on track to supply this type of memory to Advanced Micro Devices as well. If that's indeed the case, then Micron will be well on its way to capitalizing on a solid growth opportunity."", 'Market research firm Yole Group estimates that HBM shipments could jump a massive 150% in 2024, generating just over $14 billion in revenue for memory chipmakers. For comparison, the HBM market was worth an estimated $5.5 billion in 2023. The good part is that this market is set for solid expansion in the long run, with shipments predicted to increase at an annual pace of 25% through 2029.', 'Stifel points out that the growing demand for HBM will have a positive impact on the dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) market as a whole, creating tight supplies and lifting average selling prices (ASPs). It is worth noting that there is a supply shortage of HBM chips already, which is why memory industry participants are focusing their energies on increasing the output of these chips.', 'As a result, there may be a shortage in other niches of the memory market as well. For instance, the demand for consumer electronics such as personal computers (PCs) and smartphones is anticipated to jump in 2024 following sharp declines in the past couple of years. IDC forecasts a 2.8% increase in smartphone shipments this year following a 3.2% drop last year.', ""PC shipments are expected to jump 3.4% this year, compared to a 14% drop in 2023. AI, however, is likely to give the likes of Micron an incremental growth opportunity in both PCs and smartphones. That's because AI-powered smartphones and PCs are likely to command bigger memory chips, thereby expanding Micron's addressable market."", 'All this indicates why Stifel is forecasting a tight supply of DRAM this year, which should ideally lead to stronger pricing. The good part is that the memory market is already seeing stronger pricing. DRAM prices were up between 13% and 18% in the fourth quarter of 2023, reversing two years of declines. They are expected to jump identically in the current quarter as well.', ""More importantly, memory pricing is likely to get better as the year progresses. This explains why the DRAM market's revenue is expected to increase a terrific 88% in 2024 to just over $87 billion, according to Gartner. The improving end-market conditions tell us just why Micron's top and bottom lines are set to improve substantially this year, which could lead to a huge jump in the company's stock price."", ""Micron released its fiscal 2024 first-quarter results (for the three months ended Nov. 30, 2023) in December last year. The company's revenue was up nearly 16% year over year to $4.7 billion. However, as the DRAM prices were yet to gain momentum at that time, its non-GAAP (adjusted) loss increased to $0.95 per share from $0.04 per share in the year-ago period."", ""Its operating income margin stood at a negative 20% in the quarter. However, that was an improvement over the negative operating margin of 30% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, indicating that the memory market's improving dynamics are already having a positive impact on Micron."", ""Analysts predict Micron's loss will shrink to $0.34 per share in fiscal 2024 from $4.45 per share in the previous year. More importantly, its earnings in the next fiscal year, which will begin in September 2024, are predicted to jump big-time."", ""Assuming Micron's bottom line indeed jumps to $6.78 per share in the next fiscal year and it trades at 30 times earnings at that time (using the Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple as a benchmark as Micron is a component of this index), its stock price could jump to $203 next year. That points toward a potential upside of just over 111% from current levels, indicating that investors can consider buying this semiconductor stock right now as it is trading at a really attractive 10 times earnings."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

He replaced Griffin with Peter Robb, whose record as an anti-labor lawyer was well nigh unassailable and whose hostility to the joint-employer rule was manifest.

Digital Realty (NYSE: DLR) trades about 15% below its three-year peak. But when concerns about interest rate increases were more top of mind in late 2022 and 2023, these two dividend stocks were trading down more than 40% from their highs.', 'Value-focused investors will probably see this situation and think they missed out. However, another stock market sell-off would likely bring renewed opportunity.', 'Mr. Market is fickle and often swings between enthusiasm and pessimism (sometimes for no apparent reason). While it can be hard to step in and buy stocks when Wall Street is in the dumps, it is often the period when the best deals can be found. For instance, it was a great time to buy real estate investment trusts (REITs) when interest rates were heading sharply higher. Now, as the mood around interest rates has become more sanguine, REITs are recovering.', ""That's the big story behind the 40%-plus stock price declines at Prologis and Digital Realty that have now been materially pared. They are both very good companies with solid long-term outlooks. However, Mr. Market's mood could quickly turn negative again, especially if there's a broader sell-off. If that were to take place, Prologis and Digital Realty could once again be attractively priced. It's worth keeping this pair on your wish list. Here's why."", ""Prologis is one of the largest warehouse owners in the world, with a portfolio spread across four continents. The dividend yield today is around 2.8%, but it was up around 3.5% or so not too long ago. A return to that level would make this stock very appealing. Furthermore, the dividend has been raised every year for a decade. And the annualized rate of increase over the past 10 years was roughly 11%. Warehouses are pretty boring assets, but they are vital to world trade, with Prologis' portfolio strategically located in some of the most important global transportation hubs."", 'There are three things to like here over the long term. First, Prologis is a giant REIT, sporting a market cap of roughly $120 billion. That gives it the scale to be an industry consolidator. Second, warehouse rental rates have increased significantly in recent years, allowing Prologis to roll over expiring leases at much higher rates. That process has yet to run its course, so more rent growth is on tap in the near term. Third, Prologis has a lot of vacant land in its portfolio on which it can build new warehouses. Management estimates this is a $40 billion long-term opportunity.', ""If there's a broad market sell-off that takes Prologis down with it, you'll probably want to jump at the chance to buy it."", ""Digital Realty's yield is roughly 3.2%. When the stock was at its nadir in 2023, the yield was well over 5%. If a broad market decline brought the yield back toward that peak, it would represent a very attractive buying opportunity. The dividend has been increased annually for an impressive 18 years."", ""The core story here is the increasingly interconnected world, which relies on the types of data centers that Digital Realty owns. The REIT's portfolio is global, with over 300 assets spread across North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Although demand can wax and wane, the business seems to be on a fairly strong footing today. In the fourth quarter of 2023, management noted that its backlog was at a record and that renewal leases were being signed at the highest levels since 2015. But the real attraction here is the fact that the world is getting more digital over time, and artificial intelligence is only likely to help push demand even higher."", ""All told, Digital Realty is a reliable dividend stock with a long growth runway ahead of it. A return to recent lows would be an opportunity that you probably wouldn't want to pass up."", ""There's no way to know when Mr. Market's mood will turn for the worse. And when it does, investors will likely be selling indiscriminately. It can be hard not to follow the crowd during times like that, but if you prepare ahead of time by creating a short list of stocks you'd like to own if only they were cheaper, you'll have a better chance of acting on the opportunities in front of you. Reliable dividend growers Prologis and Digital Realty are two names that should probably be on your wish list given the strong fundamental growth opportunities ahead of them."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Prologis right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Prologis, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Prologis wasn’t one of them.

It blocked JetBlue‘s (NASDAQ:JBLU) acquisition of Spirit Airlines (NASDAQ:SAVE), Illumina‘s (NASDAQ:ILMN) bid to sell Grail, blocked numerous hospital mergers, and issued tough new guidelines for such deals.', 'The FTC opposes Kroger taking over Albertson’s because it believes it will weaken unions. The agency’s record when challenged in court is spotty because it often overreaches. Industry trade groups say the Kroger case could be another example but could tamp down other M&A activity if successful.', 'Kroger is a strong, profitable grocer that will survive the government’s challenge regardless of how the case works out.

As you know, I was appointed the world President and CEO of Max site effective as of January 1 of this year. It is an honor to lead max site through its next phase of growth. After working closely with the executive team and Board over the last seven years, I would like to thank our founder, Doug, the offer for his contributions to Maxar over the past 25 years. In my first couple of months, as Mike's CEO, we have continued to execute our core mission and strategy, expand our strategic platform licenses or SPL portfolio and support the next generation of cell-based therapies with our expert expression platform. Our top priority remains supporting our customer success throughout the lifecycle research, clinical development and commercial launch. I believe we have substantial opportunities ahead of us in the cell therapy industry and I am committed to leading our organization with a high-level focus along with disciplined expense management and capital deployment. 2022 was a challenging but exciting year from a site. We faced a difficult operating environment along with many others in the industry as our customer base saw conservatism and capital spending lower than expected activity levels and prioritization of programs. Despite these challenges, 2023 was a transformative year for Max Life. Our technology support the approval cash, Javier, the first non-viral cell therapy product approved by the FDA developed by us build clients, crisper therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Backside extra platform is not the only electrification platform test supported a nonviral therapy through FDA approval and is now the only electrification platform supporting commercial therapy. We believe this is just the first of many potential pools by Max ISDL. clients over the coming years. And we are working hard to remain the platform of choice when it comes to electroporation. Max, our reported $41.3 million of total revenue for the full year of 2023 at the high end of the revenue range we preannounced in January 2024. Core business revenue was $29.8 million, also at the high end of our preannounced range. We were pleased to see our business begin to stabilize in the fourth quarter and with the strong execution of our team in a challenging environment. In 2023, we grew our instrument installed base to 683 as compared to an installed base of 616 at the end of 2022. While the instrument installed base expand this year, both instrument sales NPA sales decline in 2023 compared to 2022 across cell therapy and drug discovery customers. As I mentioned, we are operating in a challenging environment were early-stage customers and cell therapy and drug discovery have limited access to capital and some clinical customers have adjusted their spending and extended project timelines. This environment remain largely unchanged in the fourth quarter, though we are optimistic that the financing market for the cell therapy industry will improve over time. Non-viral cell therapy market trends continue to bode well for maXTouch platform. Customers at various stages of development are pursuing different approaches and indications. Developers continue to move towards non-viral cell engineering approaches that encompass multiple steps and complexity of edits, innovation and complexity and cell therapy development drives demand for Max sites, electroporation technology. While we are cautiously optimistic about near term market factors impacting our customers and non-viral cell therapy opportunity and regulatory backdrop for cell therapies continues to improve. Outside core business, we generated $11.5 million of SPL program related revenue for the full year of 2023 and $8.5 million during the fourth quarter. Both our full year 2023 and fourth quarter 2023 S field program related revenue came in at the high end of our preannounced range, driven primarily by Billy approval milestones from our clients in the fourth quarter of 2023. As a reminder, SBL program related revenue includes development and approval milestone payments as well as sales-based payments and or royalties from commercial clients. Across our [26] SPL to date, there are many nuances to the SPL contracts and the revenues associated with commercial products can vary. Generally receive 1% of product sales through either a royalty or sales-based payments in addition to receiving revenue from lease instruments, NPA sales to FPL customers, which is included in core revenue. As stated by Vertex of their fourth quarter 2023 earnings call the commercial launch of cash JV has commenced. As patients are screened and identified free treatment. They will enter the program at authorized training centers in which they will undergo pretreatment cell collection and manufacturing. And finally, Truman infusion max. I will only recognize revenue once a patient has been infused, which can take a number of months from the time a patient enrolls a therapy. Our visibility into timing of patient dosing is quite limited, and we will rely on Vertex provide us and the markets with updates on patient enrollment status as they come. At this time, we do not have enough information on timing of patient dosing to forecast expected commercial royalty revenue from the sales cash JV for 2024. As we move throughout the course of the year, we hope to have better insight into the patient journey and dosing timelines remain very optimistic about the long-term prospect for cash, and we look forward to the many patients receiving the treatment in the years to come. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to lay the groundwork for long-term growth at max site, just as we did several years ago with crisper to support ways now cash heavy. In 2023, we signed five new SPL clients, bringing the total number of FPL's to 23 as of December 31, 2023. These 23 SPL.'s represent over 160 programs of which 16 are programs in clinical development, along with one commercial program. That total pre-commercial revenue potential for Asco programs is now greater than $1.95 billion, up from $1.55 billion at the end of 2022, an increase of over $400 million in potential milestone payments. As you've probably already seen thus far in 2024, we have signed three additional appeals, bringing our total assigned SPL.s to 26 as of today. We believe the breadth of our expanding Esco portfolio continues to demonstrate the unique and valuable technology at max site use across cell types and editing tools. By way of example, Lyon TCR, whenever SPL customers, which we announced this year is a Singapore-based clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on development of T cell receptor therapies. For solid tumors, a life-threatening viral infections. Rspo alliance CCR has allowed us to expand our global presence into Asia to support the development of new therapies for patients with solid tumors we also signed as build energy, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company that's developing a range of new treatments that seek to activate the immune system of cancer patients to identify and eradicate tumors. Our platform technology was officially transferred from Precision BioSciences when global rights for Asiacell were obtained by imaging in August of last year, and we look forward to supporting imaging as they move towards a potential Phase 2 registrational trial for Asia selling cancer, an allogeneic CAR-T candidate, our most recent sign SPL client is with Legion, a clinical-stage biotechnology company, developing allogeneic off-the-shelf cell therapies to treat a broad range of hematological and solid tumor malignancies. Importantly, there room CAR T zero seven lead asset is currently in a global Phase 1(2) clinical trial for the treatment of relapsed or refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma and adolescent and adult patients. It has received orphan drug, Fast Track and rare pediatric disease designations from the FDA for the treatment of such conditions. We are encouraged by these recent appeals and are excited to witness the clinical progress that we believe our clients may make in the upcoming months and years with the support of our platform. The SPA agreements that were signed earlier this year have been many months or even years in the making our team worked very hard with customers to understand and optimize their research and development processes and objectives. This relationship office starts in research where customers utilize our expert ATX and then seamlessly scale to the GTx prior to entering the clinic as companies make progress towards entering clinical development. There's dynamic discussion around the SPL. relationship that takes quarters to negotiate and arrive at the final agreement following the success of our ability to enter into new SPL.s over the past couple of years, we are continuing to build and expand STL Pipeline as time progresses. We believe that having the only commercial nonviral therapy, which utilize our platform to engineer the cells, will generate additional interest and finalizing a number of new SPO agreements, which have been in discussion for some time and that new discussions can begin to support continued SPL signings in the years to come. We believe that there's opportunity for substantial clinical milestone and commercial revenue as RSDL clients' programs move towards late stage clinical development and commercialization. As we look into 2024, we have a robust STL Pipeline, which we will continue to execute on over the past two years. Max, I have strategically invested to support the growth opportunity ahead of us. Notably, we have made investments to ensure that we have the strongest manufacturing, regulatory and quality capabilities to support our customers throughout development and commercialization. We have added to our teams across the organization in order to scale the business and we have made targeted product development enhancements, including development of the BLX. We have developed disruptive technology in the BLX that will enable rapid production of transiently expressed proteins at large scale for preclinical and early clinical use that we believe will offer a much more efficient manner for research. We believe the commercial opportunity in the bioprocessing market is large, but will take some time to develop following feedback from industry and in more detailed evaluation of the opportunity for the Vilex, we are taking a more measured approach to developing applications and understanding customer needs before launching robust commercial offering for the Vilex, we remain committed to taking the time necessary to deliver the most efficient platform for our customers. Starting with evaluation of our beta customer feedback throughout 2024 and 2024 will be measured in our investments and focus on areas that we believe will deliver significant returns to our customers and maximizing the long term. The key areas of moderate investment may include improvements are best in class electrification systems, building additional application know-how, building capabilities to work with customers earlier in the continuum of development and selling into new applications for electroporation. In summary, we have entered 2024 well-positioned to deliver on our financial and strategic goals this year. Max, I will continue to navigate the operating environment methodically, recognizing the challenges we experienced in 2023 were felt industry-wide and staying vigilant of changing dynamics in our industry. I firmly believe in the long-term opportunity from that site as a premier enabler of non-viral cell therapies. With that, I will now turn the call over to Doug to discuss our financial results. Doug?"", 'Douglas Swirsky', ""Thank you, Maher, total revenue for the full year was $41.3 million compared to $44.3 million in 2022, representing a 7% decline. Total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $15.7 million compared to $12.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 26%. In the fourth quarter, we reported core revenue of $7.2 million compared to $10.6 million in the comparable prior year quarter, representing a 32% decline. This includes revenue from Cell Therapy customers of $5.5 million and revenue from drug discovery customers of $1.6 million, which declined 27% and 46% year-over-year, respectively. Within core revenue, instrument revenue was $2.3 million compared to $3.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 lease revenue was $2.4 million compared to $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. And processing assembly or PA revenue was $2.2 million compared to $3.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. We saw sequential improvement in instrument revenue and stabilization in PA revenue compared to the third quarter of 2023. Year over year declines in revenue were due to the challenging market for our customers, which resulted in conservatism of spend and pipeline prioritization. For the full year of 2023, we reported core revenue of $29.8 million compared to $39.6 million in 2022, representing a 25% decline. This includes revenue from Cell Therapy customers declining 25% year over year, and drug discovery revenue declining 23% year over year. Within our core revenue instrument revenue was $8.3 million compared to $11.7 million in 2022. Lease revenue totaled $10.3 million compared to $10.9 million in 2022, and PA revenue totaled $10.3 million compared to $16 million in 2022. Of note, 48% of our core business revenue was derived from SPL clients in 2023, which compares to 42% and 40% in 2022 and 2021, respectively, increase in revenue from SPL.s as a percentage of total core revenue highlights the challenges that early-stage pre-clinical customer space during the course of 2023, which we have spoken to you throughout the year. While our SPL. clients were not immune to funding constraints and pipeline prioritization, the magnitude of the decrease in core revenue from SPL clients was less substantial compared to our earlier stage customers. We recognized $8.5 million of SPL. program related revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $1.9 million of Espial carbon related revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, we recognized $11.5 million in milestone revenues as compared to $4.6 million in 2022. We exceeded our initial milestone guidance for 2023, which was a risk-adjusted forecast for the year. The approval milestones from our STL Pipeline in multiple geographies drove the upside to our initial guidance. Moving down the P&L. Gross margin was 90% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 88% in the fourth quarter of the prior year, driven by our mix between core and SPL. program related revenue. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $22.2 million compared to $17.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The overall increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by compensation expenses related to account professional base and lab and new product development expenses. Moving forward, the Company plans to continue to make strategic targeted investments while moderating our rate of OpEx growth in 2024. We will be disciplined in our spending, valuating investments in business and corporate development, commercial sales and marketing operations and field application scientists to drive long-term growth. We finished the fourth quarter with combined total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $211 million and no debt. Moving to our full year 2024 guidance. We provided initial guidance last week, and we are reiterating our outlook today. We expect core revenue of flat to 5% growth as compared to 2023. The components of our core business are anchored in lease revenue of clinical and commercial instruments, new instrument placements and the sale of processing assemblies, the consumables used by our customers. We are confident in our ability to grow the core business in 2024, we are not forecasting any substantial positive or negative change in the macro-economic environment for our customers. So I will note that the capital raising activity by the industry and some of our customers has started off better than we expected. Time will tell whether that capital finds its way to R&D programs that will drive demand for Maxim products, but we are keeping an open ear to customers and the potential for updated plans as market conditions evolve, we adapted to the difficult environment we saw in 2023 and are confident in our ability to execute through a stabilizing environment in 2024 SPL. program related revenue expected to be approximately $3 million in 2024. This is a risk-adjusted forecast that is achievable under a variety of potential outcomes across our SPL.s and their planned clinical progress. At the end of 2023, we recognized milestone revenue from one of our clients, which we had initially anticipated in 2024. Our expectations for SPL. program related revenue for 2024 will reflect the timing of this milestone and the resulting difficult year-over-year comparison. While we do not have visibility on the timing of cash getting patient infusions, we expect to begin to recognize royalty revenue from Vertex later in the year. However, we have not included royalty revenue from past Jebi in our initial 2024 outlook. Finally, Max sight remains in a strong financial position and continues to expect to end 2024 with approximately $175 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments and no debt on our balance sheet. I would like to close by stating that we are confident in our 2024 revenue outlook and believe that our modest cash burn and strong balance sheet will serve to support backside long-term growth. Now I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Maher."", 'Maher Masoud', ""Thank you Doug. Overall, we believe our accomplishments in 2023 and further validate endpoints of our expert electrification platform and the long term growth potential from Exide. We look forward to supporting our customers through the development stages and commercial activities to deliver new cell-based therapies to patients in need. Nexstar remains excited about the potential of our clients' assets as they progress through clinical development. And we are committed to expanding our SBL portfolio in 2024 and beyond. I'd like to thank the Maxar team for their dedicated work, which has helped solidify max size position as a premier enabler of non-viral cell therapies. With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator for the Q&A. Operator?"", 'Operator', 'Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Jacob Johnson, Stephens.', 'Jacob Johnson', ""Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe, Doug, just first on the guidance, I guess two questions. One, it doesn't sound like you're assuming any improvement in the end market can you just talk about if you've seen any signs from kind of the recent funding of moving more positivity from your customer base? And two, I understand, we're not including cash heavy royalty in the program revenues. Is any of that contemplated in the NEPA. or any PA sales contemplated in the core revenue guidance?"", 'Douglas Swirsky', ""Great. Thank you, Jacob. So I'll take those questions one at a time first, with respect to the guidance that we're providing and how we might be feeling about the macro environment, we've tried to be realistic in set conservative, achievable goals for ourselves this year. We do believe that that will probably hit the trough in terms of the overall market in cell therapy and or other end markets. So we're cautiously optimistic that things could improve this year, but this guidance does not really reflect an improving environment. So I think that there's certainly some upside there if the market improves, we've seen some early signs and we'll be encouraging some large financings done, and we'll see how that visit additional capital that's available that's flowing into the space might benefit us. But again, we're just being conservative in the way we've built. Our revenue has always been based on buildup from specific identified opportunities for on the instrument placement side, it's using a PA run rate. That's where we were at the end of last year as opposed to expecting and building into the forecast that things would improve. So again, I think a conservative and realistic forecast. And if the market improves and we do see some reason to be optimistic, then we could potentially benefit from that. But it's not built into the forecast. With respect to cash JV, what we've done there because of we're not including in our guidance for as pill burden related revenue. We're not including anything there. It's just challenging to really look at that. And also we don't want to get ahead of our partner in terms of predicting what sales would be some of the growth in core revenue, again, we're projecting or guiding to zero to flat. So we assume there will be some growth and that growth is going to be sort of with and without additional pieces of debt from cash out."", 'Jacob Johnson', ""Got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe, Maher, you mentioned how important the support of the commercial therapy is that maybe it'll it will help you close some additional NPLs. I'm just curious, it's been a couple of months since the approval of cash. You have a just curious kind of what your business development team targeting those last couple of months and if you're getting more inbounds now that you support the commercial therapy?"", 'Maher Masoud', ""Yes. Thank you Jacob. Nice senior most any question from you as always, I guess I just want to take a step back. Obviously, cash has been validating, as I've said before in terms of what it means for the company and also a means for the nonviral acetyl space. But in terms of obviously, we signed three SPL.s this year to date already. It definitely allows us to have that further conversation with the STL partners that are already in the negotiation phase and are those customers that are looking to transition to the clinic. But I don't want to take a step back here for a second cents. So if you look at how we've built our business development team over the last few years and really over the last six, seven years, even we're having more and more traction. Now the relationship we have with our customers really starts off in the early research, right? Where we're with them, oftentimes for 9 months, 12 months, 1.5 year. We are working into early research, helping them to talk to optimize our process and when they're ready to get into the clinic, that's when we enter into those negotiations. So cash, it gives us the ability to have those continued discussions and give us the ability to really help us with our increasing pipeline for SPL.s. But these relationships that we have is not just relying on our approval of a commercial product that's really relying on the team we've built here over the last few years and that scientific relationship that we've built with customers from research all the way through past the into the clinic for call to answer your question, Jacob."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Dan Arias, Stifel.', 'Dan Arias', ""Afternoon, guys. Thanks for the questions. Maher, just wanted to ask a follow-up question on cash JV and in doing so I think I'm probably just asking a broader question about the way that these commercialization events that your SPL.'s benefit you now that we're in the early days of seeing that play out. I mean, obviously, you have the royalty revenues on the sales of the drug. And I know you've said you don't have enough information there to make a call, which is fair. But to Jim's point, I mean, I'm just curious about the general ramp up in instrument utilization and activity that takes place at Vertex are crisper or wherever once they move into patient treatment mode. I mean it seems like that should go up as you as they make more product post-approval but is that true or is there a way of thinking about that? It would just be kind of helpful to understand the way that the model could be impacted when we think about these approval successes?"", 'Maher Masoud', ""Yes. Yes. So Dan, thanks for that question of great points. So obviously, that we will we don't want to speak ahead of Vertex. But as the patient enrollment increases as more patients more patients are screened and then eventually, if you'd absolutely wait. So we'll see that trajectory that that's what we hope is that the hockey stick for adoption of our cash valuation increases, the revenue that we have on the back end as well. So obviously, our net sales are a few that are our percentage of the candidate is based on the net sales of cash. I mean that would be for any commercial product that's approved that utilize our system. So yes, you can expect that ramp we can't speak to the numbers as to whether that is because we will that will that Vertex speak to what they anticipate being the forecast cast of the sales, but that's correct. I mean, as we have more and more patient adoption will have more utilization of consumables, more utilization of our of our instruments, which adds to that recurring instrument license fees that we have on an annual basis. So I ve been helped out a couple of them."", 'Dan Arias', ""Yes, that is. Okay. And then just as a follow-up, where do you think we are when it comes to draw down on the PA inventory levels? That's obviously been a factor. It seems like there could maybe be a little bit more visibility there than just a capital raise activity or pipeline progression. So just curious if you think that there is more visibility there and as that's an element that maybe is looking a little bit better as you're thinking about the next couple of quarters."", 'Douglas Swirsky', ""Thanks, Dan. This is Doug. So I think with respect to having an inventory drawdown, I think a lot of that was completed last year, and I certainly don't want to get ahead and speak too much about Q1. I think we're off to a reasonable start. This year, we are seeing some reasonable activity, particularly from SPL partners on pull through. And so I don't think that we're going to see. I don't think we have that same issue that we had last year about folks really working through inventory that they have built up in previous years."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Matt Larew, William Blair.', 'Matt Larew', ""Good evening. Sort of following up on Dan's question there and thinking about the cadence throughout the year. Most companies in the space have pointed to a much more back half loaded year. And you typically have done about I think, 43% of total revenue in the first half of the year. I'm just wondering if the split participating is any different than your historical level? And then if there's any discrepancies from a instrument versus a PA utilization perspective, particularly early on in the year, and we should be thinking about it."", 'Douglas Swirsky', ""Thanks for the question. This is Doug. So the way we've set our forecast for the year, we're not expecting any significant seasonality here come. So in terms of back weighting versus the front end of the year, we're not expecting any major seasonality here. If you will know, typically there have been reasons why Q4 usually is a little stronger that people are getting to the end of the year moving to the deployed budget, but was clear for us and maybe this speaks to the conservative nature for how we set guidance this year. There's absolutely no sort of recovery built into our forecasts, right versus the current market conditions. We're facing PA utilization for our forward guidance here based on where we came off of 2023. So I can't speak to how other companies set their guidance, but we certainly have not baked in any component that requires the industry to it significantly improved the macro environment for our client base this year, but does have and that represents some upside."", 'Matt Larew', ""Okay. And then just on VLX., obviously, that product was launched in fall 2022 sort of on a beta basis and took it out there in the market with select customers for some time at this point you're sort of referencing does I've gone back to the drawing board at least sort of reevaluating applications and commercial approaches. I'm just wondering what particular you think needs to be tweaked or added or subtracted from and to make that product find the right market?"", 'Maher Masoud', ""Yes. No, it's absolutely. So this is Maher. Obviously, it's not tweaking it, but we're taking the approach in the sense of very similar to what we did in the cell therapy space, right, which is when we entered the cell therapy space, which really took the time to understand the application needs of all of our customers, right? And so we're doing the exact same thing, the bioprosthetic space. So we're working with a few early adopters truly understanding where is the utilization the Vilex going to show the most promise in terms of applications and for which cell lines and how much, you know in terms of the production needs are going to be there for the BOX. So it's not working, right? So the engineering on the deal actually we have it's something that that's either weekly or when we launched it at the end of last year in order to showcase their ability to produce, translate produce protein and a significant amount. Now it's ensuring that we're working with several early adopters where we truly understand the applications that will allow us to launch into a much bigger market. So when I say tweaking, it's more learnings from our customers, just like with the cell therapy space. And it's more learnings of the MarketSoft to understand what we when we do more bus launch, how do we how do we ensure that that happens in a fashion where we're no longer work with early adopters that will work across prospecting of customer. So it's not squeaking. It's really understanding the market more than we have currently."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Mark Massaro, BTIG.', 'Mark Massaro', ""Hey, guys. Thank you for the questions. And congrats on a good start to the year with the new SPL.s added. I wanted to start on guidance. And Doug, I know you mentioned that your guide does not assume any improvement on our any end market improvement. I just wanted to double check that you're likely referring to improvement in cap and the capital raising environment and then related to that, I believe you guys indicated that capital raising environment is starting the year a little bit better than you expected. Could you please elaborate on that and maybe any comments on public companies versus private companies. Anything that you're seeing would be helpful"", 'Douglas Swirsky', ""Or can we take that in reverse order in terms of capital markets? Or will we go back to the first question, when I when I said improvement in the macro, I guess we really are talking about the capital availability for our customer base and at the end of the day, we can untether ourselves from the market we serve and provide enabling technology to. So as things are strong there from terms of having access to capital and that will help us last year, capital wasn't free flowing as much as it had been and you had companies rationalizing their pipeline, you've had people pausing some things. And I think that there is some signs of life here. We've seen some I mean we can talk about some specific financing that we've seen in the market. But I think you can certainly see what those were I am mostly referring to public companies. We do know that the private companies will have access to capital. But I think the way this typically works is you need some of the public companies to have some better results to do some financings that are viewed as successful by market participants and then perhaps that rolls that rolls down to some of the private companies. I think it's predominantly been the public companies that we've been able to observe specific announcements regarding significant financings for companies in the space to start the year we did not build into our forecast that the markets will improve. And while we've got some reasons to be encouraged based on what we've seen, it's still early days here in terms of how things are going to roll out for the year. And so again, we've taken a very conservative tried to set achievable goal for ourselves with this guidance to make sure that we are again, forecasting pull through, for instance, based on what it looked like last year. And that's just I think, the best way to do it. Obviously, we want to be in a position to achieve what we set out to do this year."", 'Mark Massaro', ""Okay, great. And then maybe just another guidance, clarification question on obviously, 2023 was a tough year for the full year, your car business was down 25%. It was a little worse than that in Q4, down 32%. So you know, for 2024 for you to guide flat to plus five, obviously does imply an improvement in trends. So yes, I guess what I'm trying to get at is what informs your assumption that you can come in flat to up this year. Can you just give us a sense of if you think a lot of the but the business will come in through PAs versus placements. And related to that, I think you placed 67 new systems last year versus 114 in the prior year. So just give us a sense for how much of this growth or flat to slightly up will come from PA consumption versus new system placements?"", 'Douglas Swirsky', ""We typically and we're not going to do a breakdown of that guidance in terms of the specific comments, but let me just remind you how we build this up because again, it's I think it gives you some comfort or some understanding of how we're thinking about the market and how that might impact utilization of our platform. So the three main components of core revenue are the leases for the instruments that are under the SPL. arrangements, it is the instrument, the instrument that sales to the other markets we serve. And of course, the PA revenue came from innovation. That is a pull through that. We're basing that analysis again on where we ended the year. We're looking at specifically what's the rate of PAs that we were selling at the end of the year and we said, let's be conservative. Let's look at that and roll that forward for 2024. Now, the instrument placements for the for 2024, we're building that up from specific identified opportunities that comes in through our commercial team that we model out is to determine what the likelihood of any particular opportunity is coming through, again, using what we think are improving assumptions about what's going to hit, and that's how we build off this revenue. So I can't specifically say how much of this is PA utilization, but I can say that the PA utilization that we're using to build that number up based on where we came out through the end of the year. And I recognize Q4 was tough on a year-over-year basis. It was certainly better in many ways for that to happen the third quarter."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Steven Mah, TD Cowen.', 'Steven Mah', ""Great. Thanks for taking the questions. On the SPL numbers in 2024, and I don't think you guys are guiding to a number, but how should we think about new scales in the year, given your historic three to five per year, especially that you're kind of already in that range with three already year to date? And then also given your comments that the SPL pipeline is robust?"", 'Maher Masoud', ""Yes, (inaudible) So obviously, we signed three this year and we're confident in what we've done in the past, which is three to four, three to five of the three this year doesn't mean that we're assigning three every quarter, right? So the way it normally works on these, as Kelly mentioned earlier, Randy's relationships oftentimes for the 9 months, 12 months, 18 months with the customer all the way. Through sometimes whether bolus where by the time that we've done across the Zama work for that customer where the rates become to go into SPL negotiations, you might have a bolus where you have a few customers that are signing around the same time. But overall, we're comfortable with the pipeline we've built that we can maintain the historical trend of that three to four plus number on an annual basis and that's what we're that's what we're guiding to right now as well. So you know that that three number I wouldn't take as three every quarter, but to help you know, were it not for the pipe, but."", 'Steven Mah', ""Yes, yes, no, no. Understood. And then maybe Maher, you talked about $1.9 billion in potential value from the from SPL partnerships in your portfolio are popping up from $1.5 billion last year. It has there been any internal changes to your NPV calculations in I know interest rates are trending down, maybe there's a better approval and regulatory environment which might improve probability of success and therefore, your discount rate, how should we think about Have there been any changes are you guys being conservative in your calculations."", 'Maher Masoud', ""So to be clear, and you know that that number that you reference is not a risk-adjusted number. So it's not discounted. It's not risk adjusted in any way on how we think about NPV of our programs. We do factor in those. Are those factors both is that the metric that you're that you're mentioning, Steve, does not include any discounting or risk adjustment. Is it strictly what is available to us under the SPL. agreements you had every item in there hit?"", 'Operator', 'Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Matt Hewitt, Craig-Hallum.', 'Matt Hewitt', ""Good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. Maybe to follow on one of the questions a couple of ago on I think you were acknowledging Q4 was tough when everybody knows that it was tough. But what are you seeing so far in the first quarter? Obviously the funding seems to be improving a little bit, but are you seeing that slight improvement in funding translate into some slight improvement in the PA utilization in the discussions that you're having with potential SPO customers?"", 'Maher Masoud', ""Yes. Hi, Matt. Let me take that for. So we are seeing that stabilization that we saw in Q4 really materialize in Q1 as well. And that's kind of the funding environment that's also been from our SPL in the customers that we believe will begin to trickle down into non-industrial customers. You saw a few of our customers are raising over $1 million recently in public offerings. So we're seeing that stabilization. In terms of the pure utilization, I'll let Doug speak to that. Obviously, with the stabilization, we're hoping that that continues throughout the year. So did you want to comment on the payer here."", 'Douglas Swirsky', ""I mean, let's just talk about where we are Q1. First off, just to recall, what we're talking about in response to a previous question is that at least, it has been a seasonality here in the cadence of the business. So there's nothing built in here that says, hey, as long as we have a big second half of the year, we're going to be able to achieve what we set out to do here. So given that we are sitting here a couple of weeks out from the end of the first quarter. We feel good about where we are today. We think we're on track."", 'Matt Hewitt', ""Got it. And then maybe a separate question on your partners have talked about on the there's a multistep process with kind of JV on the patient enrollment on the cell recovery, all of that, and it's multiple months with each of those steps. And hence, the I guess the desire or the need to be conservative at least this first year. But is it your expectation that as we get through and as your partners get more comfortable with that process that that time line shrinks. And so maybe you get a more normalized pattern of patient enrollment to patient treatment and the time line shrinks. So maybe '25 and beyond become more normalized, if you will. Yes."", 'Maher Masoud', ""Let me take that one, Matt. So the time line will shrink because that's the patient journey, whether it's now or in '25 or '26. But what will happen is as you have more patients that are having infusions, you will normalize in the sense of you have more patients now that are in any given month being treated with cash heavy. So it's not necessarily a crunch of the time line. It's more of a normalization in terms of the use of the cash usage for us. It is based on how many patients are being dosed, which we are hopeful that over the next year and then two years that you'll have more adoption of cash and we have more patients being treated on a monthly basis. So I hope that answers your question."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Maher Masoud, CEO, closing remarks."", 'Maher Masoud', 'Yes. No, thank you, everyone, for participating, and we look forward to speaking with everyone on our Q1 call.', 'Operator', ""Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect, and everyone have a great day.""]"

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad."", ""In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Textron (NYSE:TXT), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Textron ', ""If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Textron's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 53%. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens."", ""Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Textron maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 6.4% to US$14b. That's progress."", ""You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting."", ""Since Textron has a market capitalisation of US$18b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. With a whopping US$87m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders."", ""Textron's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, Textron is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed.

With that in mind, the ROCE of Waste Management (NYSE:WM) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Waste Management:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.13 = US$3.8b ÷ (US$33b - US$4.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Therefore, Waste Management has an ROCE of 13%.

Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 13% and the business has deployed 46% more capital into its operations. 13% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Waste Management has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns."", 'To sum it up, Waste Management has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return.

Going by our model, we expect Bio-Rad's Life Science arm to register a decline of 1% in 2024.In the fourth quarter of 2023, negative BioPharma macro trends persisted.

The company posted a 19.7% year-over-year decline in its operating profit in the fourth quarter.', 'Added to this, Bio-Rad operates in a highly competitive environment, dominated by firms ranging from large multinational corporations with significant resources to start-ups. Also, the competitive and regulatory conditions in the markets where the company operates limit Bio-Rad’s ability to switch to strategies like price hikes and other drivers of cost increases. Further, the extension of the public tender commitments to multiple years by the government, resulting in a reduced number of annual tenders, has led to aggressive tender pricing by Bio-Rad’s competitors.

This partnership enabled these manufacturers’ machines to become Tide Cold Certified, which means they have a feature on them that Tide scientists have tested to deliver a better clean in cold with Tide. Washing with cold water reduces energy use, saves people money and extends the life of clothing, but despite this, 43% of laundry loads in North America are still being washed in hot or warm water.', 'When people switch from hot to cold water washing, they use up to 90% less energy in the wash cycle on average and save money on their yearly energy bills.

This initiative can further advance Tide’s Ambition of turning three out of four loads of laundry to cold water washing in the U.S. and Canada by 2030.', '""At Electrolux Group, we are proud to be part of the collective effort to raise awareness of the many benefits of washing in cold with Tide, such as reduced energy costs, fewer carbon emissions and increased clothing longevity, all while effectively eliminating those hard-to-remove stains,"" said CEO of Electrolux Group North America Ricardo Cons.

In fact, one of my earliest memories is helping my father building and fixing computers in our home garage. Tinkering with computers is a passion that I seem to have inherited and have since built upon. As a child I quickly gained knowledge and skills to trouble-shoot operating systems from old manuals that were the size of telephone directories! And for those of you who don't know what they are, they're huge! As an adult, I now look back and realise that my childhood obsession and interest in technology was a part of my undiagnosed Autism Spectrum Disorder trait that would form a key part of my identity later in life."", 'Upheavals of migration', 'My parents migrated from Pakistan, upheaving their entire lives just to educate their daughter. My mother gave me a strong sense of conviction and the foundation to pursue hard challenges and set targets. As a woman, she embedded a strong belief in me to pursue education, to be independent and most importantly, to lead a life in purposeful service, leaving a good legacy for future generations. My parents wanted me to pursue medicine, which I directed my studies towards. But I had no idea that one day I would go back to my original dream and passion of technology.', 'Delving into programming', ""During my teenage years, I delved into programming when my teacher enrolled me into the inaugural Google Python competition. This involved creating html and CSS websites which exposed me to technical challenges and problem solving. As students, we were given Lego robotics kits to construct robots with a small touch censor and a black and white camera for the robot to look at targets ahead. Our goal was to code a sensor program so that the robot could turn and avoid obstacles. These experiences not only honed my technical skills but further instilled in me a sense of curiosity and a love for hands-on problem-solving. The passion for robotics naturally led me to develop a very strong interest in AI. At high school, I loved science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects and applied for a bachelor's degree in science at UOW after I finished my final year."", 'Coding, COVID, and cyber career change', 'At UOW, I majored in chemistry and I did a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering at TAFE NSW Wollongong. At the time, I only continued coding and pen-testing courses as a hobby. After graduating, I had a brief stint as a chemical engineer which I enjoyed immensely. However, after I was laid off during the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to go back to my old job as an early childcare educator and considered teaching as a career change.', ""I had started doing a Master's in Education until one day an advertisement on Reddit caught my eye. The ad promoted a UOW / Deloitte Cyber Academy Program for new school leavers and mature age students, paying them to study a degree in computer science at UOW, a Diploma in IT at TAFE NSW and to work at a big four company. Such possibilities seemed insurmountable, yet I applied for it and after the year-long application process, I finally got in."", ""The program consisted of a two-week bootcamp before coursework commenced. I completed the Fundamentals of Networking [Networking Essentials] course through Cisco Networking Academy, one of the world's longest-running and purpose-driven IT skills-to-jobs programs. My teacher, Shan Ansari, nominated me for the Cisco Dream Team as I was able to pick up networking concepts quickly, asked a lot of questions, and was very quick to problem solve the Cisco Packet Tracer lab exercises. He wrote me a wonderful recommendation letter and I applied for the Dream Team; it was a very last-minute application!"", ""You're dreaming!"", ""Honestly, I was gobsmacked when I heard that I got into the Cisco Dream Team. My TAFE teacher told me that I was the first TAFE student to make it into the Dream Team and that is a highly coveted experience to obtain in the IT industry. The Dream Team went to three workshops where we gained hands-on experience of how to do cabling and basic troubleshooting. It was the first time for me to meet the all-female Dream Team which included the all-female Dream Team which included six women from all across Australia. The workshops were very informative as we were all enrolled into Cisco Networking Academy's CCNA course, and we physically learnt how to do cabling and work with Cisco equipment. This was my dream coming true:"", 'I had always wanted to study and apply my technical knowledge but this was at a whole new level, at a major sporting event!', ""The Dream Team event went over seven days. We were split into two teams to cover the cabling at both event stadiums: Stadium Australia and Homebush Stadium. The Dream Team shadowed the Swisscom team which was in charge of planning and installing the IT infrastructure using Cisco equipment. We were given the schematics of the media tribune area, and we spent our time setting-up the equipment in order for the media to have reliable high-speed internet throughout the coverage of the FIFA Women's World Cup. The Dream Team also set up wireless access points near the area of play. On the day of the opening match of France vs Jamaica, the Dream Team gathered with the Swisscom team to troubleshoot the match in real-time. Seeing how a major event is put together behind the scenes, from the infrastructure and planning and sheer scale of people working, was a life-changing experience for me. Fortunately, the opening match coverage went smoothly without any issues and it was a fantastic learning opportunity."", 'Cisco recognition', 'The feeling of contributing to such a monumental event brought a wave of emotions over me. The camaraderie among the Dream Team members and the recognition from Cisco executives made me realise the numerous opportunities and pathways for women in IT.', ""Cisco's all-female Dream Team received coverage in the national newspapers, industry press, and my local hometown regional newspapers. I even got the opportunity to share my experience on the ABC Illawarra radio station. This opportunity has opened up so many career pathways and recognition that I am truly grateful for. My advice to anybody starting in IT is to seize the opportunity to upskill and retrain. IT is a pathway for women that can provide more options and greater flexibility than many others, and all your knowledge that you gain throughout your career can be utilised to solve the most unique problems and create innovative solutions. Always be curious, be resilient under the face of challenges and always have a creative flair in your work."", ""I hope this story serves as an inspiration for those navigating the tech landscape. As I reflect on my own path, it's heartening to know that the skills I developed in my formative years played a crucial role in my more recent success. The FIFA Women's World Cup made Australian TV history. The Cisco Dream Team journey stands as a testament to the limitless possibilities that unfold when childhood passions meet curiosity and resilience."", 'Register to hear Noor and others on Women Rock-IT', 'View original content here.', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc Email: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"
