2,59a30aa5-362b-327f-8eec-f34a3ceb12af,TXN,2022-12-31,Investors in Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) have made a respectable return of 73% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-texas-instruments-nasdaq-txn-110030167.html,1672484430,STORY,['TXN'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, long term Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) shareholders have enjoyed a 51% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 31% (not including dividends).Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Texas Instruments managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 9% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Texas Instruments has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Texas Instruments' TSR for the last 5 years was 73%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Texas Instruments shares lost 9.9% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 22%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 12% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Texas Instruments better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Texas Instruments (including 2 which are significant) .If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

However, in the case of loss-making companies that have a negative price-to-earnings ratio, the price-to-sales or P/S ratio is considered in determining their true value.However, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), though used less often, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with great returns.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. PVH Corp. PVH, Signet Jewelers SIG, Unum Group UNM, Aercap AER and Sterling Infrastructure STRL are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.Story continuesBut there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:PVH Corp. specializes in designing and marketing branded dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear, jeanswear, intimate apparel, swim products, footwear, handbags and related products.PVH Corp. has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.

Shares have lost about 3.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PVH due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.PVH Corp Q3 Earnings &amp; Revenues Beat on Brand StrengthPVH Corp reported third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, both metrics declined year over year.Results gained from the continued momentum in its core brands — Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger — along with pricing actions. However, the ongoing macroeconomic challenges, particularly in Europe, and continued COVID impacts in Asia remained headwinds.That said, management remains on track with its PVH+ Plan, which aims at product strength and consumer engagement, direct-to-consumer, digital enhancement and improving its supply-chain capabilities, which are likely to result in substantial cost efficiencies and better productivity.Q3 HighlightsPVH Corp reported adjusted earnings of $2.60 per share, down 2.6% from the year-ago quarter's $2.67. However, the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13. On a GAAP basis, the company reported a loss of $2.88 per share against earnings of $3.89 in the prior-year quarter.In the fiscal third quarter, revenues fell 2% year over year (up 7% on a cc basis) to $2,281 million. This is mainly due to the impacts of the Ukraine war, such as Russia store closures, the cessation of wholesale shipments to Russia and Belarus, and a reduction in wholesale shipments to Ukraine. However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,232 million.On the flip side, the company witnessed growth across all regions and in its Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brand businesses. Strength in its international businesses, as well as improvements in North America, particularly in the direct-to-consumer business, acted as other upsides.Direct-to-consumer revenues fell 5% year over year in the quarter, whereas Wholesale revenues plunged 2%. Revenues in the digital channel declined roughly 12% in the quarter under review.The company's gross profits amounted to $1,274.2 million, down 5.3% year over year. The gross margin contracted 180 bps to 55.9% due to higher costs and increased promotions, which more than offset gains from price increases. This also includes unfavorable currency impacts of 40 bps.Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2% year over year to $1,068.3 million. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes totaled $220 million compared with $266 million in the prior-year quarter. This mainly resulted from reduced expenses in the prior-year period due to store closures in certain regions. The metric also included $30 million of adverse foreign currency impacts.Story continuesSegmental AnalysisPVH Corp reports financial results under three segments — Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands.Revenues from the Calvin Klein segment inched up 1% year over year. Sales from Calvin Klein North America fell 4% while the same for Calvin Klein International rose 9%.Revenues from the Tommy Hilfiger segment declined 4% year over year in the reported quarter. Revenues were up 12% at Tommy Hilfiger North America while the metric declined 10% at Tommy Hilfiger International.The Heritage Brands segment's revenues plunged 4% year over year in the quarter under review.Financial DetailsPVH Corp ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $457 million, long-term debt of $2,109.1 million, and stockholders' equity of $4,822.8 million. The company also bought back $102 million of shares under its existing $3-billion share repurchase program in the quarter under review.OutlookManagement revised its fiscal 2022 outlook and issued the fiscal fourth-quarter view. For fiscal 2022, revenues are anticipated to be at the higher end of the earlier mentioned year-over-year decrease of 3-4% (up 3-4% on a cc basis). This is inclusive of a 2% reduction each for the exit of the Heritage Brands Retail business and the war in Ukraine.The bottom line is expected to be $8.25 for the year, up from the $8.00 per share mentioned earlier. However, the company reported $10.15 last year. Interest expenses are likely to be $85 million, suggesting a decline from the prior year’s reported figure of $104 million. Also, the effective tax rate is expected to be 64% on a GAAP basis and 24% on an adjusted basis.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, management expects a 4% year-over-year revenue decline. This is inclusive of a 2% decline from the war in Ukraine. The bottom line is likely to be 45 cents on a GAAP basis and $1.65 on an adjusted basis. Notably, the company reported $3.89 and $2.67 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. This includes unfavorable currency impacts of 27 cents, as well as 15 cents of adverse impacts of the Ukraine war.Interest expenses for the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to remain flat year over year. Notably, it reported $24 million in the year-ago period. The effective tax rate is expected to be 80% on a GAAP basis and 25% on an adjusted basis.Business DevelopmentPVH Corp announced the extension of its license agreements with G-III Apparel Group from 2025 to 2027. The deal will enable the smooth transition of core product categories back to PVH at the end of the extended terms.The transaction mainly includes Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands in the United States and Canada, particularly the women’s North American wholesale business. The move is part of the PVH+ plan, which is a multi-year strategic growth plan to unlock the full potential of the company’s two iconic brands in the North American market.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -9.91% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, PVH has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, PVH has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

8,1a38a8c7-fab0-361c-a343-487c8d081629,CF,2022-12-31,Are Options Traders Betting on a Big Move in CF Industries (CF) Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/options-traders-betting-big-move-133401079.html,1672407241,STORY,['CF'],"[Investors in CF Industries Holdings, Inc. CF need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $15.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for CF Industries shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, CF Industries is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Fertilizers industry that ranks in the Bottom 4% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $4.74 per share to $4.26 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about CF Industries right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

While the most savvy of shoppers will go hunting for the best deals on items sold at Walmart, not all of them are created equal, especially when it comes to the mega-retailer’s very own brand items.Read More: 11 Grocery Items To Buy at Dollar TreeDo You Have a Tax Question? Ask a Tax ProMore: 3 Ways Smart People Save Money When Filing Their TaxesLike all stores, Walmart has things you definitely should buy and shouldn’t buy on its shelves. However, if you put the retailer’s in-store merchandise under the microscope and examine everything from quality to price, this is what you should definitely not spend your money on at Walmart.1. Nut ButtersWhen it comes to spreads you should always have in your pantry, Nutella, peanut and almond butters are the ones that must be in stock. But Walmart’s nut butters aren’t really hitting their mark when it comes to price.A 16-ounce Walmart Great Value Organic Creamy Stir Peanut Butter is typically $4.47 and a 12-ounce Sam’s Choice Honey Almond Butter goes for $5.22, while The Krazy Coupon Lady found similar bulk items for less at Costco. Pennies may not make a difference on one grocery bill, but if it’s a staple it’ll add up over time.Take Our Poll: How Do You Think the Economy Will Perform in 2023?2. Rotisserie ChickensOkay, so the price point between a Costco rotisserie chicken and a Walmart one isn’t too far off, with both warehouse brands listing their birds for around $5 each. However, Costco has more poultry per pound, weighing in on an average of about 4 to 5 pounds, compared to Walmart’s nugget of 3 pounds.Besides, everyone always raves about how good Costco’s rotisserie chickens are and when “Eat This, Not That!” put several of these flavorful fouls up against each other, Walmart’s chicken came in at the bottom of the list.3. SweetenersHoney? Syrup? Can there really be that big of a difference on these items or where you get them? If you are shopping at Walmart, you might not like the answer, particularly if you are trying to buy them in bulk.Story continuesCostco sells their wildflower honey for on average at about 26 cents per ounce, meaning you can buy their 5-pound option for just under $22. Compare that with Walmart’s Great Value honey that costs about 33 cents per ounce, with a 12-ounce bottle for around $3.94. You just get more bang for your buck at Costco — especially since honey lasts a long time.If you think that’s a sticky situation, Walmart is known for having non-organic maple syrup cost almost 56 cents per ounce in some locations. Consumer Reports found that Costco’s Kirkland Signature USDA Organic Grade-A brand “is 25% less than the name brand,” and was the best deal of all the generic syrups they tested.4. Toilet PaperThe price of Walmart’s Great Value toilet paper is not bad, but this is an item you may not want to opt for the cheap version of. According to Consumer Reports, “It costs a lot less — 6 cents per 100 sheets compared to 25 cents — but in this case, you get what you pay for.”During a product test, Consumer Reports noted that: “Walmart’s dubiously named Great Value Bathroom Tissue was neither soft nor strong, and it didn’t disintegrate well. It scored a lowly 9 out of a possible 100.”5. Gift CardsWhile not technically classified as “Walmart brand,” gift cards at Walmart are actually pricier when you buy them there. That’s because Walmart sells them at list price, otherwise known as “at face-value.” This means that if you pop into another big warehouse store like Costco, you can purchase a multi-pack with about a 15%-20% markdown.6. SupplementsMany supplements are sold across numerous stores in the U.S. and it’s up to consumers to check if they’ve been FDA approved, as well as what’s in them. But when it comes to buying Walmart’s store-brand supplements, you might be unknowingly putting yourself at risk due to the inconsistent amounts of vitamins and minerals in the supplements.Walmart — among a few other big retailers — was cited in a 2015 statement by the New York State Office of the Attorney General saying that the sale of their store-brand herbal supplement products “could not be verified to contain the labeled substance, or which were found to contain ingredients not listed on the labels.”Save your health and your money by skipping out on these purchases.7. SnacksWalmart’s Great Value snacks seem to be the perfect accompaniment for a lazy day on your couch binging Netflix. But take a closer look and you may not be impressed.In reading the unit size and quantity, you’ll see that the Great Value versions are priced similar to better-known name-brand items, so why not go all out and treat yourself with what you already know to be delicious?This quality comparison extends to other fun foods like cereal, too.“There is nothing like the taste of Lucky Charms, Trix, Coco Puffs or Apple Jacks and it is easily recognizable when you grew up eating them,” says Juliette Furla of Spoon University in her taste testing report of Walmart’s Great Value brand cereals. “Great Value just didn’t have the good ol’ taste we know and love.”More From GOBankingRatesWays You Can Lose Your Social Security BenefitsDo You Have a Tax Question?

Let’s dive into Dollar Tree DLTR and Walmart WMT stock as we round out the year and see if their low-cost offerings can capitalize on this scenario going into 2023.Recent Performance Dollar Tree stock was virtually flat this year vs. Walmart’s -2% drop in 2022. While this is not an overwhelmingly strong performance both stocks have been defensive at times and outperformed the broader market with the S&amp;P 500 down -20% this year. Over the last two years, DLTR is up +31% to impressively outperform WMT and the benchmark. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDollar Tree’s low-price offerings for consumer merchandise at $1.25 per item have been ideal for many consumers to escape higher inflation. Dollar Tree stores raised their price offerings from $1.00 per item to improve margin and combat rising operating costs amid higher inflation. The company’s Family Dollar segment is also a viable option for savings and features a broader range of competitively priced merchandise which usually doesn’t exceed the $10 range.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDollar Tree has taken advantage of the current market environment beating earnings estimates for all three of its current fiscal year quarterly reports. In fact, DLTR’s earnings have beaten the Zacks consensus for 12 consecutive quarters dating back to March 2020.Walmart is a well-known option for consumer saving as well, famous for its rollback prices and price match guarantees that cross from basic consumer merchandise and household products to electronics, groceries, and home furnishing.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnlike Dollar Tree, Walmart hasn’t shown quite the same consistency in its bottom line. Walmart has beat earnings expectations in its last two quarters but missed its fiscal first-quarter expectations earlier in the year after facing excess inventory challenges.Story continuesGrowth &amp; OutlookDespite an impressive string of earnings beats even Dollar Tree stock has hit some rough patches throughout the year after lowering its full-year earnings outlook in August.Still, Dollar Tree earnings are expected to climb 24% in its current fiscal 2023 and jump another 9% in FY24 to $7.85 per share. Earnings estimates have trended down over the last 60 days. Sales are projected to be up 7% in FY23 and rise another 6% in FY24 to $29.85 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPivoting to Walmart, earnings are forecasted to decline -6% in FY23 but rise 8% in FY24 at $6.55 per share. Even better, earnings estimates have gone up for both FY23 and FY24 over the last 60 days. On the top line, sales are projected to be up 6% in FY23 and rise another 3% in FY24 to $623.76 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation  With Dollar Tree and Walmart stocks looking like viable investment options in 2023 based on their growth, monitoring their valuation will be important. On that note, both Dollar Tree and Walmart stock trade around $140 per share at the moment with DLTR trading at 19.9X forward earnings and WMT at a 23.3X forward earnings multiple.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDollar Tree appears to have a slight edge in valuation as it trades 38% below its decade high of 32.5X and near the median of 19.1X. Walmart on the other hand trades 17% beneath its decade-long high of 28.1X but 30% above the median of 18.1X.DividendsIn the current market environment, dividends also come in handy and Walmart evens the playing field in this regard. Dollar Tree doensn't  offer a dividend to shareholders at the moment as the company continues to focus on growth and expansion of its store fronts. WMT pays a respectable 1.58% annual dividend yield at $2.24 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineBoth Dollar Tree and Walmart stock land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. Both stocks look like solid investments going into 2023 and may continue to outperform the broader market. More upside in DLTR and WMT stock may largely depend upon their fourth-quarter earnings reports, but holding these equities could prove beneficial for investors as consumers look to save.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now, Tesco PLC is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Walmart has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that TSCDY's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.TSCDY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.03, while WMT has a forward P/E of 23.39. We also note that TSCDY has a PEG ratio of 3.54. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. WMT currently has a PEG ratio of 4.25.Another notable valuation metric for TSCDY is its P/B ratio of 1.22. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, WMT has a P/B of 4.78.These metrics, and several others, help TSCDY earn a Value grade of A, while WMT has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesTSCDY is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that TSCDY is likely the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:MMC) insiders disposed of US$3.0m worth of stock",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-marsh-mclennan-120050527.html,1672488050,STORY,['MMC'],"[Over the past year, many Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Marsh &amp; McLennan CompaniesOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Dean Klisura, for US$1.5m worth of shares, at about US$172 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$165. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).In the last year Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies. In total, insiders sold US$2.5m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$199m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies and we suggest you have a look.But note: Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies may not be the best stock to buy.

Accretive pricing policies and robust demand across end markets are aiding the Aftermarket business. Aerospace and defense end markets are driven by strength in new equipment and replacement parts, as the commercial aerospace industry continues to recover from the pandemic-related softness. The Industrial Products segment is benefiting from robust industrial filtration solutions and gas turbine systems' sales.Donaldson’s acquisition of Purilogics, LLC (June 2022) strengthened its life sciences portfolio by leveraging the acquired entity’s unique product offerings. The acquisition of Solaris Biotechnology (in November 2021) strengthened its presence across several end markets, including food and beverage, biopharma, and other major life sciences. Also, DCI acquired Pearson Arnold Industrial Services in the same month. Acquired assets are strengthening DCI’s top line.The company’s measures to reward its shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks are noteworthy. Donaldson paid out dividends worth $110.1 million in fiscal 2022 (ended July 2022) and $28.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended October 2022). The company repurchased shares worth $170.6 million in fiscal 2022 and $45.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

Due to the essential nature of the business, demand remains robust.

Owing to strong demand, price realization and gradual easing of supply-chain constraints, XYL raised its adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2022 to $2.65-$2.75 compared with $2.50-$2.70 anticipated earlier. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company now expects revenues to increase approximately 4% on a reported basis and 9-10% on an organic basis compared with organic revenue growth and reported revenue increase of 8-10% and 3-5% estimated earlier.Solid global demand across end markets is supporting Xylem’s top line. The Water Infrastructure segment is benefiting from effective price realization, robust transport demand in Western Europe and healthy activity in the wastewater utility business in the United States and Western Europe. For 2022, the company expects high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure.The Applied Water segment is gaining from strong price realization and backlog execution in industrial, commercial and residential end markets. The company expects low double-digit growth in Applied Water.  Measurement &amp; Control Solutions is benefiting from robust demand in the advanced metering infrastructure end market and modest improvement in chip supply. The company predicts the segment’s sales to increase in mid-single digits for the year.Xylem’s commitment to reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks is encouraging. In the first nine months of 2022, Xylem paid out dividends worth $163 million, reflecting an increase of 7.2% year over year. The company also bought back shares worth $52 million in the same period.

US oil prices are on track for another year of gains, small gains. And that's despite tight supplies caused by Russia's war with Ukraine and weakening demand from the world's top crude importer. That would be China due to lockdowns.Joining us now for more is Lipow Oil Associates founder and president Andrew Lipow. Andy, great to have you here as always. I'm looking at your price target and where you think WTI and Brent are going to go. You're saying WTI could go to $90. That's about $10 above the current price, and Brent also a similar amount, to 95. Just wondering what factors into your analysis here.ANDY LIPOW: Well, we have a lot of things that are happening in the oil market. First, if we were to look at the demand side of the equation, the two things that the oil market is wrestling with is, number one, is the reopening of the Chinese economy as the lockdowns are eased. But I don't think that we're going to see a real big impact of that reopening until the middle of next year. But it could be worth about 500,000 to 700,000 barrels a day of additional demand.But on the other side of that demand picture is the fears of a recession, especially in Europe, as they're coping with high energy prices from natural gas, as well as high oil prices as they seek oil products to replace that natural gas supply from Russia. Meanwhile, on the supply side, in 2022, the world has really been making its way through with Strategic Petroleum Reserve releases in the United States, as well as elsewhere around the world. And if we look across the year, that has really added about 3/4 of a million barrels a day of supply.As we go forward, these lower oil prices that we've seen recently are going to impact the supply growth we're expecting in the United States, where the Energy Information Administration has been continually revising downward their growth forecasts of increased supplies here in the US now to about 500,000 barrels a day, whereas one time, several months ago, it was as high as 900,000 barrels a day increase.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Andy, when you take a look at where prices are today, we have WTI crude just around 80 bucks a barrel. We certainly have seen this movement to the upside over the last several days. The winter storm over the holiday, I guess, how big of a factor has that been for supply?ANDY LIPOW: Well, this has been a pretty big impact, especially on refined products. At its peak, nearly 2 million barrels a day of Texas Gulf Coast refining capacity was offline. That's about 35% of the Texas refining capacity. So of course, if the refineries aren't running, they're not making gasoline and diesel.When we think about on the production of oil, the blizzards in North Dakota took off about 300,000 barrels a day of production, which will slowly recover, but more seriously, on the natural gas side, we lost about 10% to 15% of our natural gas production throughout the country, as the cold weather impacted those fields in Texas and Oklahoma, all the way up through Appalachia.JARED BLIKRE: Andy, I want to ask you about those sanctions that we were talking about a little bit. Just touch on them against Russian oil. Those seem to be largely symbolic. And the net effect is that we do have oil, low priced oil being piped into Europe from the Urals. But what do you see in the new year? If things escalate with respect to Russia, Ukraine again, could we get another situation where we see crude, at least momentarily, spike up well above your price targets for the end of the year?ANDY LIPOW: Well, it certainly could happen because in 2022, we saw oil prices for WTI get to $130 a barrel. So there can be a significant amount of volatility in the oil market. We had the European Union impose their sanctions on Russian crude oil purchases starting December 5. Now what I'm looking ahead to is February 5th when the sanctions begin on Russian refined products, and more specifically, on diesel supply, where Europe has been buying about 700,000 barrels a day of diesel from Russia.So there is going to be a scramble for new supplies to backfill those lost supplies that are available-- have been available out of Russia. And we're going to be looking towards new refining expansions and capacity coming online in the Middle East, as well as China, in order to make up the difference.SEANA SMITH: Andy, when you look over at what's happening in China, of course, we've had the surge in cases, lots of questions about how extensively, or I guess, how much that could really hold back the reopening there. When it comes to the impact that you see that having on crude, could we potentially maybe not hit your target and actually end up below 90 bucks a barrel at the end of 2023?ANDY LIPOW: We certainly could, especially if the return of Chinese demand becomes a disappointment, and the economic factors around the rest of the world cause a deeper recession than people are calling for. And you could actually see oil prices plummet. And we saw that happen in 2008 and 2009, as well as in 2014 and 2015, where we saw oil prices back in the $30 a barrel range and $45 a barrel range respectively.SEANA SMITH: All right, Andy, always great to have you.

Relative strength shows which sectors or individual issues are outperforming market peers. In general, 2022 was a terrible year for the stock market, and with rising interest rates and recessionary fears, most real estate investment trusts (REITs) did not fare well.But some pockets of relative strength are beginning to emerge among the universe of REITs, and income investors who are looking ahead to 2023 would be wise to consider those REITs that have recently shown the greatest relative strength.With that in mind, take a look at the four best-performing REITs in December, a group whose recent track record could put them at the head of the class for gains in 2023.Braemar Hotels &amp; Resorts (NYSE: BHR) is a Dallas-based REIT that invests in luxury hotels and resorts across the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. Braemar Hotels &amp; Resorts now has investments in 17 properties with over 4,200 rooms.Braemar Hotels &amp; Resorts was a very poor performer over the first 11 months of 2022, losing 31% of its value. But it bounced back strongly this month, rising 11.41% to lead all REITs in December.The main driver of its price rise was Braemar Hotels &amp; Resorts announcing a stock repurchase program of up to $25 million. In addition, the board of directors gave shareholders an early holiday present when it declared an increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.01 to $0.05 per share. Braemar Hotels &amp; Resorts also announced the closing on its acquisition of the Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale at Troon North Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona.AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ: AGNC) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based mortgage REIT (mREIT) that invests in U.S. government-guaranteed pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. It pays a monthly dividend of $0.12 per share, and the $1.44 annual payment yields 13.7% on its most recent closing price.Story continuesDespite analyst downgrades in December from Zacks Investment Research and Ford Equity Research, as well as a negative comment by Jim Cramer on “Mad Money,” AGNC Investment Corp. still managed to gain 4% this month, following up on a 21% rise in November after beating expectations on its third-quarter earnings report.One reason for the price increase was the announcement that billionaire Bond King Bill Gross was buying shares of AGNC and Annaly Capital Management Inc. (NYSE: NLY).Getty Realty Corp. (NYSE: GTY) is a Jericho, New York-based retail REIT that specializes in owning, leasing and financing 1,021 free-standing auto-related properties across 38 states and Washington, D.C.Almost three-quarters of Getty Realty’s properties are gas stations and convenience stores. Another 12% are car washes, and 11% are automotive repair shops, with the remainder being auto service and auto parts stores. At the end of the third quarter, its property occupancy rate was 99.6%.Getty Realty has been on a tear the last few months after a good third-quarter report and increasing its dividend from $1.58 per year to a forward $1.72 during 2022.Getty Realty shares were up 3.02% in December.Realty Income Corp. (NYSE: O) is a San Diego-based retail REIT that owns and operates over 11,400 commercial properties worldwide with long-term net lease contracts in which the tenant is responsible for the majority of operating costs, including taxes, insurance and maintenance.Realty Income’s tenant list includes large, well-known investment-grade companies, such as Walgreens Co., Dollar General Corp. (NYSE: DG), FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR). Investors know that even if 2023 brings about a hard recession, these are companies that will not have difficulty paying rent. As of the third quarter, Realty Income’s rent collection on investment-grade tenants was 99.9%.Realty Income is one of 65 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, meaning it’s increased its dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.Driving Realty Income’s shares higher this month was the news that Gregory J. Whyte has been appointed executive vice president and chief operating officer beginning Jan. 3. In addition, Realty Income declared its 628th consecutive monthly dividend and increased its dividend from $0.248 to $0.2485 per share.Realty Income gained 1.94% in December and looks like it could continue its success this month into 2023.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

Despite posting their worst monthly showing in four years in December, prices notched the longest streak of annual gains, according to Refinitiv data. The contract has added about 20% in what has been tipped as the most volatile year for the commodity, having surpassed the $10 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) level for the first time in 14 years. Prices halved since then, however, with the contract settling down 8.4 cents, or 1.8%, at $4.475/mmBtu on Friday, pressured by record-high U.S. output and milder weather which has reduced demand for heating. The contract hit its lowest level since March 1 during the session and marked its worst quarterly loss in a year. ""With warmer than normal weather ahead of us, I believe the draws for the next several weeks are going to be much lower than the five-year average, especially for the first week of January,"" said Zhen​ Zhu, managing consultant at C.H. Guernsey and Co in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Data provider Refinitiv estimated 345 heating degree days (HDDs) over the next two weeks in the lower 48 U.S. states. The normal is 440 HDDs for this time of year. HDDs estimate demand to heat homes and businesses by measuring the number of degrees a day's average temperature is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 C). ""Until there is solid enough evidence that more bitterly cold weather is on the cusp of dominating the bulk of the nation, it’s likely that gas market bears will continue to keep adding downside pressure on prices,"" Gelber &amp; Associates said in a note. Market participants are also keenly awaiting the restart of the long-shut Freeport LNG liquefied natural gas export plant in Texas, in the second half of January, pending regulatory approval.

US oil prices are on track for another year of gains, small gains. And that's despite tight supplies caused by Russia's war with Ukraine and weakening demand from the world's top crude importer. That would be China due to lockdowns.Joining us now for more is Lipow Oil Associates founder and president Andrew Lipow. Andy, great to have you here as always. I'm looking at your price target and where you think WTI and Brent are going to go. You're saying WTI could go to $90. That's about $10 above the current price, and Brent also a similar amount, to 95. Just wondering what factors into your analysis here.ANDY LIPOW: Well, we have a lot of things that are happening in the oil market. First, if we were to look at the demand side of the equation, the two things that the oil market is wrestling with is, number one, is the reopening of the Chinese economy as the lockdowns are eased. But I don't think that we're going to see a real big impact of that reopening until the middle of next year. But it could be worth about 500,000 to 700,000 barrels a day of additional demand.But on the other side of that demand picture is the fears of a recession, especially in Europe, as they're coping with high energy prices from natural gas, as well as high oil prices as they seek oil products to replace that natural gas supply from Russia. Meanwhile, on the supply side, in 2022, the world has really been making its way through with Strategic Petroleum Reserve releases in the United States, as well as elsewhere around the world. And if we look across the year, that has really added about 3/4 of a million barrels a day of supply.As we go forward, these lower oil prices that we've seen recently are going to impact the supply growth we're expecting in the United States, where the Energy Information Administration has been continually revising downward their growth forecasts of increased supplies here in the US now to about 500,000 barrels a day, whereas one time, several months ago, it was as high as 900,000 barrels a day increase.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Andy, when you take a look at where prices are today, we have WTI crude just around 80 bucks a barrel. We certainly have seen this movement to the upside over the last several days. The winter storm over the holiday, I guess, how big of a factor has that been for supply?ANDY LIPOW: Well, this has been a pretty big impact, especially on refined products. At its peak, nearly 2 million barrels a day of Texas Gulf Coast refining capacity was offline. That's about 35% of the Texas refining capacity. So of course, if the refineries aren't running, they're not making gasoline and diesel.When we think about on the production of oil, the blizzards in North Dakota took off about 300,000 barrels a day of production, which will slowly recover, but more seriously, on the natural gas side, we lost about 10% to 15% of our natural gas production throughout the country, as the cold weather impacted those fields in Texas and Oklahoma, all the way up through Appalachia.JARED BLIKRE: Andy, I want to ask you about those sanctions that we were talking about a little bit. Just touch on them against Russian oil. Those seem to be largely symbolic. And the net effect is that we do have oil, low priced oil being piped into Europe from the Urals. But what do you see in the new year? If things escalate with respect to Russia, Ukraine again, could we get another situation where we see crude, at least momentarily, spike up well above your price targets for the end of the year?ANDY LIPOW: Well, it certainly could happen because in 2022, we saw oil prices for WTI get to $130 a barrel. So there can be a significant amount of volatility in the oil market. We had the European Union impose their sanctions on Russian crude oil purchases starting December 5. Now what I'm looking ahead to is February 5th when the sanctions begin on Russian refined products, and more specifically, on diesel supply, where Europe has been buying about 700,000 barrels a day of diesel from Russia.So there is going to be a scramble for new supplies to backfill those lost supplies that are available-- have been available out of Russia. And we're going to be looking towards new refining expansions and capacity coming online in the Middle East, as well as China, in order to make up the difference.SEANA SMITH: Andy, when you look over at what's happening in China, of course, we've had the surge in cases, lots of questions about how extensively, or I guess, how much that could really hold back the reopening there. When it comes to the impact that you see that having on crude, could we potentially maybe not hit your target and actually end up below 90 bucks a barrel at the end of 2023?ANDY LIPOW: We certainly could, especially if the return of Chinese demand becomes a disappointment, and the economic factors around the rest of the world cause a deeper recession than people are calling for. And you could actually see oil prices plummet. And we saw that happen in 2008 and 2009, as well as in 2014 and 2015, where we saw oil prices back in the $30 a barrel range and $45 a barrel range respectively.SEANA SMITH: All right, Andy, always great to have you.

Shares have lost about 9.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Salesforce.com due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Salesforce Q3 Earnings and Revenues Beat EstimatesSalesforce reported strong financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein its revenues and earnings surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and marked a solid year-over-year improvement as well.Third-Quarter Fiscal 2023 PerformanceSalesforce’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings of $1.40 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. The quarterly earnings included a benefit of 2 cents per share from the mark-to-mark accounting of CRM’s strategic investments at a non-GAAP tax rate of 25%. Moreover, non-GAAP earnings soared 10% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.27 per share.Salesforce’s quarterly revenues of $7.84 billion climbed 14% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.81 billion. The top line also improved 19% in constant currency (cc).The company has been benefiting from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Thus, the rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions resulted in the better-than-anticipated performance in the fiscal third quarter.Coming to CRM’s business segments, revenues from Subscription and Support (92% of the total revenues) increased 13% from the year-earlier period to $7.23 billion. Professional Services and Other (8% of total sales) revenues climbed 25% to $604 million.Under the Subscription and Support segment, Sales Cloud revenues grew 12% year over year to $1.7 billion. Revenues from Service Cloud, one of the company’s largest and fastest-growing businesses, also improved 12% to $1.9 billion.Story continuesMarketing &amp; Commerce Cloud revenues jumped 12% to $1.1 billion. Salesforce Platform and Other revenues were up 18% to $1.5 billion. Also, revenues from Data increased 13% year over year to $1 billion.Geographically, Salesforce registered revenue growth of 16% in America (68.5% of the total revenues), 14% in the Asia Pacific (9.3%) and 10% in the EMEA (22.2%) on a year-over-year basis.Salesforce’s gross profit came in at $5.75 billion, up 14.5% from the prior-year period. However, the gross margin remained flat at 73%.Salesforce recorded a non-GAAP operating income of $1.78 billion, up 30.9% year over year. Moreover, the non-GAAP operating margin expanded 290 bps to 22.7% due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of total sales. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to 67% from 72% in the year-ago quarter.Salesforce exited the fiscal third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $11.9 billion, down from the $13.5 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter.CRM generated operating cash flow of $313 million and free cash flow of $115 million in the third quarter. In the first nine months of fiscal 2023, the company generated operating and free cash flow of $4.32 billion and $3.75 billion, respectively.As of Oct 31, 2022, the current remaining performance obligation reflecting revenues under contract for the next 12 months was $20.9 billion, up 11% on a year-over-year basis. In the third quarter, the company bought back shares worth $1.7 billion.Guidance UpdateSalesforce provided fourth-quarter guidance and updated the outlook for fiscal 2023. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Salesforce projects total sales between $7.932 billion and $8.032 billion (midpoint $7.982 billion).The revenue guidance includes a $250-million negative impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates. Furthermore, CRM anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share in the band of $1.35-$1.37 for the current quarter.For fiscal 2023, Salesforce reiterated its revenue guidance range of $30.9-$31 billion. The company forecast that the stronger U.S. dollar against other major currencies would have a $900-million negative impact on total revenues.The company increased its non-GAAP earnings guidance to the $4.92-$4.94 per share range from the $4.71-$4.73 band projected earlier. It increased the non-GAAP operating margin forecast for the fiscal year to 20.7% from 20.4%. However, CRM reduced the year-over-year operating cash flow growth projection to approximately 16% from the earlier guidance range of 16-17%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresCurrently, Salesforce.com has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with an A. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Salesforce.com has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerSalesforce.com belongs to the Zacks Computer - Software industry.

PG&amp;E is poised to respond to potential power outages and urges customers to be prepared as well.Pacific Gas and Electric Company logo (PRNewsfoto/Pacific Gas and Electric Company)A series of weather systems is expected to move through PG&amp;E's service area leading into the weekend, with the strongest system hitting early Saturday and lasting through the night. This New Year's Eve storm will deliver strong, gusty winds, moderate to heavy rain and a chance for isolated thunderstorms. Peak wind risk is expected early Saturday morning across the central and southern parts of PG&amp;E's service area, with gusts in the 35-45 MPH range and isolated gusts up to 55 MPH.PG&amp;E is prepared to respond to any issues caused by the adverse weather which could result in trees, limbs and other debris falling into powerlines, damaging equipment, and interrupting electric service. In advance of the storm, PG&amp;E vegetation management crews are working to keep trees away from powerlines during the forecasted wet and windy weather to reduce the risk of outages.PG&amp;E has been preparing for this storm. The company is using its storm outage prediction models that help determine the potential timing, location, and number of power outages. This allows the company to have extra crews on standby to deploy to areas that are hard hit by the storm. PG&amp;E is also prestaging power poles, powerlines, transformers, and other electric equipment at yards throughout our service territory in preparation to restore power to affected areas safely and as quickly as possible.""Since the beginning of December, there have been several storm systems that have impacted PG&amp;E's service area and each time we have been ready. We encourage customers to prepare for the storm now – have an emergency plan in case you lose power and update your contact information on PG&amp;E's website so we can provide you with real-time updates on outages in your neighborhood,"" said Angie Gibson, vice president, PG&amp;E Emergency Preparedness &amp; ResponseStory continuesKeeping Customers Informed Customers can view real-time outage information at PG&amp;E's online outage center and search by a specific address, by city or by county. This site has been updated to include support in 16 languages.Additionally, customers can sign up for outage notifications by text, email, or phone. PG&amp;E will let customers know the cause of an outage, when crews are on their way, the estimated restoration time and when power has been restored.Storm Safety TipsNever touch downed wires: If you see a downed power line, assume it is energized and extremely dangerous. Do not touch or try to move it—and keep children and animals away. Report downed power lines immediately by calling 9-1-1 and then PG&amp;E at 1-800-743-5002.Use generators safely: Customers with standby electric generators should ensure they are properly installed by a licensed electrician in a well-ventilated area. Improperly installed generators pose a significant danger to customers, as well as crews working on powerlines. If using portable generators, be sure they are in a well-ventilated area.Use flashlights, not candles: During a power outage, use battery-operated flashlights and not candles, due to the risk of fire. And keep extra batteries on hand. If you must use candles, please keep them away from drapes, lampshades, animals and small children. Do not leave candles unattended.Have a backup phone: If you have a telephone system that requires electricity to work, such as a cordless phone or answering machine, plan to have a standard telephone or cellular phone ready as a backup. Having a portable charging device helps to keep your cell phone running.Have fresh drinking water and ice: Freeze plastic containers filled with water to make blocks of ice that can be placed in your refrigerator/freezer to prevent food spoilage.Turn off appliances: If you experience an outage, unplug or turn off all electrical appliances to avoid overloading circuits and to prevent fire hazards when power is restored. Simply leave a single lamp on to alert you when power returns.Safely clean up: After the storm has passed, be sure to safely clean up.

But antitrust experts say the FTC faces an uphill battle to convince a judge to block the deal, because of the voluntary concessions offered by Microsoft to allay fears it could dominate the gaming market.(Reporting by Alexandra Alper; editing by Grant McCool)]"

45,9d0a300c-1eb3-37f6-8f4b-b289542a273f,SIG,2022-12-31,5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks to Buy in the New Year,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-low-price-book-stocks-124212452.html,1672404132,STORY,"['SIG', 'PVH', 'UNM', 'AER']","[Value investors have, over the years, preferred price-to-earnings ratio or P/E as a means to identify value stocks. However, in the case of loss-making companies that have a negative price-to-earnings ratio, the price-to-sales or P/S ratio is considered in determining their true value.However, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), though used less often, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with great returns.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. PVH Corp. PVH, Signet Jewelers SIG, Unum Group UNM, Aercap AER and Sterling Infrastructure STRL are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.Story continuesBut there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:PVH Corp. specializes in designing and marketing branded dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear, jeanswear, intimate apparel, swim products, footwear, handbags and related products.PVH Corp. has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company value investors might notice is Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). ADM is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 14.74 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 14.90. Over the past 52 weeks, ADM's Forward P/E has been as high as 116.19 and as low as 11.67, with a median of 14.50.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. ADM has a P/S ratio of 0.52. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.86.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Archer Daniels Midland's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now.

With the continued fear of the impact of Federal Reserve's aggressively raising interest rate policy, global investors are panicking about getting into the market right now.All major stock indices are in negative territory year to date. The Dow Industrial, Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 have plunged 8.6%, 33% and 19.2%, respectively, in the year to date. In such a scenario, top-ranked stocks like Synopsys can boost one's portfolio. Synopsys, Inc. Price and ConsensusSynopsys, Inc. Price and ConsensusSynopsys, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Synopsys, Inc. QuoteWhy SNPS is an Attractive PickAn Outperformer: A glimpse at SNPS’s price trend reveals that the stock has gained 6.9% in the past six months against 7.3% loss of the Zacks Computer – Software industry. Year to date, shares of the company plunged 12.6%, outperforming the industry’s decline of 31.3%.Trading Way Below 52-Week High: Synopsys stock currently trades lower than its 52-week high, which reflects its potential to go upward. The stock’s closing price of $321.98 on Dec 29 was 17.7% lower than the 52-week high of $391.17 attained on Aug 15, 2022.Attractive Valuation: SNPS currently trades at an attractive valuation multiple. The stock trades at one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of 30.85X compared with its five-year average of 42.96X.Solid Rank &amp; Growth Score: Synopsys currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best investment opportunities to investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.Northward Estimate Revisions: The direction of estimate revisions serves a key role when it comes to the price of a stock. Analysts have raised the estimates for Synopsys’ fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 over the past 30 days, reflecting their confidence in the company. Over the past 30 days, consensus mark for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 earnings moved north by 9 cents and 59 cents, respectively.Story continuesPositive Earnings Surprise History: Synopsys has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 3.4%.Strong Growth Prospects: The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.13 per share for fiscal 2023 earnings suggests growth of 13.8% from the year-ago earnings of $8.90 per share. For fiscal 2024, earnings are expected to increase 18.6% year over year and are likely to reach $12.01 per share.Robust Fundamental Growth Drivers: Synopsys has been benefiting from strong design wins owing to a robust product portfolio. The company’s penetration into new and growing artificial intelligence (AI) chip companies is a major growth driver. With the increasing need for enhanced security measures, considering the rising security threats in interconnected systems laden with software, demand for Synopsys’ solutions is shooting up. Robust growth in software-based verification at both traditional semiconductor and emerging system companies focused on their own in-house design is an upside.Growth in the work-and-learn-from-home trend is driving demand for bandwidth. Synopsys Fusion Design Platform, launched a year ago, is witnessing high demand, helping it generate strong results. Growing demand for advanced technology, design, intellectual property and security solutions is also creating solid prospects. The company’s Verification Continuum platform steadily witnesses excellent demand and competitive wins. Further, ZeBu Server 4 product is generating broad-based adoption by customers’ designing storage, networking and AI chips.Further, strong traction for Fusion Compiler product continues to accelerate Synopsys top line. Rising impact of AI, 5G, internet of things and big data is driving investments in new compute and machine learning architectures. Given the volatile economic scenario at present, customers are strengthening their supplier relationships and focusing on cost efficiencies. Many of them have selected Synopsys as their primary electronic design automation partner.Recently, in October, the company declared that it has produced multiple successful test chip tapeouts on its digital and custom design solutions in collaboration with and certified by Samsung Foundry. This not only strengthened the company’s longstanding collaboration with Samsung Foundry but also addressed the growing customer demand for use of mobile, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence applications by substantially reducing power, improving performance standards and decreasing area levels.Other Key PicksSome top-ranked stocks from the broader Computer and Technology sector are AudioCodes AUDC, Fabrinet FN and Zscaler ZS.

Then the PR nightmare got worse.At Nashville International Airport on Christmas night, a police officer threatened to arrest stranded Southwest passengers if they didn’t leave a secured area of the airport. A video of the incident went viral across social media after being posted by a passenger to TikTok. Other videos spreading on social media also captured parts of the incident.In the video, which has been viewed over 910,000 times since being posted two days ago, the officer warned passengers they must leave the area or they’d be “arrested for trespassing.”“Right now,” he continued. “Everybody to the unsecured side. The ticket counter will help you with any questions you have.”Shelley Morrison, who was among the passengers with her three daughters, had been in line at a Southwest gate hoping to get more information about what was happening with her flight, according to the Tennessean.  After she and others waited for nearly an hour to get clarification, one of the workers announced over the intercom that she was leaving—and calling security. Nobody told the passengers they had to leave if they had a canceled ticket, Morrison told the local paper.'Southwest is calling us'Two police officers from the airport’s public safety department soon arrived on the scene, which is when Morrison’s daughter, Amani Robinson, started recording a video.An officer told passengers in the video, “If you have no ticket, you don't need to be on the secured side.” In response to someone saying they did have tickets, he replied, ""Your tickets just got canceled.”Morrison asked the officer again about potential arrest, to which he reiterated, “If you don’t have a valid ticket and you’re on the secured side and refuse to leave, you will be arrested...If your ticket is canceled, you no longer have a ticket. You understand that, right?”Story continues""Right now, Southwest is calling us because you guys are congregating right here, and they're trying to close that gate,"" he added.The officer grew more impatient as Morrison tried again to “make the legal connection,” as she said in the video, telling him she’s an attorney.“Are you refusing to leave the secured side?” he asked pointedly.“No, I’m not refusing to leave,” she replied. “I’m asking for additional information. Can you cite the statue for me?”“It’s airport and aircraft security,” he replied.“You don’t have a section?” she asked.“I don’t need to give you the code. If you’re an attorney, you can look it up.”Morrison thanked him and proceeded with others to where he indicated.Southwest respondsWhen contacted by Fortune, a Southwest spokesperson said employees ""did not request customers to be escorted out of the gate area."" Instead, the company had asked ""local enforcement to be present at a gate to assist with crowd control efforts while our team worked with customers.""A spokesperson for Nashville International Airport, also known by airport code BNA, responded:""The extraordinary number of flight cancellations over the last week caused great stress for our travelers, and included an unfortunate incident involving a passenger, airline staff, and a BNA officer. We are deeply sorry that this occurred and have taken this situation to heart. We are working with Southwest Airlines, and our other carriers, to foster better communication among team members so that every traveler enjoys the optimal experience at BNA.""Fortune also reached out to the Department of Transportation about the airport incident but received no immediate reply.Southwest passengers who tried to find alternative routes faced jacked-up prices from other airlines, some of which—faced with public backlash—announced price caps on affected routes.The Department of Transportation said this week it will open a probe into Southwest Airlines. It wrote in a tweet that it was “concerned by Southwest’s unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays &amp; reports of lack of prompt customer service. The Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan.”“I am extremely sorry,” Southwest CEO Bob Jordan, who assumed his role in February, told ABC News on Friday following the travel chaos. “There’s just no way to almost apologize enough.”This article has been updated with the responses from Southwest Airlines and the airport.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: People who skipped their COVID vaccine are at higher risk of traffic incidentsElon Musk says getting booed by Dave Chapelle fans 'was a first for me in real life' suggesting he's aware of building backlashGen Z and young millennials have found a new way to afford luxury handbags and watches—living with mom and dadMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand]"

(Dania Maxwell / Los Angeles Times)Southwest Airlines' 2022 nightmare before Christmas is unlikely to inflict long-lasting damage to the carrier’s reputation if management compensates customers and makes good on vows of operational changes, communications and management professionals say.In recent days, social media have been flooded by angry Southwest customers after storms and shaky computer systems forced the airline, the largest domestic carrier in the U.S., to cancel more than 13,000 flights. Chief Executive Bob Jordan has issued multiple apologies while employees work overtime to clean up the mess, which officials in Washington vow to scrutinize.Yet even a meltdown of this magnitude poses little long-term threat to Southwest. The carrier will need to prove it has remedied the technical problems that contributed to the crisis and offer customers generous compensation.The first test for the airline, which didn’t respond to a request for comment, comes Friday as the carrier attempts to resume normal operations.“They’ve gone into the year with a lot of goodwill in the tank,” said Jay Sorensen, a former marketing executive at Midwest Airlines who is now president of IdeaWorksCompany, a consulting firm. “I don’t see long-term damage to Southwest Airlines unless they completely botch the recovery.”Customer-service blunders like Southwest’s spark a harsh public backlash and prompt corporate leaders to promise changes. But the gaffes often are soon forgotten.United Airlines came under withering criticism in 2017 after a 69-year-old passenger getting dragged from a plane was caught in a video that went viral. The company reached a private, out-of-court settlement with the individual.Aside from a lengthy run of bad press and public outcry, “none of that really had much of an impact” on United, said David Austen-Smith, a business professor at Northwestern University whose work includes corporate ethics and crisis management.“The bottom line is when people buy airline tickets they look for price and convenience,"" he said. ""Southwest delivers price and convenience, and for the most part they’re reliable.”Story continuesThat doesn’t mean the airline won’t suffer some fallout. Consumers are likely to book with other carriers into the first quarter of next year, although that will likely moderate in later months, according to Savanthi Syth, an analyst with Raymond James Financial Inc. who recommends buying the stock.Softness in bookings may last “until the half life of the anger is over and people are making spring-break plans,” said Andrew Davis, a former transportation analyst with T. Rowe Price Group Inc., which is a long-term airline investor and currently Southwest’s fourth-largest shareholder.“This time next year, just as many people who were going to fly on Southwest will again,” he said.Shares of Southwest began rebounding Thursday but were still down more than 9% for the week. Analysts have estimated the crisis may cut fourth-quarter profit by up to 5%.Working in the industry’s favor is a paucity of alternatives to long-distance travel in the U.S. That makes it harder for customers to shun a carrier over shoddy service.“That’s given the industry a certain level of confidence that they can get away with more than other industries, and they’re right,” said Eric Dezenhall, chief executive of crisis-management advisory Dezenhall Resources.Internally, such a crisis can be all-consuming for a company. And although industry watchers say the incident is unlikely to put Southwest’s leaders in jeopardy, it will fuel plenty of scrutiny.“The board’s going to worry. The board has to worry,” said Davia Temin, founder of New York-based crisis consultancy Temin &amp; Co. “The board is responsible for making sure that reputation is as good as it can be and that there are crisis management plans even for the unthinkable.”Corporate meltdowns that capture the public’s attention often fuel speculation about a company’s possible demise, Dezenhall said. But that rarely happens without clear wrongdoing by an individual.“People tend to move on once they’re made whole in some way,” he said. “They’re still angry, but they got some goodies out of it.”Southwest has pledged to honor “reasonable requests” for reimbursement from customers who incurred lodging, meal and alternate transportation costs after their flights were delayed or canceled.Davis, now a senior vice president of strategy and investment at Cox Enterprises, said the airline will also likely offer customers a generous travel voucher or discount.“A pretty significant one — probably the biggest you’ll ever see,” he said.Starbucks Corp. touched off a fiery controversy over race after a 2018 incident in which two Black men were arrested at a Philadelphia store after one asked to use the restroom without placing an order while waiting for another guest to arrive.Video of the incident spread widely online and the hashtag #BoycottStarbucks trended on Twitter. After an apology from then-CEO Kevin Johnson, the coffee chain closed more than 8,000 stores for anti-bias training and set a policy that its restrooms would be open to all. It has also made corporate diversity data public and released details about its inclusion initiatives.Jordan, Southwest’s CEO, has already taken steps to rebuild the public’s trust. In addition to his apologies, he’s told employees, “I’m accountable for this,” and vowed to “double down” on plans to upgrade the systems that were overwhelmed.“It isn’t enough for even a well-meaning CEO to give his word,” Temin said. “It has to start a real series of events and change.”This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

The airline’s dated technology failed to map crews to flights and its point-to-point operational structure created chaos for schedules, the company has admitted and union members have said.Southwest Airlines has promised to reimburse passengers for expenses such as hotels and car rentals in addition to refunding tickets and said there would be a still-undetermined hit to its earnings.Story continuesTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in a letter to Jordan on Thursday warned that the company would be held accountable if it did not fulfill commitments to customers for “controllable delays and cancellations.”The Southwest chief executive said he had a “great conversation” with Buttigieg and their goals were aligned.(Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Mark Porter) ]"

If you want to read about similar stocks, you can go to 5 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley's Quant Screen.Morgan Stanley has been raising alarms about an ""earnings recession"" throughout 2022. We did a piece on Morgan Stanley's dividend stock picks back in September. At the time of that writing, Morgan Stanley's base case was the S&amp;P 500 plunging to 3,400 by the end of 2022 and the major bank's bear case was the S&amp;P 500 ending the year at 3,000. We are now at the end of the year and, as of December 28, the S&amp;P 500 sits well-above 3,800 points. However, the CIO of Morgan Stanley, Mike Wilson, maintains his relatively pessimistic outlook on the markets heading into 2023.""It's a Stock Picking Game""On December 15, Mike Wilson appeared in an interview on CNBC, where he discussed his outlook for the markets going into 2023. Mike Wilson noted that the Federal Reserve and inflation are old news and the markets have already priced that in. However, a slowdown in growth is not yet priced in by the markets which is ultimately going ""to determine the winners"". Here are some comments from the CIO of Morgan Stanley, Mike Wilson:""In October, the downtick in CPI was a surprise. We got a big rally off of that because rates came in. But to think you are going to get another rally on that news, I think that is a bit naive because you already had it... CPI has peaked, inflation has peaked, we are pretty confident that it is going to come down pretty hard next year, and the real question is, what does that mean about growth. And that is the second part of our bear market story that we have been talking about for almost twelve months now, that the growth slowdown is not yet priced. And that's what's going to determine the winners, like it's a stock picking game. There are going to be some companies that are going to deliver on that, but at the index level, we are pretty pessimistic that we can support these prices given our outlook on earnings next year...""Story continuesMike Wilson noted that Morgan Stanley is looking for a 15% to 20% earnings miss, well below or roughly 16% below Wall Street consensus, however the ""good news"" is that a majority of investors are on board. Mike Wilson said:""people assume earnings are going to come down, but it's the magnitude of that decline and how fast that's going to come down, we think that's where the surprise is. The negative operating levels that we see, from falling inflation by the way, is what's going to hurt margins, and that's irrespective of whether we have an economic recession.""Mike Wilson said that ""some companies are already in an earnings recession"" and that ""every quarter has been disappointing"", however, ""we haven't gotten any guidance on 2023, because companies have no reason to talk about 2023 until we get there"". When companies disclose their fourth quarter earnings, Mike Wilson expects that time to ""create the final plunge on multiples that can give us a real buying opportunity"". Mike Wilson finally noted that:""The bear market has been driven by Fed policy, higher rates, concerns about inflation, multiples have contracted. So we got relief on that, and that's why we rallied. But that's a trade because ultimately, stocks will care about the earnings decline as much as they care about the Fed pausing or even continuing for another couple of months.""According to Mike Wilson, ""it's a stock picking game"" and when companies report their fourth-quarter 2022 earnings, investors can get ""a real buying opportunity"".

(NYSE:VST) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We had a hard time deciding which company we should discuss in this letter. By just about every metric, all our holdings are cheap from both a relative and absolute perspective – especially compared to the performance of commodity prices and the recent pullback in the overall complex of energy stocks. For the first six months of 2022, oil was up 41%, natural gas up 45%, natural gas liquids up 34%, and the futures curve for electricity (in the two biggest deregulated power markets) is up ~30%, but our holdings were only up a measly ~1% by mid-year! The point is all our positions are investment stories worth telling.However, Vistra Corp stands out among the names we own. First, the market environment has improved materially over a multi-year basis, which will enhance VST’s ability to mint cash and at the same time underscores the longevity of VST’s asset base. Second, VST’s market value has remained flat, despite shrinking the share count by nearly 15% since adopting a transformational capital allocation strategy. The combination of those two factors results in ~50% more value in a VST share today than just six months ago.The bottom line is that the discount to intrinsic value of VST’s equity has become more attractive than ever. To better understand the two broader points, as well as our heightened conviction, it’s worth providing a brief history of the IPPs and summarizing the original VST investment thesis…” (Click here to see the full text)Some of the best-performing dividend stocks to buy according to Morgan Stanley's quant screen include Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), AbbVie Inc.

Strength across its segments, shareholder-friendly activities and benefits from acquisitions primarily drove the stock. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Roper’s Application Software segment is benefiting from strength across its Deltek, Vertafore, Aderant, CliniSys and Data Innovations businesses. The segment’s growth is supported by strength in its recurring revenue stream, led by strong customer retention and continued migration to SaaS delivery models. For the fourth quarter of 2022, the company expects organic growth of 6-8% for the segment.The Network Software segment is benefiting from the strong performance of the United States and Canada freight matching businesses. Strength across the Foundry business, owing to solid innovation capability, is driving the segment’s performance. Solid customer additions are aiding the iTradeNetwork business within the Network Software segment. For the fourth quarter, the company expects organic growth of 8-10%.With record orders and backlog levels, Roper’s Neptune business is fueling growth of the Technology Enabled Products segment. Strong ordering activity in the medical product business, including Verathon and Northern Digital, is a key growth driver for the segment. For the fourth quarter, the company expects organic growth of 5-7% for the segment.Roper’s measures to expand its operations through successive acquisitions are driving its growth. In October 2022, the company acquired Frontline Education for $3.7 billion. The acquisition builds on Roper’s Horizon software business (which it acquired in 2008), expanding its presence in the K-12 education market. The acquisition is expected to contribute approximately $370 million to Roper’s revenues and $175 million to its EBITDA in 2023.ROP raised its full-year outlook to include the benefits of this acquisition. For 2022, the company expects adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $14.09-$14.13 (previous view: $13.46-$13.62). Organic growth from continuing operations is expected to be 9% in 2022.Apart from the Frontline buyout, Roper acquired American LegalNet in January 2022, which strengthened its Aderant business. Acquisitions/divestitures boosted sales by 1% in the third quarter. In 2020, the company made several acquisitions, including Team TSI Corporation, Freight Market Intelligence Consortium, WELIS, Impact Financial Systems, Vertafore and EPSi.Strong cash flow generation capacity supports Roper’s shareholder-friendly activities.

(NYSE:GS) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe President &amp; COO, John Waldron, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.2m worth of shares at a price of US$387 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$343. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Goldman Sachs Group insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

Specifically, insiders ditched US$12m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs GroupLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Goldman Sachs Group insiders own about US$510m worth of shares (which is 0.4% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought Goldman Sachs Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Biggest Stocks that Benefit from Rising Interest Rates.The US Federal Reserve has increased the benchmark interest rates to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% in December 2022. This is the highest benchmark interest rate since December 2007. The move has been made to combat raging inflation that reached a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022 and recorded an increase of 7.1% YoY in November 2022. The Federal Reserve has warned of further interest rate hikes in 2023 and has provided a median benchmark interest rate guidance of 5.1% for the next year. The increase in the benchmark interest rates is expected to tighten the economy and bring inflation back to the Federal Reserve’s long-term target of 2%.The developments related to interest rate changes require close attention from investors. In circumstances where interest rates are on the rise and the economy is showing signs of improvement, numerous opportunities rise in the world of equities. According to a top adviser to the president, the White House is confident that the US economy can still achieve a “soft landing” as the significant public investments made by Joe Biden will provide support to the job market in the coming months. Despite the Fed Reserve’s monetary tightening in full force over the previous three months, the US labor market outperformed expectations and posted an average monthly job increase of 272,000.Certain businesses, such as those belonging to the financial sector, are likely to experience a tailwind as an increase in interest rates results in higher profit margins. Meanwhile, brokerage institutions start to experience an increase in trading activity as the economy starts to recover and also experience higher interest income due to surging interest rates. However, this does not mean that investors should remain restricted to the financial sector only. Retailers and consumer companies also experience positive momentum as the economy starts to recover. Companies such as  JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) are amongst some of the biggest stocks that stand to benefit from rising interest rates.Story continues12 Biggest Stocks that Benefit from Rising Interest RatesPhoto by Nicholas Cappello on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have analyzed the business models of numerous companies to assess the impact of the rising interest rates on their financial strength and growth plans. According to experts, the majority of the companies that are expected to benefit from rising interest rates belong to the financial sector. The financial sector companies shortlisted have a strong global presence and offer expansive wealth management and investment banking services. Rising interest rates are expected to boost their profit margins in the coming quarters. Furthermore, we have also included some leading names from the consumer goods and home improvement retail sector. These stocks have been ranked according to the hedge fund sentiment as of Q3 2022.12 Biggest Stocks that Benefit from Rising Interest Rates12. Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) is a Cottonwood Heights, Utah-based real estate investment trust (REIT) founded in 1977 that is focused on investing in self-storage units.Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) carries a significant amount of debt as it buys self-storage properties on mortgages. However, around 62% of the company’s total debt is on a fixed interest rate of 3.2% only as of Q3 2022. This will play in favor of Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) during a period of rising interest rates, as the company will observe significant savings on financing costs. In a research report released on December 5, Ki Bin Kim at Truist assigned Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) stock a target price of $175 and reiterated a Buy rating following the Q3 2022 results and the recent developments taking place in the self-storage REIT industry.Baron Funds shared its stance on Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Following a sharp correction in its share price during the second quarter, we acquired shares in Extra Space Storage Inc. This REIT has assembled the second-largest self-storage portfolio in the country and has the largest portfolio of third-party managed self-storage facilities. In our opinion, Extra Space’s management team is excellent. Over the last decade, management has delivered strong occupancy gains, rent growth, and expense control that has led to a cost of capital advantage relative to its peers. Management has capitalized on its cost of capital advantage by tripling its owned self-storage count since 2010. We believe the long-term growth opportunity for the company remains strong.”11. Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS) is a Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based operator of departmental store chains across the US. The company, founded in 1962, is present in every US state except Hawaii through its 1,165 locations network.Like other departmental store operators, Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS) is also in the business of issuing its own branded retail store card that can be used only at Kohl’s stores and Kohls.com. During periods of rising interest rates, the company is expected to generate more income through its store credit cards as the annual percentage rate (APR) would rise in line with the increasing benchmark interest rates. In addition to having a positive brand reputation within its target market, Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS) also offers excellent cash flow generation capabilities in a more stable market, unexplored options for capital allocation, and the possibility of agreements with new brand partners in the coming quarters.As of Q3 2022, Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS) was held by 31 hedge funds.10. The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37 The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) is a New York-based insurance company that has the distinction of being the second biggest underwriter of US commercial property and casualty insurance.The company, founded in 1853, is the sixth-biggest underwriter in the field of personal insurance through its vast network of independent agents. The relationship between rising benchmark interest rates and the growth of insurance companies is positive as portfolio yields increase in tandem with appropriate rate increases. Insurance companies also make significant investments in bonds as they keep funds parked to back the insurance policies issued by them. Despite the significant weakness in the performance of the broader market, The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) stock has observed an increase of over 21% since the start of 2022.Millennium Management increased its stake in The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) by 100% during Q3 2022.9. Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) is a financial services firm founded in 1985 that operates Discover Bank and provides payment services solutions globally.At the conclusion of the third quarter, Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) credit card loans totaled $83.6 billion, up 19% from the previous quarter. Furthermore, private student loans climbed by $165 million and personal loans by $784 million, respectively, year over year. Excluding acquired loans, the organic student loan portfolio also saw a rise of 4% from the same time last year. These were positive developments for Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), considering the rising interest rates. An expansion of the net interest margin and higher average receivables were the primary drivers of the quarter’s 18% growth in net interest income.As of Q3 2022, Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) was held by 40 hedge funds.8. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) is a Findlay, Ohio-based refining, marketing, and transportation provider of petroleum products.The company is expected to save significantly during the rising interest rate environment due to its low debt levels. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) has been lowering its debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio since March 2020. Experts anticipate Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) to have a strong 2023 as the refining market is expected to remain under pressure due to supply-related limitations that would support a high-margin environment like 2022. For the recently ended quarter, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) increased its dividend by about 30%. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) strives to have each of its assets produce free cash flow for the company and increase returns to shareholders.As of Q3 2022, Paul Singer’s Elliot Management was the biggest hedge fund holder of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) stock, with a stake of over $1 billion.Here’s what Clark Street Value said about Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“During the worst of covid, I bought some LEAPs on Marathon Petroleum (MPC) as a proxy for Par Pacific (PARR) since long dated options weren’t available on the later.  Those MPC calls expire next month and I’ll take profits, with PARR I’ve reduced my position throughout the year and might sell the rest early next year, I’ve owned it for 6-7 years and it has gone nowhere, they haven’t touched the NOLs, just a difficult business that I probably don’t understand as well as I should.”7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an Issaquah, Washington-based operator of membership-only big-box retail stores.The strong membership model operated by the company is insulated from the volatility in the discretionary retail sector due to rising interest rates and inflation. There are strong expectations that increasing interest rates and high inflation will increase membership rates as consumers look to benefit from discounts. Furthermore, numerous members are now becoming executive members, who must pay a double membership fee in exchange for an extra 2% discount while shopping at Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST).On December 21, Ivan Feinseth at Tigress Financial gave Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock a target price of $635, along with a Buy rating. The analyst highlighted the recent dip in the stock price as an attractive buying opportunity for investors.Here’s what Cooper Investors said about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”6. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a New York-based investment bank and a diversified financial services company.The company is preparing itself to benefit from a rising interest rate environment by broadening its partnership with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Unlike other banks, Goldman Sachs has agreed to provide customers the option to view their deposit account balances on their digital wallets. Furthermore, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is working with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to develop high-yielding savings account along with a buy now pay later (BNPL) plan that would be exclusively available to customers of Apple. This reflects The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (NYSE:GS) intention to provide consumer banking services through the digital medium without opting for full-fledged physical operations.ClearBridge Investments discussed its stance on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We also initiated a new position in The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), which is trading far below what we would expect of a well-capitalized financials stock capable of generating an attractive return on equity over a market cycle. The company’s prospects are further enhanced by strong market share gains and further buildout of its fintech consumer finance initiatives.Additionally, its earnings appear to have stabilized from the peak deal activity and inflated asset valuations of the last market cycle. While we acknowledge that a full-blown recession would put pressure on these earnings, Goldman Sachs has a history of capitalizing on downcycles to solidify its leading investment and trading businesses.”In addition to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and The Home Depot, Inc.

65,ae6894d1-95f3-3e9d-9304-d1164b57e4e6,NFLX,2022-12-31,Returns On Capital Are Showing Encouraging Signs At Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-showing-encouraging-signs-120109232.html,1672488069,STORY,['NFLX'],"[If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So on that note, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Netflix is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$5.7b ÷ (US$48b - US$7.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Netflix has an ROCE of 14%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 8.4% generated by the Entertainment industry. See our latest analysis for Netflix roceIn the above chart we have measured Netflix's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Netflix.So How Is Netflix's ROCE Trending?We like the trends that we're seeing from Netflix. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 14%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 242% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Netflix thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.One more thing to note, Netflix has decreased current liabilities to 16% of total assets over this period, which effectively reduces the amount of funding from suppliers or short-term creditors. This tells us that Netflix has grown its returns without a reliance on increasing their current liabilities, which we're very happy with.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn summary, it's great to see that Netflix can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And with a respectable 40% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Netflix can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.On the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation. That's why we have a FREE intrinsic value estimation on our platform  that is definitely worth checking out.While Netflix isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Phillips 66 (PSX). PSX is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A.We also note that PSX holds a PEG ratio of 0.42. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PSX's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.51. PSX's PEG has been as high as 1.06 and as low as 0.37, with a median of 0.63, all within the past year.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PSX's P/B ratio of 1.45. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.07. PSX's P/B has been as high as 2.40 and as low as 1.15, with a median of 1.69, over the past year.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. PSX has a P/S ratio of 0.29. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.3.Story continuesFinally, investors will want to recognize that PSX has a P/CF ratio of 4.08. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 4.59. Over the past year, PSX's P/CF has been as high as 33.65 and as low as 3.23, with a median of 8.85.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Phillips 66's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment.

(NYSE:TJX). The company's stock led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at TJX Companies’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies What's The Opportunity In TJX Companies?According to my valuation model, TJX Companies seems to be fairly priced at around 16.27% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy TJX Companies today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $68.46, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. In addition to this, TJX Companies has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.What kind of growth will TJX Companies generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. TJX Companies' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 40%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in TJX’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TJX, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell raised interest rates for the seventh time this year, taking the benchmark rate to the range of 3.75% and 4.00% — the highest level since 2008. The increase in interest rates has made borrowing expensive, pushed up the cost of buying a new car or house, increased the cost of carrying credit card debt and thus heightened the risk of a recession.However, the latest bouts of data, including easing consumer prices, rising consumer confidence, a solid job report, and strong manufacturing activity, suggest that a large part of the economy remains resilient.

Battery metal lead, sustained by tight supplies, low inventories and inclusion in a commodity index from January, has fared better, dropping only 15% since March.Spiralling inflation, COVID lockdowns in top consumer China and aggressive interest rate rises are behind economic weakness and dwindling demand growth for industrial metals such as copper, used in the power and construction industries.""The macro picture in 2023 rhymes with 2022 and many of the crises that developed this year will reverberate into the next,"" Bank of America analysts said in a note.However, BoA noted that metals prices had already fallen significantly and that they would outperform energy in the first half of next year.The knee-jerk reaction to China's recent easing of COVID controls was to drive up prices of metals such as aluminium, used in transport, packaging and construction, but a surge in infections has prompted a rethink.Higher U.S. interest rates mean a stronger U.S. currency; a double whammy for dollar-priced copper, which was trading at $8,450 a tonne at 1210 GMT, and aluminium at $2,420, zinc at $3,000, lead at $2,290, tin at $25,350 and nickel at $30,530.""We expect copper to fall to $7,800 a tonne over the next three months as an end to finished goods restocking, higher smelter output, seasonal weakness, and weakness in global end-use consumption drives the market into surplus,"" Citi analysts said in a note.The picture for nickel is clouded by March's trading fiasco on the London Metal Exchange, which created a confidence crisis in the contract leading to sliding volumes and liquidity.Story continues""While these conditions persist, we can expect continued episodes of elevated nickel price volatility, although we think our bearish fundamental view will ultimately win out,"" Citi said.Used mainly to make stainless steel, nickel is now also a key material for electric vehicle batteries.For soldering material tin, a major theme is consumer belt tightening, which has hit demand for electronic goods.""Slowing (tin) demand is perhaps best illustrated by global semiconductor billings, which had retraced 18% by September, since reaching an all-time high in February,"" Macquarie analysts said in a note.(Reporting by Pratima Desai; editing by Kirsten Donovan)]"

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to General Dynamics'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Dynamics is:19% = US$3.4b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.19 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.General Dynamics' Earnings Growth And 19% ROETo begin with, General Dynamics seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 10%. Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why General Dynamics saw little to no growth in the past five years. Therefore, there could be some other aspects that could potentially be preventing the company from growing. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared General Dynamics' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 5.5% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for GD? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is General Dynamics Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Despite having a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 40% (meaning the company retains60% of profits) in the last three-year period, General Dynamics' earnings growth was more or les flat. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.Additionally, General Dynamics has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 39% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 21%.ConclusionOverall, we feel that General Dynamics certainly does have some positive factors to consider. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

(NYSE:NEE). This is encouraging because it indicates that insiders are more optimistic about the company's prospects.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for NextEra Energy The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At NextEra EnergyOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by insider James Robo for US$5.0m worth of shares, at about US$77.26 per share. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$83.60 per share to be enticing. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices.NextEra Energy insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of NextEra EnergyFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. NextEra Energy insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$265m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At NextEra Energy Tell Us?The fact that there have been no NextEra Energy insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like NextEra Energy insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs (1 is concerning!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in NextEra Energy.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Battery metal lead, sustained by tight supplies, low inventories and inclusion in a commodity index from January, has fared better, dropping only 15% since March.Spiralling inflation, COVID lockdowns in top consumer China and aggressive interest rate rises are behind economic weakness and dwindling demand growth for industrial metals such as copper, used in the power and construction industries.""The macro picture in 2023 rhymes with 2022 and many of the crises that developed this year will reverberate into the next,"" Bank of America analysts said in a note.However, BoA noted that metals prices had already fallen significantly and that they would outperform energy in the first half of next year.The knee-jerk reaction to China's recent easing of COVID controls was to drive up prices of metals such as aluminium, used in transport, packaging and construction, but a surge in infections has prompted a rethink.Higher U.S. interest rates mean a stronger U.S. currency; a double whammy for dollar-priced copper, which was trading at $8,450 a tonne at 1210 GMT, and aluminium at $2,420, zinc at $3,000, lead at $2,290, tin at $25,350 and nickel at $30,530.""We expect copper to fall to $7,800 a tonne over the next three months as an end to finished goods restocking, higher smelter output, seasonal weakness, and weakness in global end-use consumption drives the market into surplus,"" Citi analysts said in a note.The picture for nickel is clouded by March's trading fiasco on the London Metal Exchange, which created a confidence crisis in the contract leading to sliding volumes and liquidity.Story continues""While these conditions persist, we can expect continued episodes of elevated nickel price volatility, although we think our bearish fundamental view will ultimately win out,"" Citi said.Used mainly to make stainless steel, nickel is now also a key material for electric vehicle batteries.For soldering material tin, a major theme is consumer belt tightening, which has hit demand for electronic goods.""Slowing (tin) demand is perhaps best illustrated by global semiconductor billings, which had retraced 18% by September, since reaching an all-time high in February,"" Macquarie analysts said in a note.(Reporting by Pratima Desai; editing by Kirsten Donovan)]"

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM QUALCOMM Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, James Cathey, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$232k worth of shares at a price of US$145 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$110. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price. The only individual insider seller over the last year was James Cathey.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Does QUALCOMM Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that QUALCOMM insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$158m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The QUALCOMM Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the QUALCOMM insiders selling. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for QUALCOMM (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.Story continuesIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Some investors may consider buying large capitalization stocks because they are seen as a safer investment with a lower level of risk compared to smaller or newer companies.All in all, 2022 has been a rather bad year for investors. Inflation and interest rates have been the two main market drivers that have weighed on stocks throughout 2022. In 2022 alone, investors in the mutual funds invested in US equities lost about 19% on average. The FED’s monetary tightening has weighed on equity valuations, and the central bank has shown no sign of pivot as of yet.Although the outlook may appear grim, there is some respite for long-term investors in that this may be an excellent time to buy equities. The stock market as a whole has recovered from every previous bear market in history and gone on to establish new all-time highs. The good thing about a bear market is that investors get to pick solid companies at cheap valuations, which is a luxury they don’t get in bull cycles.

This decline in demand is part of a larger trend affecting consumer-facing businesses, which have seen a drop in demand following the pandemic.In response to this decline, Qualcomm is attempting to reduce operating costs and focus on expanding into new areas, such as the automotive industry.QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and ConsensusQUALCOMM Incorporated Price and ConsensusQUALCOMM Incorporated price-consensus-chart | QUALCOMM Incorporated QuoteThe company’s CEO, Mr. Palkhiwala, is wary of the firm’s outlook for 2023 owing to rising global uncertainty, including a challenging macroeconomic environment, political and economic conditions in different regions, and the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, there is currently a high inventory in the semiconductor industry, which adds to uncertainty in the short term.The company is taking several steps to address the challenges it is facing. One of these steps is redirecting resources and spending toward areas of the business where there is potential for growth, such as the automotive and Internet of Things sectors.Additionally, Qualcomm is making selective headcount reductions in certain areas and preparing contingency plans in case further action is needed. These measures are likely being taken to respond to uncertainty and challenges in the market and position the company for success in the future.Also, the company issued new debt in 2022 to replace aging bonds nearing maturity. The company had locked in rates a couple of years ago, which helped to protect against the recent increase in interest rates. While the coupon on the debt may show a higher rate, it can take advantage of the rate locks that were put in place earlier, per the company’s report.Story continuesQualcomm manufactures and markets digital wireless telecom products and services based on the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology. The products include CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications as well as global positioning system products.The company faces huge concentration risks as the bulk of its revenues is generated from a handful of customers — a trend that is expected to continue in the ensuing quarter. Moreover, Qualcomm has been facing challenges from low-cost chip manufacturers like MediaTek and Rockchip as well as handset manufacturers' SoC projects such as Exynos by Samsung.At present, QCOM carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Lockheed Martin's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Lockheed Martin is:49% = US$5.9b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.49 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Lockheed Martin's Earnings Growth And 49% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Lockheed Martin has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 10% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 14% net income growth seen by Lockheed Martin over the past five years. growthStory continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Lockheed Martin's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 5.5% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is LMT fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Lockheed Martin Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Lockheed Martin has a three-year median payout ratio of 42%, which implies that it retains the remaining 58% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Besides, Lockheed Martin has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 48%. However, Lockheed Martin's ROE is predicted to rise to 131% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Lockheed Martin's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Lockheed Martin (LMT) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $7.42 a share 25 days away from its upcoming earnings release on January 24, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $7.42 Most Accurate Estimate and the $7.40 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Lockheed Martin has an Earnings ESP of 0.23%.LMT is just one of a large group of Aerospace stocks with a positive ESP figure. Boeing (BA) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on January 25, 2023, Boeing holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.75 a share 26 days from its next quarterly update.For Boeing, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.39 is 91.76%.Story continuesLMT and BA's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

LMT recently secured a modification contract involving the MH-60R aircraft. The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $43.4 million, the contract is projected to get completed by May 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will be engaged in the production and delivery of one MH-60R aircraft.The company will also procure one unique modification kit for modifying the MH-60R aircraft from a standard Foreign Military Sales configuration to a unique configuration for the Commonwealth of Australia. The majority of the work related to this deal will be executed in Owego, NY.Significance of MH-60R AircraftThe MH-60R Seahawk is the world’s most advanced maritime helicopter designed to operate from frigates, destroyers, cruisers and aircraft carriers. It is equipped for a range of missions, including anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, search and rescue, naval gunfire support, surveillance, logistics support, personnel transfer and vertical replenishment.Currently, it is operational and deployed with the U.S. Navy as the primary anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface weapon system for open ocean and littoral zones.Growth ProspectsThe United States, the largest exporter of military weaponry worldwide, is strengthening military resources. This is quite evident from the fiscal 2023 budget proposal worth $773 billion put forward by the Biden administration for the Department of Defense, with $56.5 billion planned investments in combat aircraft. Impressively, the defense budget request reflects a 4.1% increase from the fiscal 2022 enacted amount.Such solid budgetary provisions should benefit Lockheed and defense manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Boeing BA and Textron TXT, which also have expertise in manufacturing military aircraft.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems. It also enables warfighters to accomplish missions under any condition.Story continuesNOC stock boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.3%.

107,681b288a-d3c7-3277-ae74-df134790b7a4,PHM,2022-12-31,"PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-inc-phm-attracting-investor-140002763.html,1672408802,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this homebuilder have returned +1.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.6% change. The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, to which PulteGroup belongs, has gained 4.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.90 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.14 points to a change of +38.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.05 indicates a change of -30.5% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PulteGroup is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $4.6 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.6%. The $15.66 billion and $14.53 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12.5% and -7.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.4%. EPS of $2.69 for the same period compares with $1.82 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.49%. The EPS surprise was -1.47%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today’s Research Daily features an update on the evolving earnings picture for 2023 and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) and CSX Corporation (CSX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Earnings Outlook for 2023Multiple forces are at play in driving stock prices at any point in time. But the two biggest forces in the long run are interest rates and corporate earnings, with our focus in this note solely on the earnings part.Aggregate bottom-up earnings for the S&amp;P 500 index are currently expected to be up +2.2% in 2023 on +2.1% higher revenues. This would follow the +4.7% earnings growth in 2022 on +10.6% higher revenues.Estimates for 2023 have been steadily coming down, after peaking in mid-April 2022. In the aggregate, S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates have declined by -9.4% since mid-April for the index as a whole and -11.8% excluding the Energy sector.Estimates have been cut for 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest cuts to estimates for the Construction (Negative revision of -29.6% since mid-April), Consumer Discretionary (-21.5%), Retail (-21.2%), Tech (-19.6%), Industrials (-13.8%), Aerospace (-13.7%), and Transportation (-10.2%). Estimates for Energy, Utilities, Autos and Basic Materials have modestly increased.The future course of revisions will depend on how the underlying economic outlook unfolds in response to the Fed tightening cycle.I am of the opinion that a relatively a benign outcome for the U.S. economy where it is able to dodge a nasty recession will be consistent with an earnings outlook that is roughly in-line with current earnings estimates.I am not suggesting that estimates do not need to come down further. But rather that with aggregate estimates outside of the Energy sector already down by almost -12% since mid-April, there may not be a whole lot of further room to fall as long as the economic outlook doesn't materially deteriorate.Story continuesToday's Featured Research ReportsShares of Apple have declined -27.9% over the past year against the Zacks Tech sector's decline of -37.3% and the S&amp;P 500 index's -20.9% pullback. The Zacks analyst believes that Apple’s holiday season iPhone shipments are expected to suffer from disruptions at its Chinese partner Foxconn’s factory in Zhengzhou. We expect Apple to ship roughly 70 million iPhones in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.The company expects year-over-year revenue growth to decelerate in the fiscal first quarter compared with the fiscal fourth quarter due to unfavorable forex. Mac revenues are expected to be negatively impacted by forex. Apple expects Mac revenues to decline substantially year over year during the December quarter.Services revenue growth is expected to be negatively impacted by challenging macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable forex, as well as weakness in digital advertising and gaming. Nevertheless, a growing subscriber base in the Services business and a strong liquidity position are key catalysts.(You can read the full research report on Apple here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson have gained +3.1% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +12.3%. The Zacks analyst believes that J&amp;J’s sales in the MedTech unit are recovering and the company is focusing on growing this business through new products. J&amp;J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions.However, macroeconomic headwinds like inflationary pressure, rising input costs and negative currency impact are hurting margins. Headwinds like generic competition and pricing pressure continue. Stelara’s upcoming loss of exclusivity in 2023 is a concern. Though J&amp;J has taken meaningful steps to resolve its talc and opioid litigation, they continue to remain an overhang on the stock.(You can read the full research report on Johnson &amp; Johnson here &gt;&gt;&gt;)CSX shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past six months (+6.5% vs. +3.5%). The Zacks analyst believes that CSX is benefiting from higher export coal volumes, domestic intermodal shipments and favorable pricing. With the demand scenario expected to remain strong, despite the current market bloodbath, management anticipates double-digit growth in operating income and revenues for 2022 from 2021's reported levels.However, supply-chain disturbances are hurting CSX's operations. Weakness in the merchandise segment due to lower volumes of fertilizers is concerning. High costs, primarily due to escalating fuel expenses, pose a threat to CSX’s bottom line. High capital expenditures are also worrisome.(You can read the full research report on CSX here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Halliburton Company (HAL), American International Group, Inc.

Though all three major bourses are in deep red, the Dow Jones fared as the best index, declining 8.6%. The S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 19.2% and 33%, respectively.While less than half of the stocks in the blue-chip index are in green, five have gained in double digits and remain the hottest throughout the year. These include Chevron CVX, Merck &amp; Co. MRK, The Travelers Companies Inc. TRV, Amgen AMGN and Caterpillar CAT.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, aggressive Fed rate hikes and global growth concerns have roiled the stock market badly. Additionally, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China has slowed down economic activities across the country.The Fed has been on an aggressive tightening spree for more than decades. Fed Chair Jerome Powell raised interest rates for the seventh time this year, taking the benchmark rate to the range of 3.75% and 4.00% — the highest level since 2008. The increase in interest rates has made borrowing expensive, pushed up the cost of buying a new car or house, increased the cost of carrying credit card debt and thus heightened the risk of a recession.However, the latest bouts of data, including easing consumer prices, rising consumer confidence, a solid job report, and strong manufacturing activity, suggest that a large part of the economy remains resilient. Oil prices have been rising on tightening supply and higher demand conditions.The outperformance of the blue-chip index came as it has significant exposure to cyclical sectors like energy, industrials and financials. These sectors have performed well this year. Energy is the top sector of 2022 driven by higher oil price, industrials has gained strength on improving manufacturing and industrial activities, while the financial sector got a boost from rate hikes.Best Stocks of DowChevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world, with operations that span almost every corner of the globe.

Markets have been suffering on Fed's indication that interest rates will continue to rise through 2023. This has made investors worried about an impending recession.The Dow, the S&amp;P 500, and the Nasdaq are likely to close the year down 8.6%, 19.2% and 33%, respectively. The multi-year high inflation rate is currently the biggest threat to the U.S. economy. Even though there are recent hints that inflation is slowing down, it is still not under complete control.Multiple Headwinds AheadThe Personal Consumption Index (PCE) data for November, the Fed's favored inflation gauge rose a modest 0.1% in November, less than the consensus estimate. Also, the rate of inflation decreased year over year in November. On a year-over-year basis, inflation increased 4.7% in November after rising 5% in October.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the PCE price index rose 0.2% in November, after climbing 0.3% in the month earlier.This follows the Consumer pricing index (CPI) data for November, which reflected a 7.1% year-over-year rise in inflation, indicating that inflation has slowed substantially from the record highs of 8.2% in September and 8.3% in August. However, it is still at multi-year highs and the Fed has hinted at further rate hikes in 2023.Market participants also feel that the recent PCE data won't have much of an impact on the Fed's plans to continue with its aggressive rate-hike agenda.Investors are now concerned about how long the Fed will continue with its policy of raising interest rates. Until the Fed indicates a reduction in interest rates, investors believe that trading will remain volatile and stocks will be under pressure.Investors are worried that high-interest rates could not only slow down the economy but also push it into a recession, as inflation is still well above the Fed's target of 2%.Story continuesGeopolitical concerns have also been impacting markets. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, which contributed to a wintertime global oil and gas deficit, is causing supply-chain disruptions.Additionally, the surging COVID-19 cases in China, resulting in the deaths of thousands, and the way Beijing is responding to the situation have also been unsettling markets as investors are concerned about how the lifting of COVID-related restrictions in China will impact global markets and economies.Given this situation, it makes sense for an astute investor to keep an eye on dividend-paying stocks at the moment. This is because dividend stocks have the potential to endure market volatility and have a track record of success and a solid business plan.They not only offer a consistent flow of revenues but also minimize the likelihood of frequent price changes. Additionally, during times of market turbulence, dividend-paying stocks have consistently outperformed non-dividend-paying stocks. Four such companies are Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. LW, Sandstorm Gold Ltd. SAND, Graco Inc. GGG and The Mosaic Company MOS.Lamb Weston is an Eagle, ID-based company.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Lockheed Martin (LMT) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $7.42 a share 25 days away from its upcoming earnings release on January 24, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $7.42 Most Accurate Estimate and the $7.40 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Lockheed Martin has an Earnings ESP of 0.23%.LMT is just one of a large group of Aerospace stocks with a positive ESP figure. Boeing (BA) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on January 25, 2023, Boeing holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.75 a share 26 days from its next quarterly update.For Boeing, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.39 is 91.76%.Story continuesLMT and BA's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

ILMN need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $145.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Illumina shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Illumina is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry that ranks in the Top 27% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 87 cents per share to 43 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Illumina right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Cigna Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.18bUS$10.0bUS$8.60bUS$9.01bUS$8.92bUS$8.92bUS$8.97bUS$9.06bUS$9.18bUS$9.32bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ -0.01%Est @ 0.58%Est @ 1.00%Est @ 1.30%Est @ 1.50% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$7.7kUS$8.8kUS$7.0kUS$6.9kUS$6.4kUS$6.0kUS$5.6kUS$5.3kUS$5.0kUS$4.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$63bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.0%) = US$192bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$192b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$98bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$162b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$331, the company appears quite good value at a 37% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cigna as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.889. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for CignaStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

128,5cca03f8-9783-350d-a18e-0a9f42f956ed,WFC,2022-12-31,"With 74% ownership, Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/74-ownership-wells-fargo-company-110017102.html,1672484417,STORY,['WFC-PD'],"[A look at the shareholders of Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 74% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Wells Fargo. View our latest analysis for Wells Fargo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Wells Fargo. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Wells Fargo's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Wells Fargo is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.6% of shares outstanding. With 6.9% and 4.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Wells Fargo &amp; Company insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$91m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

With artful research and creative financial strategies, many investors can find stocks that will bring impressive returns and provide plenty of financial security.Take the time to understand a company’s financial statements, management decisions and goals before investing if you want maximum bang for your buck. It is vital to do so at this time, considering the bear market we experienced this year.Bank stocks took a hard hit after an encouraging 2021. One issue is that banks are closely tied to the conflict in Ukraine. In response to the crisis, loan growth has slowed down. Additionally, stock prices overall have been on a free fall since the start of 2022. Although the markets may seem unpredictable, bank stocks remain undervalued. The Federal Reserve is set to increase interest rates to meet its inflation goal of 2%, which sets up banks for increased earnings.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTo help you stay informed and prepared, we have a hand-selected mix of the best financial stocks to buy in 2023 that should not be overlooked. By thoroughly researching these options, you can play it safe while potentially earning impressive returns in an uncertain future market. Below is our list of the ten best financial stocks to buy in 2023.TOSTToast$17.15SOFISoFi Technologies$4.39INTUIntuit$383.11LMNDLemonade$13.41WFCWells Fargo$41.04CCitigroup$44.39FITBFifth Third Bancorp$32.80FRCFirst Republic Bank$119.68SBNYSignature Bank$113.98VVisa$206.29Toast (TOST)A close-up of a Toast (TOST) ordering screen.Source: TonelsonProductions / Shutterstock.comToast (NYSE:TOST) has developed a cloud solution for restaurants that helps them run their business smoothly. Due to the pandemic, it suffered through some of its worst years in 2020 and 2021. However, now things are getting back to normal, and recent financial results confirm this.Story continuesThe company’s numbers look promising, with a 55% rise in revenues year-over-year after Q3, and adjusted losses going down to $98 million from $254 million last year. The company also upgraded its outlook for the fourth quarter. Now, revenue is expected to be between $730 million and $760 million against a consensus analyst forecast of $725 million.However, this solid performance is not reflected in the markets. The stock is down over 50% in the year thus far. Investors are still cautious concerning the recovery of the restaurant market, which is reflected in Toast’s share price. However, in many countries, things are pretty normal. So, the stock can come back next year, making it one of the best financial stocks to buy. Shares are now being traded at a favorable price. If you’re thinking of investing in the next comeback story, now might be the right time to do so.SoFi Technologies (SOFI)An image of SoFi headquarters. SOFI stock.Source: Michael Vi / ShutterstockThis year, SoFi’s (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock price has taken a plunge. Shares are down more than 70% despite it being a great year for the fintech company. It completed the purchase of Golden Pacific Bancorp earlier this year, which means SoFi Technologies is now well and truly a bank. It no longer relies on third-party financial institutions to issue loans and provide deposit services. That puts it in a different league from other fintech players.In addition, SoFi’s personal loan business is increasingly profitable. According to recent reports, the success of that sector has allowed the firm to beat consensus expectations consistently. It also allows the online bank to circumvent the broader macroeconomic environment, despite mixed performance in other areas of its portfolio. This is great news for SoFi’s many customers and employees, who eagerly await the end of the student loan repayment pause to end.With its strong overall performance, SoFi appears to be on its way to a bright future. Furthermore, when the moratorium on student loan payments ends, SoFi will have back one of its best-performing segments. For these reasons, SoFi is one of the best financial stocks to buy.Intuit (INTU)Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) experienced impressive growth in the last fiscal year, with total revenue increasing by 32%, excluding the acquisition of email marketing provider MailChimp. It’s a testament to their business chops and financial acumen that they’ve come out on top in this difficult economic climate. Along with that comes premium stock prices. However, it’s for a good reason. Intuit remains competitive even when times are tough for its customers – small businesses and consumers who have been especially hard hit by current events.Intuit’s software tools have become indispensable resources, especially as belts are tightened amid an economic downturn. As a leader in tax software (Turbo Tax) and small business management solutions (QuickBooks, MailChimp), Intuit has been able to continue the positive trajectory of its small business segment. The performance comes despite budget cuts – with CFO Michelle Clatterbuck recently sharing the expectation that this sector will grow by an impressive 20% in fiscal 2023.From DIY-ers filing their taxes using Turbo Tax to businesses taking advantage of industry-leading fiscal solutions through QuickBooks and marketing assistance with MailChimp, Intuit possesses a robust operating model. Many of the segments are recession resistant. People need to manage their finances and file their returns. Growth in subscriber numbers might slow down for a couple of quarters. But the existing consumer base is incredibly sticky. The latest quarterly numbers show that revenue shot up 29%, despite a tough operating environment. That kind of performance is rare to find in the current market.Lemonade (LMND)Lemonade stock logo displayed on smartphone laying on top of computer keyboard.Source: Stephanie L Sanchez / Shutterstock.comLemonade’s (NYSE:LMND) entry into the insurance market is a major disruption to the industry – and with it comes great advantages for its technology and customers. Its use of machine learning provides the potential for a more accurate assessment of underwriting policies. It allows Lemonade to be competitive in pricing compared to traditional systems. Furthermore, the innovative approach has won them fans in the form of customers who enjoy their product and rave about their customer service. It is an advantage that takes time, investment and dedication to acquire. With these elements combined, Lemonade has placed itself as a major player in the market, ready for whatever may come next.Lemonade is proving its value by focusing on the in-force premium (IFP) as its top-line metric instead of revenue alone. The success in achieving high growth goals has resulted in a 76% increase in IFP since last year, with a 35% boost in premium per customer and a 30% jump in customer count. Moving forward, the company is committed to focusing on profitability. Despite the risk of utilizing machine learning to price policies, Lemonade is certain to offer an improved product. At the same time, it is consistently growing its market share.Lemonade has taken a similar turn as much of the tech industry, seeing a big fall in market cap this year. It’s trading at very attractive valuations and is worth keeping an eye on. Although it is a bit risky, it deserves a place on this list of financial stocks to buy because of its disruptive quality.Wells Fargo (WFC)Dividends Are the Best Reason to Hold Wells Fargo StockSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.comWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is one of the largest and most impressive banks in the United States. It offers an attractive risk-reward prospect for investors, making it an enticing option for those with high returns in mind.Wells Fargo has plans to make cost cutting a key focus area going into 2023 – this could be a major source of competitive differentiation between them and others. On top of this, the eventual abolition of its asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve presents another significant positive development. It can help attract more attention to the company come 2023.Wells Fargo &amp; Co. is slightly more attractive than other megabanks because it relies more on its consumer banking and lending arm than the investment banking business. It might not be by design, but the operating model for WFC is ideal in the current environment. In a turbulent economic climate, consumer banking has emerged as the saving grace for banks. While investment banking activity falters and markets continue to be bearish, people remain willing to take out loans with rising interest rates that generate much-needed income for financial institutions. Therefore, heading into 2023, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. is in a great position.Citigroup (C)The logo for Citigroup (C) can be seen on the side of an office building for the company.Source: Willy Barton / Shutterstock.comDespite a strong bearish market sentiment, now may be the time to take advantage of Citigroup’s (NYSE:C) underdog status. The current price offers significant upside potential regardless of what happens with Citi’s planned divestitures. The execution risk shouldn’t stop sophisticated investors willing to give them a chance and look past the recent roadblocks. It’s up to Citigroup to prove they have what it takes to get back on track, but the big payoff could be well worth it.Citigroup’s difficulties in 2022 reflect a challenging year of business operations. Unfortunately, its stock has plummeted close to 30%. Its value at the present low point has become a cause for further concern. The banking giant unveiled a multi-year transformation plan to improve its fortunes, yet the results were impaired due to several unforeseen obstacles encountered along the way. These delays were costly, allowing write-downs that affected contract invoicing and other financials. Moreover, Citigroup is contending with certain regulatory issues, while still operating under the looming threat of higher capital requirements.On the bright side, the investment bank is undergoing a major revamp of its consumer banking operations, setting the stage for an increasingly streamlined and profitable institution. By winding down or selling 14 international units – including Citibanamex in Mexico with remarkable returns – the bank will be able to hone in on core strengths such as investment banking, corporate banking and wealth management services. Making the business model more nimble is ideal, especially in a volatile market. It sets up Citigroup nicely for 2023 and beyond, sealing its fate among financial stocks to buy.Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB)Fifth Third Bank sign on brick buildingSource: Susan Montgomery / Shutterstock.comFifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) is an impressive regional bank with increasing reach, strong finances and impressive products. Their expanding presence in the Southeast region ensures more customers can access their high-quality banking services, which include retail and commercial banking, consumer lending and asset management. The bank’s solid footing also provides a great foundation for outperformance when market conditions become turbulent – as they always do.Furthermore, Fifth Third has seen improving credit quality over the past few years, which will protect them during an economic recession. The pandemic’s dramatic economic downturn left banks facing a critical test: evaluating and preparing for the heightened risk of loan defaults. At Fifth Third Bancorp, management shone under pressure. It did exceedingly well by accurately predicting potential losses while prudently setting aside reserves to cover them. The accomplishment is worthy of praise in uncertain times. That performance is carrying through even after the pandemic. Moreover, their technological advancements have not been appreciated by the market yet.All these factors make Fifth Third Bancorp a great choice for investors looking to buy financial stocks for long-term growth potential.First Republic Bank (FRC)A First Republic Bank branch in the Financial District of San Francisco, CaliforniaSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comFirst Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) is a great example of how excellent customer service can build strong and lasting relationships. Having been in operation for the past four decades, their commitment to providing private consumer and business banking and private wealth management in New York and California has resulted in hard-earned customer loyalty.First Republic Bank did not do well this year like other financial stocks. Part of the reason is the wider economic downturn. However, Co-CEO James Herbert taking a leave also played a part. However, the company recently reported a revenue increase of 16.9% YoY, and net income rose 21%. Therefore, there is a feeling abound that the stock has been harshly treated.Over the last four quarters, First Republic Bank has consistently posted healthy earnings. They far exceeded even the most optimistic of analysts’ predictions. This extraordinary performance should not be taken lightly – it is a testimony to the incredible management, leadership and competent staff that has enabled this financial institution to stand out as a leader in its field. With this consistent success over such an extended period, First Republic Bank will reap greater rewards. Investors are sure to take notice and respond accordingly.Signature Bank (SBNY)The logo for Signature Bank is displayed over the entrance to a building.Source: PL Gould / Shutterstock.comSignature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY) is a prominent commercial banking institution with assets valued at $114.47 billion in the third quarter of 2022. Despite recent market turbulence caused by FTX bankruptcy and cryptocurrency contagion anxiety among some investors, shares are attractive as experts anticipate a Federal Reserve rate increase to factor in future conditions.Signature Bank is certainly conscious of the FTX debacle. (If you want to take a deep dive into the collapse, here is a great piece from Luke Lango that gives a great blow-by-blow account. Louis Navellier has you covered if you want to know how to navigate the future of crypto investing, particularly in the case of tokens.) It decided to end digital asset-associated deposits, as they only had a deposit relationship with FTX, citing volatility due to recent events. This news sent ripples through the marketplace, leaving executives and enthusiasts alike wondering what’s next for digital assets.Signature Bank has long been at the forefront of fintech innovation. It offers a revolutionary payments platform tailored specifically to crypto exchanges and clients. Operating 24/7, Signet – as it’s called- provides users with real-time payment solutions, allowing instantaneous transactions within their portfolios. As an added benefit of using this service, customers can place large non-interest-bearing deposits into Signature bank accounts, further driving global financial developments.In 2021, Signature had an impressive year following its foray into crypto services. Unfortunately, market developments have since caused the company to scale back operations and reassess its situation. Most notably, the collapse of FTX sent ripples throughout the industry as it spread contagion to other prominent players in this sector. However, despite suffering losses along with many others, Signature escaped relatively unscathed. It did not possess substantial deposits connected with FTX, and further streamlining the business certainly can’t hurt.Visa (V)Visa logo outside of an office buildingSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) has undergone a remarkable transformation; From its humble beginnings as an ordinary payments network, it is now a powerful force in the rapidly growing field of financial technology. Fintech’s development and adoption have surged during these challenging times – indeed, Visa stands at the heart of this revolution.Unlike several other financial stocks investors are looking to buy, Visa did well this year. The stock is down close to 5%. This news will not stop the presses. However, the price movement becomes notable when you compare it to the S&amp;P 500, which is down almost 20% this year.Visa helps to power commerce around the world with its innovative payment network. In 2022, it propelled over $14 trillion in global sales. In addition, the payment processing company facilitated more than 250 billion transactions across over 80 million merchants worldwide. Boasting an impressive 3.9 billion cardholders, Visa continues to lead the way in digital payments processing networks on a grand scale. Despite a tough 2022, it still managed top-line growth of 19% in its latest quarter. In addition, Visa’s earnings outlook assumes ‘no recession’ and relieved investors spooked by the markets. Heading into 2023 puts Visa in a great position.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The industry is also contending with inflation and supply chain constraints that have led to higher manufacturing costs.The increases are on list prices, which do not include rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and other discounts.In 2022, drugmakers raised prices on more than 1,400 drugs according to data published by 46brooklyn, a drug pricing non-profit that is related to 3 Axis. That is the most increases since 2015.The median drug price increase was 4.9% last year, while the average increase was 6.4%, according to 46brooklyn. Both figures are lower than inflation rates in the United States.Drugmakers largely have kept increases at 10% or below - an industry practice followed by many big drugmakers since they came under fire for too many price hikes in the middle of the last decade.Antonio Ciaccia, president of 3 Axis, said that drugmakers have focused on launching their drugs at higher prices because of the attention paid to annual price increases. The IRA should further this dynamic, he said.""Drug makers have to take a harder look at calibrating those launch prices out of the gate ... so they don't box themselves into the point where in the future, they can't price increase their way back into profitability,"" he said.More drug prices are likely to be announced over the course of January - historically the biggest month for drugmakers to raise prices.Story continuesTo date, Pfizer announced the most increases, with prices rising on 89 unique drug brands, and an additional increase on 10 drug brands at its Hospira arm.That was followed by GSK, with planned increases so far on 26 unique drugs, including nearly a 7% increase on its popular shingles vaccine Shingrix.GSK was not immediately available for comment.Notable increases expected include 9% price hikes on Bristol Myers Squibb's personalized CAR-T cell therapies Abecma and Breyanzi, both of which were already more than $400,000 for the blood cancer treatments.A company spokesperson said there were several driving factors in increasing the list price of the two CAR-T cell therapies, including the rate of inflation, the value of the therapies, and the personalized nature of the CAR-T manufacturing process.Increases for Pfizer include a 6% rise on the cost of Xeljanz, a treatment for autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, and 7.9% increases on cancer drugs Ibrance and Xalkori.A Pfizer spokesperson said in an email that the company's average list prices for drugs and vaccines in 2023 are well below overall inflation at approximately 3.6%, noting that the increases are needed to support investments in drug discovery.Pfizer noted that net prices - those the company actually receives for its drugs - have fallen in the past four years because of higher rebates and discounts paid to insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers.AstraZeneca is set to raise prices in the 3% range on blood cancer treatment Calquence, non-small cell lung cancer drug Tagrisso and asthma treatment Fasenra.""AstraZeneca has always taken a thoughtful approach to pricing, and we continue to do so, considering many factors,"" said company spokesman Brendan McEvoy.In addition to significant R&amp;D investments, McEvoy said AstraZeneca considers clinical value, size of patient population, government/payer coverage requirements, patient affordability, competition and other market conditions.Sanofi plans to raise prices on 14 of its drugs or vaccines.A Sanofi spokesperson said the drugmaker's 2023 pricing actions are consistent with its approach to responsible pricing, adherence to government policies, and the need to respond to evolving trends in the marketplace.(Reporting by Michael Erman and Julie Steenhuysen; editing by Diane Craft)]"

The key secondary endpoints also showed a 78% reduction in treated ABR and a 92% reduction in annualized infusion rate. The company plans to present additional data from the BENGENE-2 study at a future medical meeting.Pfizer intends to discuss this data with regulatory authorities in early 2023.Shares of Pfizer have lost 13.1% in the year against the industry’s 11.7% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHemophilia B is a rare bleeding disorder caused by a missing FIX, known as the clotting protein. Symptoms of the disease include profuse bleeding after an injury, surgery and sometimes even without a clear cause. These bleeding episodes can lead to serious complications for an individual.Fidanacogene elaparvovec is a one-time gene therapy product consisting of a bio-engineered AAV capsid and a high-activity human coagulation FIX gene. The treatment aims to allow patients to produce FIX themselves without the need to receiving exogenous FIX.Pfizer has in-licensed fidanacogene elaparvovec gene therapy from Spark Therapeutics, a subsidiary of Roche RHHBY. The deal was entered into in 2018, a year prior to the acquisition of Spark Therapeutics by Roche in 2019. Per the terms of the licensing deal with the Roche-subsidiary, Pfizer is solely responsible for all pivotal studies as well as the potential commercialization of fidanacogene elaparvovec.Story continuesIf approved, Pfizer’s gene therapy will face competition from Hemgenix, a one-time gene therapy that was approved by the FDA last month for the treatment of hemophilia B in patients older than 18 years. Hemgenix has been developed by uniQure QURE in partnership with CSL Behring, the latter being a subsidiary of CSL Limited. Following approval, uniQure/CSL’s Hemgenix became the first FDA-approved gene therapy for treating hemophilia B.The FDA’s approval of uniQure/CSL’s Hemgenix was based on results from the pivotal HOPE-B study, which demonstrated that following infusion with the gene-therapy, patients produced mean FIX activity of 39% at six months and 36.7% at 24 months. The mean adjusted ABR for all bleeds was also reduced by 54% after seven to 18 months of administering Hemgenix. The clinical development program for HEMGENIX was initially led by uniQure, which was subsequently transferred to CSL after it acquired global rights to commercialize the treatment.Pfizer Inc.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) earns a Zacks Rank #3 14 days from its next quarterly earnings release on January 13, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $5.19 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $5.19 Most Accurate Estimate and the $5.17 Zacks Consensus Estimate, UnitedHealth Group has an Earnings ESP of 0.28%.UNH is part of a big group of Medical stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Pfizer (PFE) as well.Pfizer, which is readying to report earnings on February 14, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.12 a share, and PFE is 46 days out from its next earnings report.Pfizer's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 3.06% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09.Story continuesUNH and PFE's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The Japanese regulatory authority approved a combination of AstraZeneca’s AZN immunotherapies, Imfinzi (durvalumab) and Imjudo (tremelimumab), for two cancer types, advanced liver and lung cancer.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesFDA Approves Roche’s Lunsumio (mosunetuzumab): The FDA approved Roche’s CD20xCD3 T cell engaging bispecific antibody, Lunsumio (mosunetuzumab) , for treating relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. The accelerated approval is for adult patients who have been treated with two or more lines of systemic therapy. Lunsumio was approved for a similar indication in the European Union earlier this June. Off-the-shelf cancer immunotherapy, Lunsumio will help treat patients who do not respond to multiple lines of treatment and help them achieve disease remission. A commercial launch of the therapy is expected in the coming weeks.FDA’s Accepts Pfizer’s Meningococcal Vaccine BLA: The FDA accepted and granted standard review to Pfizer’s biologics license application (BLA) seeking approval of its pentavalent meningococcal vaccine candidate (MenABCWY). The BLA seeks approval of MenABCWY for adolescents and young adults, 10-25 years of age, for the prevention of meningococcal disease caused by five meningococcal serogroups that cause the majority of invasive meningococcal disease: serogroups A, B, C, W and Y. The FDA assigned a standard review to the BLA, with a decision expected in October 2023. A pentavalent vaccine, if approved, can simplify what is currently a complex meningococcal vaccination schedule in the country.Pfizer’s phase III study on hemophilia B gene therapy candidate, fidanacogene elaparvovec, met its primary endpoint. The primary endpoint of the study was non-inferiority and superiority in the annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of total bleeds post-fidanacogene elaparvovec infusion versus prophylaxis regimen with Factor IX (FIX), administered as part of regular care. In the study, a single dose of 5e11 vg/kg of fidanacogene elaparvovec resulted in a 71% reduction in ABR. Key secondary endpoints demonstrated a 78% reduction in treated ABR and a 92% reduction in annualized infusion rate. Pfizer plans to share this data with regulatory authorities in early 2023.Story continuesAstraZeneca’s Imfinzi+Imjudo Gets Japan Nod for 3 Cancers: The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved AstraZeneca’s dual immunotherapy regimen, comprising PD-L1 inhibitor Imfinzi plus CTLA-4 antibody Imjudo (tremelimumab), in combination with chemotherapy, for treating unresectable, advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The MHLW also approved the Imfinzi+Imjudo combination for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer. Imfinzi plus Imjudo was approved by the FDA for advanced liver and NSCLC cancers in October/November. The Japanese regulatory authorities also approved Imfinzi as monotherapy for unresectable HCC and curatively unresectable biliary tract cancer in combination with chemotherapy.The MHLW also granted approval to AstraZeneca’s BTK inhibitor, Calquence as a first-line treatment for adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (including small lymphocytic lymphoma). Calquence is already approved in Japan for treating relapsed or refractory CLL. It is approved for both treatment-naïve and relapsed or refractory settings in several countries, including the United States and Europe, and also for mantle cell lymphoma in the United States and some other countries.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index rose 0.25% in the last five trading sessions.Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnHere’s how the eight major stocks performed in the last five trading sessions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the last five trading sessions, Novartis rose the most (0.8%), while Roche declined the most (0.9%).In the past six months, Merck rose the most (19.9%), while Roche declined the most (5.8%).(See the last pharma stock roundup here:LLY’s 2023 View, MRK-MRNA Joint Cancer Vaccine Data &amp; More)What's Next in the Pharma World?Watch out for regular pipeline and regulatory updates next week.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:PYPL) stock in the last year have seen some of their losses recouped as the stock gained 3.2% last week. The purchase, however, has proven to be a pricey bet, with losses currently totalling US$1.3m.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings PayPal Holdings Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive Vice President of Global Sales, Peggy Alford, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.1m worth of shares at a price of US$97.82 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$71.22. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. Peggy Alford was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 33.36k shares worth US$3.7m. But they sold 21.79k shares for US$2.1m. In total, PayPal Holdings insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Does PayPal Holdings Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that PayPal Holdings insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$100m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The PayPal Holdings Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no PayPal Holdings insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, PayPal Holdings insiders feel good about the company's future.

(PYPL) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-paypal-holdings-inc-140002235.html,1672408802,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Paypal (PYPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned -10.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Paypal falls in, has gained 2.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.08 points to a change of -11.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.79 indicates a change of +17.3% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool — the Zacks Rank — is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PYPL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Paypal, the consensus sales estimate of $7.39 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +6.8%. The $27.52 billion and $29.82 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8.5% and +8.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $6.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.7%. EPS of $1.08 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.4%. The EPS surprise was +13.68%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Biggest Stocks that Benefit from Rising Interest Rates.The US Federal Reserve has increased the benchmark interest rates to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% in December 2022. This is the highest benchmark interest rate since December 2007. The move has been made to combat raging inflation that reached a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022 and recorded an increase of 7.1% YoY in November 2022. The Federal Reserve has warned of further interest rate hikes in 2023 and has provided a median benchmark interest rate guidance of 5.1% for the next year. The increase in the benchmark interest rates is expected to tighten the economy and bring inflation back to the Federal Reserve’s long-term target of 2%.The developments related to interest rate changes require close attention from investors. In circumstances where interest rates are on the rise and the economy is showing signs of improvement, numerous opportunities rise in the world of equities. According to a top adviser to the president, the White House is confident that the US economy can still achieve a “soft landing” as the significant public investments made by Joe Biden will provide support to the job market in the coming months. Despite the Fed Reserve’s monetary tightening in full force over the previous three months, the US labor market outperformed expectations and posted an average monthly job increase of 272,000.Certain businesses, such as those belonging to the financial sector, are likely to experience a tailwind as an increase in interest rates results in higher profit margins. Meanwhile, brokerage institutions start to experience an increase in trading activity as the economy starts to recover and also experience higher interest income due to surging interest rates. However, this does not mean that investors should remain restricted to the financial sector only. Retailers and consumer companies also experience positive momentum as the economy starts to recover. Companies such as  JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) are amongst some of the biggest stocks that stand to benefit from rising interest rates.Story continues12 Biggest Stocks that Benefit from Rising Interest RatesPhoto by Nicholas Cappello on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have analyzed the business models of numerous companies to assess the impact of the rising interest rates on their financial strength and growth plans. According to experts, the majority of the companies that are expected to benefit from rising interest rates belong to the financial sector.

Rising interest rates are expected to boost their profit margins in the coming quarters. Furthermore, we have also included some leading names from the consumer goods and home improvement retail sector. These stocks have been ranked according to the hedge fund sentiment as of Q3 2022.12 Biggest Stocks that Benefit from Rising Interest Rates12. Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) is a Cottonwood Heights, Utah-based real estate investment trust (REIT) founded in 1977 that is focused on investing in self-storage units.Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) carries a significant amount of debt as it buys self-storage properties on mortgages. However, around 62% of the company’s total debt is on a fixed interest rate of 3.2% only as of Q3 2022. This will play in favor of Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) during a period of rising interest rates, as the company will observe significant savings on financing costs. In a research report released on December 5, Ki Bin Kim at Truist assigned Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) stock a target price of $175 and reiterated a Buy rating following the Q3 2022 results and the recent developments taking place in the self-storage REIT industry.Baron Funds shared its stance on Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Following a sharp correction in its share price during the second quarter, we acquired shares in Extra Space Storage Inc. This REIT has assembled the second-largest self-storage portfolio in the country and has the largest portfolio of third-party managed self-storage facilities. In our opinion, Extra Space’s management team is excellent. Over the last decade, management has delivered strong occupancy gains, rent growth, and expense control that has led to a cost of capital advantage relative to its peers. Management has capitalized on its cost of capital advantage by tripling its owned self-storage count since 2010. We believe the long-term growth opportunity for the company remains strong.”11. Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS) is a Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based operator of departmental store chains across the US.

Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) is a Findlay, Ohio-based refining, marketing, and transportation provider of petroleum products.The company is expected to save significantly during the rising interest rate environment due to its low debt levels. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) has been lowering its debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio since March 2020. Experts anticipate Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) to have a strong 2023 as the refining market is expected to remain under pressure due to supply-related limitations that would support a high-margin environment like 2022. For the recently ended quarter, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) increased its dividend by about 30%. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) strives to have each of its assets produce free cash flow for the company and increase returns to shareholders.As of Q3 2022, Paul Singer’s Elliot Management was the biggest hedge fund holder of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) stock, with a stake of over $1 billion.Here’s what Clark Street Value said about Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“During the worst of covid, I bought some LEAPs on Marathon Petroleum (MPC) as a proxy for Par Pacific (PARR) since long dated options weren’t available on the later.  Those MPC calls expire next month and I’ll take profits, with PARR I’ve reduced my position throughout the year and might sell the rest early next year, I’ve owned it for 6-7 years and it has gone nowhere, they haven’t touched the NOLs, just a difficult business that I probably don’t understand as well as I should.”7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an Issaquah, Washington-based operator of membership-only big-box retail stores.The strong membership model operated by the company is insulated from the volatility in the discretionary retail sector due to rising interest rates and inflation. There are strong expectations that increasing interest rates and high inflation will increase membership rates as consumers look to benefit from discounts. Furthermore, numerous members are now becoming executive members, who must pay a double membership fee in exchange for an extra 2% discount while shopping at Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST).On December 21, Ivan Feinseth at Tigress Financial gave Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock a target price of $635, along with a Buy rating. The analyst highlighted the recent dip in the stock price as an attractive buying opportunity for investors.Here’s what Cooper Investors said about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”6. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a New York-based investment bank and a diversified financial services company.The company is preparing itself to benefit from a rising interest rate environment by broadening its partnership with Apple Inc.

(NYSE:GS) is working with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to develop high-yielding savings account along with a buy now pay later (BNPL) plan that would be exclusively available to customers of Apple. This reflects The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (NYSE:GS) intention to provide consumer banking services through the digital medium without opting for full-fledged physical operations.ClearBridge Investments discussed its stance on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We also initiated a new position in The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), which is trading far below what we would expect of a well-capitalized financials stock capable of generating an attractive return on equity over a market cycle. The company’s prospects are further enhanced by strong market share gains and further buildout of its fintech consumer finance initiatives.Additionally, its earnings appear to have stabilized from the peak deal activity and inflated asset valuations of the last market cycle. While we acknowledge that a full-blown recession would put pressure on these earnings, Goldman Sachs has a history of capitalizing on downcycles to solidify its leading investment and trading businesses.”In addition to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and The Home Depot, Inc.

NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / December 30, 2022 / Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) works diligently to prevent incidents throughout its operations and maintain robust preparedness to enable an effective response if an emergency event occurs. This commitment to response readiness is reflected through its continuous training, including 20 multi-agency, worst-case oil spill exercises in 2022 alone as well as numerous smaller drills and tabletop exercises that were regulatorily required. MPC demonstrated its capabilities for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the fall during one of the year's largest drills, a regional response exercise in which MPC teams successfully collaborated with 125 participants from 14 federal, state and local agencies, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Three Affiliated Tribes, and BNSF Railway.The two-day drill at MPC's Mandan, North Dakota, refinery was organized by EPA Region 8, which covers North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado. Planning with MPC began in the spring to allow time to address the event's size and scope. It was a full-scale exercise, meaning it simulated an actual emergency with containment and recovery equipment, an incident command post and ongoing updates in real time that prompted decisions and actions intended to help validate preparedness.""By working together with our response partners, we can reduce impacts of both natural and humanmade disasters on people, the economy, and the environment"" said Betsy Smidinger, Director of U.S. EPA Region 8's Superfund and Emergency Management Division. ""Partnering with Marathon, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the state of North Dakota and city and county emergency management entities in the full-scale exercise allowed us to work through, and evaluate the effectiveness of, our response protocols in a setting that simulates the real-world challenges we could face in a true emergency.""Story continuesTeamwork leads the wayUnder the exercise scenario, drill participants acted as if they were responding to an oil spill at the refinery's tank farm that led to oil reaching the nearby Missouri River. On the drill's first day, the refinery fire department's emergency response team deployed booms on the river to demonstrate how spill containment would look.""Showcasing the Mandan team's ability for all the agencies was priceless,"" said MPC Emergency Preparedness Coordinator Servil Hoff. ""This is an aspect that most people don't ever see, including the process of boom deployment with recovery and all the equipment and resources that are required.""The second day involved running an incident command post and organizing a unified command team to manage the response. Refinery General Manager Chris Staats was the incident commander. Other refinery personnel, MPC employees from across the company and agency members also filled roles. The unified command team included federal, state, local and tribal on-scene coordinators.""EPA wanted to make sure Standing Rock was involved to show them the ability of the refinery to respond and to ensure them that we are all united if an incident were to happen,"" Hoff said.Mandan Refinery Fire Chief Jamie Reinholt pointed to this emphasis on cooperation as a major factor behind the drill's overall success. He noted the positive feedback from third-party evaluators who were on site throughout the exercise.""All observers had great comments from both days. The planning teams worked great together, groups were engaged and well-prepared, and it showed,"" Reinholt said.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Molson Coors Beverage Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.18bUS$1.18bUS$1.11bUS$1.46bUS$1.20bUS$1.05bUS$964.0mUS$915.4mUS$888.5mUS$875.5mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -12.35%Est @ -8.05%Est @ -5.04%Est @ -2.93%Est @ -1.46% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$903US$1.1kUS$849US$694US$596US$529US$479US$441(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.7bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$876m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.0%) = US$17bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$17b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$8.8bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$17b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$51.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 32% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Molson Coors Beverage as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.920. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Molson Coors BeverageStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Beverage market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

150,71f53f25-124d-4c17-ba33-31fba6c08a73,GM,2022-12-31,EV tax credit for consumer leases a ‘positive development for industry’,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ev-tax-credit-for-consumer-leases-a-positive-development-for-industry-181335292.html,1672424015,STORY,"['FSR', 'TM', 'TOYOF', 'TSLA', 'GM', 'VLKAF', 'VLKPF', 'VWAGY', 'VWAPY', 'RIVN', 'F']","[The Treasury Department and the IRS issued some new guidelines on the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) EV tax credit, and for the time being it is bringing foreign automakers — and U.S. consumers — some good news ahead of the new year.Recall that the consumer tax credit for EVs as outlined in the IRA required (1) vehicles to be below a certain price ($55,000 for cars, $80,000 for SUVs and pickups), (2) buyers' income to be $300K in adjusted gross income or below for joint filers and $150K for single filers, (3) a percentage of critical battery materials and battery assembly to be U.S. based, and (4) final assembly of the vehicle to take place in North America.It is that last requirement that has tripped up foreign automakers for obvious reasons. However, new guidance from the IRS details that leasing EVs, which falls under the commercial EV credit of the law (known as 45W credit for commercial clean vehicles) could offer a loophole.The commercial clean vehicles portion of the law doesn’t require North American assembly or income requirements for that matter. In the new guidance released by the IRS, the agency essentially said a taxpayer that leases a clean vehicle to customers is eligible to claim the commercial EV credit.In this case, the “taxpayer” could be the financing arm of an automaker or a bank the dealer works with (or dealer itself who provides financing), who originates the lease would take the $7,500 credit, but then would pass on the savings to the lessee, or consumer, in the form of reduced lease payments.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation (AAI), a trade group backed by a number of automakers, sees the new guidance by Treasury and the IRS as a positive development.""Finally, the Treasury Department issued guidance clarifying the $7,500 credit for EVs acquired via a lease – aka the 45W credit for commercial clean vehicles,” said John Bozzela, president of the AAI. “That’s consistent with our recommendation and a positive development for broad adoption of EVs in the U.S. as production and supply chains localize – a goal industry and policymakers share.""Story continuesHowever, Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), who was instrumental in crafting the IRA’s EV tax credit regime and securing passage of the legislation in general is not happy about the IRS’s interpretation of the commercial EV credit for consumer lease purposes. Manchin believes this interpretation of lease provision is a means for foreign automakers to benefit from a law that was designed to encourage North American manufacturing.Yahoo Finance reached out to a number of foreign and domestic automakers to get their response to the new EV lease guidelines. While a few automakers who responded are still reviewing the guidelines (Hyundai, Toyota, BMW, Polestar), and others refer back to the AAI statement (Honda, Porsche), a couple automakers did directly respond. It should be noted that many automakers' corporate offices are closed during the holiday period and have not been able to respond back to Yahoo Finance requests for comment.GM""Tax credits are a proven accelerator of electric vehicle adoption and we are excited that qualifying customers will be able to take advantage of our eligible EVs.""Fisker Inc.“Fisker supports any effort by the U.S. government to make EV ownership more attractive to consumers – and that accelerates our transition away from ICE vehicles. Fisker is actively exploring US assembly of the Fisker Ocean SUV, and we intend to manufacture our next vehicle, the Fisker PEAR urban lifestyle vehicle, in Ohio.”Mercedes-Benz“There are four discrete limitations (1) Mineral sourcing from certain countries, (2) Final assembly in North America, (3) Household income limitation, (4) MSRP in the Inflation Reduction Act that are individually and collectively challenging for the industry in general and also for Mercedes-Benz in the near-term. Independent of this legislation, we were already strengthening our global supply and production networks to support the transition to a fully electric future. We are reviewing the new guidance issued by the Treasury today (12/29/22) and the anticipated additional regulations over the coming days with a view toward the impact for our company and customers.”Confusing requirements for eligible EVsNEPHI, UT - JULY 17: A line of Tesla cars charge on July 17, 2022 in Nephi, Utah. With more electric cars on the road, lack of charging infrastructure is becoming more of a problem for EV owners. (Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)The IRS also released a list of vehicles eligible for the 2023 EV tax credit for consumers for purchase. The list, which will be updated as automakers submit vehicles that are eligible for EV tax credit, includes automakers like Ford, GM, Nissan, Rivian, and Tesla.However the list of vehicles and their characterizations as a traditional vehicle (subject to $55,000 MSRP cap), or SUV, van or pickup truck (subject to $80,000 MSRP cap) seems somewhat arbitrary.For instance, the Tesla Model Y 5-seat variant is subject to the $55,000 cap, whereas the Tesla Model Y 7 seat variant falls under the $80,000 cap, when two vehicles are otherwise identical in size. On the other hand, Volkswagen’s ID.4 is subject to the $55,000 cap, but the all-wheel drive version gets the $80,000 cap.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Intuitive Surgical's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intuitive Surgical is:12% = US$1.4b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.12 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Intuitive Surgical's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo begin with, Intuitive Surgical seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 11%. This certainly adds some context to Intuitive Surgical's moderate 13% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Intuitive Surgical's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 17% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Intuitive Surgical fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Intuitive Surgical Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Given that Intuitive Surgical doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Intuitive Surgical's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

Today’s Research Daily features an update on the evolving earnings picture for 2023 and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) and CSX Corporation (CSX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Earnings Outlook for 2023Multiple forces are at play in driving stock prices at any point in time. But the two biggest forces in the long run are interest rates and corporate earnings, with our focus in this note solely on the earnings part.Aggregate bottom-up earnings for the S&amp;P 500 index are currently expected to be up +2.2% in 2023 on +2.1% higher revenues. This would follow the +4.7% earnings growth in 2022 on +10.6% higher revenues.Estimates for 2023 have been steadily coming down, after peaking in mid-April 2022. In the aggregate, S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates have declined by -9.4% since mid-April for the index as a whole and -11.8% excluding the Energy sector.Estimates have been cut for 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest cuts to estimates for the Construction (Negative revision of -29.6% since mid-April), Consumer Discretionary (-21.5%), Retail (-21.2%), Tech (-19.6%), Industrials (-13.8%), Aerospace (-13.7%), and Transportation (-10.2%). Estimates for Energy, Utilities, Autos and Basic Materials have modestly increased.The future course of revisions will depend on how the underlying economic outlook unfolds in response to the Fed tightening cycle.I am of the opinion that a relatively a benign outcome for the U.S. economy where it is able to dodge a nasty recession will be consistent with an earnings outlook that is roughly in-line with current earnings estimates.I am not suggesting that estimates do not need to come down further. But rather that with aggregate estimates outside of the Energy sector already down by almost -12% since mid-April, there may not be a whole lot of further room to fall as long as the economic outlook doesn't materially deteriorate.Story continuesToday's Featured Research ReportsShares of Apple have declined -27.9% over the past year against the Zacks Tech sector's decline of -37.3% and the S&amp;P 500 index's -20.9% pullback. The Zacks analyst believes that Apple’s holiday season iPhone shipments are expected to suffer from disruptions at its Chinese partner Foxconn’s factory in Zhengzhou. We expect Apple to ship roughly 70 million iPhones in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.The company expects year-over-year revenue growth to decelerate in the fiscal first quarter compared with the fiscal fourth quarter due to unfavorable forex. Mac revenues are expected to be negatively impacted by forex. Apple expects Mac revenues to decline substantially year over year during the December quarter.Services revenue growth is expected to be negatively impacted by challenging macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable forex, as well as weakness in digital advertising and gaming. Nevertheless, a growing subscriber base in the Services business and a strong liquidity position are key catalysts.(You can read the full research report on Apple here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson have gained +3.1% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +12.3%. The Zacks analyst believes that J&amp;J’s sales in the MedTech unit are recovering and the company is focusing on growing this business through new products. J&amp;J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions.However, macroeconomic headwinds like inflationary pressure, rising input costs and negative currency impact are hurting margins. Headwinds like generic competition and pricing pressure continue. Stelara’s upcoming loss of exclusivity in 2023 is a concern. Though J&amp;J has taken meaningful steps to resolve its talc and opioid litigation, they continue to remain an overhang on the stock.(You can read the full research report on Johnson &amp; Johnson here &gt;&gt;&gt;)CSX shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past six months (+6.5% vs. +3.5%). The Zacks analyst believes that CSX is benefiting from higher export coal volumes, domestic intermodal shipments and favorable pricing. With the demand scenario expected to remain strong, despite the current market bloodbath, management anticipates double-digit growth in operating income and revenues for 2022 from 2021's reported levels.However, supply-chain disturbances are hurting CSX's operations. Weakness in the merchandise segment due to lower volumes of fertilizers is concerning. High costs, primarily due to escalating fuel expenses, pose a threat to CSX’s bottom line. High capital expenditures are also worrisome.(You can read the full research report on CSX here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Halliburton Company (HAL), American International Group, Inc.

In fiscal first-quarter its online sales grew modestly year-on-year despite lock-down led weakness in key Chinese e-commerce platforms.Electronic Focus &amp; Low Costs Aid Interactive Brokers (IBKR)Per the Zacks analyst, Interactive Brokers' continued focus on the Electronic Brokerage segment along with lower level of compensation costs and development of proprietary software will aid profits.JAKKS Pacific (JAKK) Banks on Digitization Efforts, Costs HighPer the Zacks analyst, JAKKS Pacific's consistent focus on product expansions and digital initiatives bode well. However, increased freight expenses and a strained supply chain pose concerns.AIG Benefits From Strong Revenues and Cost-Control MeasuresPer the Zacks analyst, higher premiums combined with rate hikes in the Commercial lines business will drive revenues. Cost-saving efforts should aid margins.Strength in Thrombectomy Portfolio Aid Surmodics (SRDX)The Zacks analyst is upbeat about Surmodics' potential in its thrombectomy platform technology despite its operation in a highly competitive market.New UpgradesHalliburton (HAL) to Benefit from North American ExposureThe Zacks analyst believes that Halliburton can take advantage of the tight fundamentals of the North American land drilling space through its market-leading pressure pumping operations.ProPetro (PUMP) to Benefit from Debt-Free Balance SheetThe Zacks analyst likes ProPetro's strong balance sheet, which has got zero debt to go with $43.2 million in cash $155 million available in the form of total liquidity.Reinsurance Group (RGA) Gains on Solid U.S. &amp; Latin American MarketPer the Zacks analyst, solid performance at the U.S. and Latin American traditional market backed by organic growth and new sales have been driving premium growth at the company.New DowngradesC.H. Robinson (CHRW) Hit Hard by Operating Cost ChallengesThe Zacks analyst is worried about the elevated operating expenses. High costs are hurting C.H. Robinson's bottom line.

Battery metal lead, sustained by tight supplies, low inventories and inclusion in a commodity index from January, has fared better, dropping only 15% since March.Spiralling inflation, COVID lockdowns in top consumer China and aggressive interest rate rises are behind economic weakness and dwindling demand growth for industrial metals such as copper, used in the power and construction industries.""The macro picture in 2023 rhymes with 2022 and many of the crises that developed this year will reverberate into the next,"" Bank of America analysts said in a note.However, BoA noted that metals prices had already fallen significantly and that they would outperform energy in the first half of next year.The knee-jerk reaction to China's recent easing of COVID controls was to drive up prices of metals such as aluminium, used in transport, packaging and construction, but a surge in infections has prompted a rethink.Higher U.S. interest rates mean a stronger U.S. currency; a double whammy for dollar-priced copper, which was trading at $8,450 a tonne at 1210 GMT, and aluminium at $2,420, zinc at $3,000, lead at $2,290, tin at $25,350 and nickel at $30,530.""We expect copper to fall to $7,800 a tonne over the next three months as an end to finished goods restocking, higher smelter output, seasonal weakness, and weakness in global end-use consumption drives the market into surplus,"" Citi analysts said in a note.The picture for nickel is clouded by March's trading fiasco on the London Metal Exchange, which created a confidence crisis in the contract leading to sliding volumes and liquidity.Story continues""While these conditions persist, we can expect continued episodes of elevated nickel price volatility, although we think our bearish fundamental view will ultimately win out,"" Citi said.Used mainly to make stainless steel, nickel is now also a key material for electric vehicle batteries.For soldering material tin, a major theme is consumer belt tightening, which has hit demand for electronic goods.""Slowing (tin) demand is perhaps best illustrated by global semiconductor billings, which had retraced 18% by September, since reaching an all-time high in February,"" Macquarie analysts said in a note.(Reporting by Pratima Desai; editing by Kirsten Donovan)]"

IPAR. The provider of fragrances and related products is benefiting from solid brand performance.These abovementioned upsides have boosted third-quarter 2022 results, with the top and bottom lines increasing year over year. The solid performance prompted management to raise its 2022 view. Impressively, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s stock has rallied 28.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 8.4% growth.Let’s discuss this in detail.Brand Strength Boosts GrowthIn the third quarter of 2022, Inter Parfums’ U.S.-based product sales amounted to $82 million, increasing 45% year over year. In the company’s U.S. operations, new brands like Ferragamo, Donna Karan and DKNY generated 41% of the gains. Apart from this, organic growth from established brands like GUESS, Oscar de la Renta, Hollister and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch also contributed to the upside.Quarterly sales of its European operations increased 12% in euros, with the three largest brands, Montblanc, Jimmy Choo and Coach, outperforming by 11%, 32% and 3% year over year, respectively. Several mid-sized brands, namely Kate Spade, Rochas, Boucheron, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels and Karl Lagerfeld, also witnessed comparable quarter sales growth. That being said, a 17% decline in the average euro-to-dollar exchange rate masked such an upside resulting in a 4% drop in the quarterly European-based product sales in dollars.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBright ViewThe company is optimistic about its business prospects and continues investing to gain market share and long-term growth. Management now expects 2022 net sales of $1.025 billion, up from previous guidance of $1 billion. Earnings per share are anticipated to come in at $3.40, higher than the earlier guidance of $3.25.For 2023, management anticipates net sales of $1.11 billion, which will likely result in earnings per diluted share of $3.70. This indicates net sales and earnings per diluted share growth of 8% and 9%, respectively, from the 2022 guided figures of $1.025 billion (net sales) and $3.40 (earnings per diluted share). Excluding certain one-time items, management is likely to expect 12% earnings per diluted share growth in 2023.Inter Parfums is likely to expect growth in 2023, driven by its solid brand portfolio and global distribution network. Further, sales growth will likely be backed by product launches. Management expects to gain from sustained travel retail business growth, a more streamlined supply-chain structure and modest pricing actions (which are likely to be undertaken in 2023 beginning).Story continuesStrategic Partnerships Hold PromiseInter Parfums is on track to expand its business through new licenses or acquisitions. Recently, its majority-owned Paris-based subsidiary, Interparfums SA, signed a license agreement with Lacoste — a well-known fashion sports brand. Both parties have entered a worldwide exclusive 15-year fragrance license agreement, effective Jan 1, 2024. The company is optimistic about the partnership with well-established fragrance brands like Donna Karan and DKNY.In December 2021, Inter Parfums, through its subsidiary Interparfums Italia signed a 10-year exclusive global licensing agreement with Emanuel Ungaro. In October 2021, Inter Parfums finalized the agreement with Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A. Per the agreement, Inter Parfums holds the exclusive worldwide license for the production and distribution of Salvatore Ferragamo brand perfumes.Product Launches on TrackInter Parfums is well-positioned to cater to elevated demand in the fragrance space. During 2022, the company introduced several scents, namely Montblanc Legend Red, CoachWild Rose, Coach Dreams Sunset, Coach Open Road, GUESS Uomo and Kate Spade Sparkle, among others. The company also launched brand extensions and flankers for several brands. In addition, the company unveiled Moncler’s debut scents at the beginning of 2022.For the next year, the company’s new product pipeline for U.S. brands consists of new pillars for the Hollister and MCM brands. The product pipeline is dominated by brand extensions and flankers. Management is on track with major launches for Ferragamo, Donna Karan and DKNY brands for 2024. In European operations, the company will launch a new fragrance for Kate Spade in 2023.Certainly, focusing on effective product launches along with the aforementioned upsides will keep IPAR in investors’ good books.3 Solid Staple PicksSome other top-ranked stocks are Conagra Brands CAG, Campbell Soup CPB and Mondelez International, Inc.

With 65% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$15b. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 50% for shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell NVIDIA, which might have negative implications on individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of NVIDIA. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in NVIDIA. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in NVIDIA. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.3% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.2% and 5.5% of the stock. In addition, we found that Jen-Hsun Huang, the CEO has 3.5% of the shares allocated to their name.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of NVIDIAThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.We can see that insiders own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$15b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 31% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand NVIDIA better, we need to consider many other factors.

This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 3.63% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.59% in that time.Nvidia will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Nvidia is projected to report earnings of $0.81 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 38.64%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $6.02 billion, down 21.26% from the year-ago period.NVDA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.27 per share and revenue of $26.94 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -26.35% and +0.1%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently.

This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 13.41.Meanwhile, NVDA's PEG ratio is currently 3.72.

Today, we have Nvidia, Tesla, and Amazon. My pick is Nvidia, which reached a peak market cap not this year, but last year of $834 billion. It is ending the year at $359 billion. That is a drop of over $475 billion, or 57%. And not a lot of fun-- well, we do have a lot of fundamental news, but I want to get to our heat maps here and just show some technical analysis on a sector basis.So here we have the year-to-date view. Lots of dark red. Pretty ugly there. Nvidia, by the way, in the lower left. That's down over 50%. And let me sort by performance. You can see the bottom row there. Intel down a very similar amount, almost 50%. It looks like Western Digital, AMD, Marvell, all of those significant losses here.Now, if you look at the quarter, we do see some green. But the month of December was pretty negative for chip stocks. They are very cyclical, very levered to the business economy here. And any bad news with respect to the Fed still hiking, anything with regard to persistent inflation, well, that weighs on this sector. You can see only AVGO, that's Broadcom in the upper left, that's up about 9/10 of a perfect for us.- Yeah, Jared. We had a guest on this week on chips and stuff and talking about how the boom-bust nature of the business, it's such a commodity. They overproduced, then they have too much supply. Nvidia is a different story because it's really kind of these high-value graphics chips that people really want. So maybe if these people-- or, sorry, businesses go through that supply, and then replenish later in the year, maybe they might be in a better spot. I mean, it's still a very expensive business to be in.- Yeah, it certainly is very expensive. And we've heard a number of the projections that have come out, not only from analysts but a number of industry watchers. Gartner out with a recent forecast saying that the global semiconductor revenue is projected to decline 3.6% next year. So I know a number of analysts are bullish on the sector, but a lot of that has to do with picking the right winners in this space, given the fact that there's so much uncertainty headed into the new year.- Yeah.]"

You can skip our outlook and go directly to the 5 Best 52-Week Low Large Cap Stocks to Buy Now.Large cap stocks, also known as ""blue chip"" stocks, are stocks of well-established companies that have a long track record of financial stability and strong performance. Some investors may consider buying large capitalization stocks because they are seen as a safer investment with a lower level of risk compared to smaller or newer companies.All in all, 2022 has been a rather bad year for investors. Inflation and interest rates have been the two main market drivers that have weighed on stocks throughout 2022. In 2022 alone, investors in the mutual funds invested in US equities lost about 19% on average. The FED’s monetary tightening has weighed on equity valuations, and the central bank has shown no sign of pivot as of yet.Although the outlook may appear grim, there is some respite for long-term investors in that this may be an excellent time to buy equities. The stock market as a whole has recovered from every previous bear market in history and gone on to establish new all-time highs. The good thing about a bear market is that investors get to pick solid companies at cheap valuations, which is a luxury they don’t get in bull cycles. Hence, in this article, we are going to talk about some large cap companies whose stocks have been hammered in 2022, which may be a good buy for long-term holding.The 52-week low is the lowest price at which a stock has traded over the past 52 weeks. It is a commonly used benchmark for investors to gauge the performance of a particular stock or to compare the performance of multiple stocks. The 52-week low can be an indicator of potential buying opportunities, as the stock may be undervalued based on its recent performance. In this article, we are going to talk about some large cap companies that are hovering around their 52-week lows, hence trading on an attractive valuation as compared to a year before.Story continuesOur MethodologyWe identified mega cap stocks that lost at least 35% year-to-date that are near their 52-week lows and ranked them using Insider Monkey's proprietary hedge fund sentiment index.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Biggest Stocks that Benefit from Rising Interest Rates.The US Federal Reserve has increased the benchmark interest rates to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% in December 2022. This is the highest benchmark interest rate since December 2007. The move has been made to combat raging inflation that reached a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022 and recorded an increase of 7.1% YoY in November 2022. The Federal Reserve has warned of further interest rate hikes in 2023 and has provided a median benchmark interest rate guidance of 5.1% for the next year. The increase in the benchmark interest rates is expected to tighten the economy and bring inflation back to the Federal Reserve’s long-term target of 2%.The developments related to interest rate changes require close attention from investors. In circumstances where interest rates are on the rise and the economy is showing signs of improvement, numerous opportunities rise in the world of equities. According to a top adviser to the president, the White House is confident that the US economy can still achieve a “soft landing” as the significant public investments made by Joe Biden will provide support to the job market in the coming months. Despite the Fed Reserve’s monetary tightening in full force over the previous three months, the US labor market outperformed expectations and posted an average monthly job increase of 272,000.Certain businesses, such as those belonging to the financial sector, are likely to experience a tailwind as an increase in interest rates results in higher profit margins. Meanwhile, brokerage institutions start to experience an increase in trading activity as the economy starts to recover and also experience higher interest income due to surging interest rates. However, this does not mean that investors should remain restricted to the financial sector only. Retailers and consumer companies also experience positive momentum as the economy starts to recover. Companies such as  JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) are amongst some of the biggest stocks that stand to benefit from rising interest rates.Story continues12 Biggest Stocks that Benefit from Rising Interest RatesPhoto by Nicholas Cappello on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have analyzed the business models of numerous companies to assess the impact of the rising interest rates on their financial strength and growth plans. According to experts, the majority of the companies that are expected to benefit from rising interest rates belong to the financial sector. The financial sector companies shortlisted have a strong global presence and offer expansive wealth management and investment banking services. Rising interest rates are expected to boost their profit margins in the coming quarters. Furthermore, we have also included some leading names from the consumer goods and home improvement retail sector. These stocks have been ranked according to the hedge fund sentiment as of Q3 2022.12 Biggest Stocks that Benefit from Rising Interest Rates12. Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) is a Cottonwood Heights, Utah-based real estate investment trust (REIT) founded in 1977 that is focused on investing in self-storage units.Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) carries a significant amount of debt as it buys self-storage properties on mortgages. However, around 62% of the company’s total debt is on a fixed interest rate of 3.2% only as of Q3 2022. This will play in favor of Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) during a period of rising interest rates, as the company will observe significant savings on financing costs. In a research report released on December 5, Ki Bin Kim at Truist assigned Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) stock a target price of $175 and reiterated a Buy rating following the Q3 2022 results and the recent developments taking place in the self-storage REIT industry.Baron Funds shared its stance on Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Following a sharp correction in its share price during the second quarter, we acquired shares in Extra Space Storage Inc. This REIT has assembled the second-largest self-storage portfolio in the country and has the largest portfolio of third-party managed self-storage facilities. In our opinion, Extra Space’s management team is excellent. Over the last decade, management has delivered strong occupancy gains, rent growth, and expense control that has led to a cost of capital advantage relative to its peers. Management has capitalized on its cost of capital advantage by tripling its owned self-storage count since 2010. We believe the long-term growth opportunity for the company remains strong.”11. Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS) is a Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based operator of departmental store chains across the US.

(NYSE:TRV) is a New York-based insurance company that has the distinction of being the second biggest underwriter of US commercial property and casualty insurance.The company, founded in 1853, is the sixth-biggest underwriter in the field of personal insurance through its vast network of independent agents. The relationship between rising benchmark interest rates and the growth of insurance companies is positive as portfolio yields increase in tandem with appropriate rate increases.

(NYSE:TRV) stock has observed an increase of over 21% since the start of 2022.Millennium Management increased its stake in The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) by 100% during Q3 2022.9.

Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) is a Findlay, Ohio-based refining, marketing, and transportation provider of petroleum products.The company is expected to save significantly during the rising interest rate environment due to its low debt levels. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) has been lowering its debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio since March 2020. Experts anticipate Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) to have a strong 2023 as the refining market is expected to remain under pressure due to supply-related limitations that would support a high-margin environment like 2022. For the recently ended quarter, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) increased its dividend by about 30%. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) strives to have each of its assets produce free cash flow for the company and increase returns to shareholders.As of Q3 2022, Paul Singer’s Elliot Management was the biggest hedge fund holder of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) stock, with a stake of over $1 billion.Here’s what Clark Street Value said about Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“During the worst of covid, I bought some LEAPs on Marathon Petroleum (MPC) as a proxy for Par Pacific (PARR) since long dated options weren’t available on the later.  Those MPC calls expire next month and I’ll take profits, with PARR I’ve reduced my position throughout the year and might sell the rest early next year, I’ve owned it for 6-7 years and it has gone nowhere, they haven’t touched the NOLs, just a difficult business that I probably don’t understand as well as I should.”7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an Issaquah, Washington-based operator of membership-only big-box retail stores.The strong membership model operated by the company is insulated from the volatility in the discretionary retail sector due to rising interest rates and inflation. There are strong expectations that increasing interest rates and high inflation will increase membership rates as consumers look to benefit from discounts. Furthermore, numerous members are now becoming executive members, who must pay a double membership fee in exchange for an extra 2% discount while shopping at Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST).On December 21, Ivan Feinseth at Tigress Financial gave Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock a target price of $635, along with a Buy rating. The analyst highlighted the recent dip in the stock price as an attractive buying opportunity for investors.Here’s what Cooper Investors said about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”6. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a New York-based investment bank and a diversified financial services company.The company is preparing itself to benefit from a rising interest rate environment by broadening its partnership with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Unlike other banks, Goldman Sachs has agreed to provide customers the option to view their deposit account balances on their digital wallets. Furthermore, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is working with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to develop high-yielding savings account along with a buy now pay later (BNPL) plan that would be exclusively available to customers of Apple. This reflects The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (NYSE:GS) intention to provide consumer banking services through the digital medium without opting for full-fledged physical operations.ClearBridge Investments discussed its stance on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We also initiated a new position in The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), which is trading far below what we would expect of a well-capitalized financials stock capable of generating an attractive return on equity over a market cycle. The company’s prospects are further enhanced by strong market share gains and further buildout of its fintech consumer finance initiatives.Additionally, its earnings appear to have stabilized from the peak deal activity and inflated asset valuations of the last market cycle. While we acknowledge that a full-blown recession would put pressure on these earnings, Goldman Sachs has a history of capitalizing on downcycles to solidify its leading investment and trading businesses.”In addition to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) are also on our list of the biggest stocks that benefit from rising interest rates.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Biggest Stocks that Benefit from Rising Interest Rates. Suggested articles:20 Countries with the biggest coal reserves11 Best Defensive Defense Stocks To Buy12 Best Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy For BeginnersDisclosure: None. 12 Biggest Stocks that Benefit from Rising Interest Rates is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Though all three major bourses are in deep red, the Dow Jones fared as the best index, declining 8.6%. The S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 19.2% and 33%, respectively.While less than half of the stocks in the blue-chip index are in green, five have gained in double digits and remain the hottest throughout the year. These include Chevron CVX, Merck &amp; Co. MRK, The Travelers Companies Inc. TRV, Amgen AMGN and Caterpillar CAT.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, aggressive Fed rate hikes and global growth concerns have roiled the stock market badly. Additionally, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China has slowed down economic activities across the country.The Fed has been on an aggressive tightening spree for more than decades. Fed Chair Jerome Powell raised interest rates for the seventh time this year, taking the benchmark rate to the range of 3.75% and 4.00% — the highest level since 2008. The increase in interest rates has made borrowing expensive, pushed up the cost of buying a new car or house, increased the cost of carrying credit card debt and thus heightened the risk of a recession.However, the latest bouts of data, including easing consumer prices, rising consumer confidence, a solid job report, and strong manufacturing activity, suggest that a large part of the economy remains resilient. Oil prices have been rising on tightening supply and higher demand conditions.The outperformance of the blue-chip index came as it has significant exposure to cyclical sectors like energy, industrials and financials. These sectors have performed well this year. Energy is the top sector of 2022 driven by higher oil price, industrials has gained strength on improving manufacturing and industrial activities, while the financial sector got a boost from rate hikes.Best Stocks of DowChevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world, with operations that span almost every corner of the globe.

Although jobs in this career are in high-demand and will be a key piece of our sustainability, according to the National Science Board, fewer than 50% of minorities are in the STEM labor force.As a global power technology leader, Cummins Inc. is working to increase the exposure of STEM careers to minorities and women across the world through various programs and initiatives. In fact, through the CARE initiative, the company held a special STEM activity at multiple sites in the U.S. during the month of November to celebrate National STEM Day.CARE sponsored Lego engine builds for local high school students in Atlanta and Detroit, and has STEM activities scheduled for students in other CARE cities in 2023. The participating youth built Cummins engines out of Lego bricks; for many, this was their first exposure to the world of science, technology, engineering and math.""To celebrate National STEM Day we wanted to introduce and support students on their STEM journey in our targeted CARE communities,"" said Delilah Morgan, Cummins Director of External Diversity Initiatives. ""The data is clear; minorities are underrepresented in STEM fields, and we know a large reason is lack of exposure to STEM careers. A core value of Cummins is diversity and inclusion, and our company believes our diversity of thought helps position us as a global technology leader. We believe investing in our youth today is a direct deposit into the planet's future.""The international comparisons fueled discussion of U.S. education and workforce needs. The bipartisan congressional STEM Education Caucus noted: ""Our knowledge-based economy is driven by constant innovation. The foundation of innovation lies in a dynamic, motivated and well-educated workforce equipped with STEM skills.""Story continuesNational STEM Day began as a result of studies in the early 2000s revealed U.S. students were not achieving in the STEM disciplines at the same rates as students in other countries. The report predicted dire consequences if the U.S. could not compete in the global economy due to a poorly prepared workforce. Thus, educators focused on science, math, and technology research, on economic policy and on education. U.S. prosperity seemed to depend on it.Growth in America's STEM jobs in the first decade of the 21st century tripled the rate of growth in non-STEM jobs. However, racial and gender gaps remained a problem.

(TRC) has made an unsolicited mini-tender offer to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of Disney common stock, and, per a press release issued by TRC on December 28, 2022 (the TRC Press Release), has amended the terms of such offer to decrease the offer price payable to $85.00 a share, down from a prior offer price of $89.15 a share.Disney recommends that shareholders not tender their shares in response to TRC’s unsolicited offer because the offer price of $85.00 per share is below the current market price for Disney shares. This means that, based on today’s closing market price, Disney shareholders who tender their shares in the offer will receive a below-market price.Disney is not affiliated or associated in any way with TRC, its mini-tender offer or the offer documentation. TRC has made similar mini-tender offers for shares of other companies. Mini-tender offers seek to acquire not more than 5 percent of a company’s shares outstanding, thereby avoiding many disclosure and procedural requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") that are designed to protect investors. As a result, mini-tender offers do not provide investors with the same level of protection as provided by larger tender offers under United States federal securities laws.The SEC has cautioned investors that some bidders making mini-tender offers are ""betting that the market price will rise before the offer closes and then extending the offer until it does or improperly canceling if it doesn’t."" The SEC has provided guidance to investors on mini-tender offers at www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm.Disney urges investors to obtain current market quotations for their shares, consult with their broker or financial advisor and exercise caution with respect to TRC’s offer. Disney recommends that shareholders who have not responded to TRC’s offer take no action. Shareholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw them in accordance with the terms included in TRC’s offering documents. Per the TRC Press Release, the offer is scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m. New York City time on Thursday, January 12, 2023, unless extended. TRC reported that as of the close of business on Tuesday, December 27, 2022, no shares had been tendered.Story continuesDisney requests that a copy of this news release be included with all distributions of materials relating to TRC’s mini-tender offer related to shares of Disney common stock.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221230005235/en/ContactsDavid JeffersonCorporate Communications(818) 560-4832david.j.jefferson@disney.comMike LongCorporate Communications(818) 560-4588mike.p.long@disney.comAlexia QuadraniInvestor Relations(818) 560-6601alexia.quadrani@disney.com]"

Apple TV+, at an affordable $4.99, is benefiting from quality content with its strong portfolio of original shows and movies. This is expected to increase competition for Comcast’s Peacock and video businesses.However, Peacock is well-poised to grow, owing to its vast library of IPs and new productions. The recovery in the park and movie business bodes well for Comcast’s prospects.The Theme Park business has been on a recovery path this year, with revenues jumping 71.6% to $5.43 billion year to date. A growing admission rate in its theme parks is expected to drive top-line growth.The launch of Super Nintendo World in Japan, the Velocicoaster in Orlando and Secret Life of Pets in Hollywood are noteworthy.

Let's take a look at some hot Yahoo Finance tickers on this Friday before New Year's Eve, starting with Beyond Meat, the plant-based meat company in focus this morning after announcing a new menu offering at McDonald's in the UK and Ireland called the Double McPlant-- yes, the Double McPlant-- which will be unveiled January 4th. And it's been a tough year for Beyond Meat. The losses have piled up. But this is a nice, I would say, win for them to end this year.I know it's been really-- a point of focus by Beyond Meat founder and CEO Ethan Brown to get more offerings inside of McDonald's. He's been at this for so many years, trying to make this happen. So hats to him for getting that done at least. The Double McPlant-- social media seems to be excited about it. But, again, a challenging year for this company. It will be interesting to see how they come out of the gate in the first 1/2 of next year and if they can start getting things back on track.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, more plant patty, less fatty. I mean, at the end of the day, it's two lines of businesses that Beyond Meat has-- it's the refrigerator and the retail side that they're trying to get into. And then there's the restaurant side. And the restaurant side really accounts for-- or, at least prior to the pandemic, accounted for so much of their growth prior to everyone needing to hunker down and fill up the freezer, fill up the refrigerator, perhaps get some new alternative meats within there as well for their diet.And I think that's where Beyond Meat really had to shift their strategy-- thrust forward some of the capital spend in terms of its own operations so they weren't leasing out space but instead owning the space that they were manufacturing in. And that pulls forward a lot of the capital expenditure and the costs associated. And so now, with that new facility that they do have, it's about, OK, where can we continue to drum up some of-- on the pilot basis, where we've already had certain partners-- more long-term partnerships-- to have our plant patty on the menu.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: What was that? Double patty, less fatty?[LAUGHTER]That's really good. No, but they have gained a lot of distribution that I would argue is not reflected in Beyond Meat's stock. I picked up a package of frozen Beyond Meat meatballs at CVS last night for dinner.BRAD SMITH: Oh, yeah?BRIAN SOZZI: I was surprised to see them at CVS. And then I went back and remembered, oh, yes, they signed a distribution agreement with the company. That was the only meat product available at my local CVS, and I ate the whole package again.BRAD SMITH: Have you compared them side-by-side-- like, Beyond Meat versus Impossible Foods?BRIAN SOZZI: I'm a Beyond guy--BRAD SMITH: Yeah?BRIAN SOZZI: --through and through.BRAD SMITH: OK.BRIAN SOZZI: That's just how I live.BRAD SMITH: But it's more expensive, and that's the other thing too.BRIAN SOZZI: It cost me $8 for my meatballs.BRAD SMITH: Right. So that's the more expensive option that's gonna be on the menu for a lot of customers.BRIAN SOZZI: I'm bougie. $8 for meatballs-- I'm good. I'm good.BRAD SMITH: Well, Brad and non-bougie over here is gonna be walking into McDonald's looking for a value menu when the recession hits. And I'm gonna be saying, OK, let me get the dollar fries. Or let me get, you know, this value package. And is the McPlant-- the Double McPlant-- excuse me-- gonna be on that?BRIAN SOZZI: But you're getting a double patty that's less fatty, Brad. You said it, not me. You're bringing this stuff, man. I didn't say that. That looks delicious. I'd pay a little more for that. That looks great.BRAD SMITH: The real question is whether or not it'll make it to the metaverse at some point like Chipotle has made it into.]"

And Why You Should Too.,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-big-investors-betting-rivn-154138027.html,1672155698,STORY,"['RIVN', 'TROW', 'AMZN']","[Practically the entire year of 2022 was a bear raid on electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN), it seems. It’s been one problem after another for RIVN stock investors, but don’t fret. While the bears are out in full force, there are also some well-heeled investors wagering that Rivian can, sooner or later, provide value to the shareholders.If it’s any comfort to Rivian’s shareholders, growth stocks have generally lost value this year. The enthusiasm that swept EV stocks to fresh highs in 2021 quickly dissipated as financial traders crowded into defensive assets.It certainly didn’t help the bullish thesis for Rivian when one famous hedge fund manager expressed his not-so-optimistic stance on the equities markets. Still, this could provide an attractive entry point for Rivian Automotive’s loyal investors — which, by the way, include some sizable financial institutions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBroad-Market Jitters Put Pressure on RIVN StockRIVN stock fell from over $100 to less than $20 in 2022 — a horrifying drop for traders with weak stomachs. This occurred even though Rivian worked diligently to fulfill its objective of delivering 25,000 vehicles this year.Is it possible, then, that investors are panic-selling Rivian shares simply due to fears of a broad-market selloff? It’s a theory to consider, as Appaloosa Management founder and President David Tepper unleashed a verbal salvo on an already reeling equities market recently.This took place on Dec. 22, and RIVN stock dropped 6.18% that day even though there wasn’t any specific news about Rivian. It’s an indication that investors are punishing growth stocks and EV stocks generally, and Rivian is just collateral damage.Indeed, many traders freaked out when Tepper warned that he’s leaning “short on the equity markets.” Sure, interest rate hikes could continue to take a toll on stocks next year; this point is duly noted. Yet, EV industry enthusiasts and Rivian bulls don’t have to throw in the towel. In fact, they should be encouraged, as some financial whales are actually long and strong on Rivian.Story continues5 Investors Betting Big on RIVN StockDespite Tepper’s concerns about the stock market, Rivian continues to have a number of big-money backers. So, let’s take a look at some of Rivian Automotive’s top institutional investors as of Sept. 29, 2022.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN): A massive position of 158.36 million RIVN shares, as the e-commerce giant holds 17.34% of Rivian’s outstanding shares.T Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW): 140.63 million Rivian Automotive shares, or 15.4% of the outstanding shares.BlackRock (NYSE:BLK): 46.56 million shares, which translates to 5.1% of outstanding RIVN shares.Capital Research Global Investors: A long position consisting of 43.38 million Rivian shares, or 4.75% of the automaker’s outstanding shares.Vanguard: A stake of 36.24 million RIVN shares, which represents 3.97% of the outstanding shares.Join the EV Revolution With High-Powered InvestorsRivian Automotive, and the EV industry overall, have both fans and detractors. If you’re a believer, then you don’t have to let Tepper’s talk scare you. After all, the vehicle electrification movement isn’t going to stall out anytime soon.Instead of panicking, consider joining Amazon, BlackRock, Vanguard and other market movers by taking a stake in Rivian. Sooner or later — and with or without the perma-bears’ permission — your shares of RIVN stock should appreciate.On the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.David Moadel has provided compelling content – and crossed the occasional line – on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

The Finance sector rose 2.5% but the S&amp;P 500 composite index dipped 1% in the same time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFavorable Style ScoreAXP is positioned well for progress, evident by its VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of all three factors.Positive Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has moved 0.5% north in the past 30 days.Impressive Earnings Surprise HistoryAmerican Express’ earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 11.33%.Solid Return on EquityThe return in equity of AXP was at 33.3% as of Sep 30, 2022, way higher than the industry figure of 19.9%. This reflects its efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds.Business TailwindsDiscount revenues of American Express, which account for a major chunk of its top line, are expected to grow on the back of improved network volumes. Its network volumes continue to be driven by the global economic recovery from the adverse impacts of the COVID- pandemic, which signals the scope for better Card Member spending.Further, AXP’s discount revenues also benefit from growing travel and entertainment (T&amp;E)-related volumes. Increased confidence in traveling due to the easing of the pandemic-linked restrictions will continue providing an impetus to the T&amp;E-related volumes in the days ahead.For 2022, American Express expects revenue growth in the range of 23-25%. The top line witnessed 17% year-over-year growth in 2021. Management anticipates the bottom line to cross its initial 2022 earnings per share guidance of $9.25-$9.65 this year.Story continuesThe company continues to roll out innovative card offerings and upgrade the existing ones with benefits, marking its continuous efforts to invest in customer acquisition, engagement and retention initiatives. In an evolving digital era, AXP has put its best foot forward to build an advanced digital solutions suite. This, in turn, continues to play a vital role in bolstering the customer base of American Express.Simultaneously, with the launch of digital payment solutions, AXP also has effective fraud prevention services in place that have been developed with the help of partnerships and investments. In December 2022, it launched Amex Business Link to enable its network participants to extend seamless business-to-business (B2B) payments to their business clients, thus saving time and costs.A strong financial position backed by growing cash reserves and robust cash-generating abilities has paved the way for American Express to undertake significant business investments and tactically deploy capital either through share buybacks or dividend payments.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Finance space are Amalgamated Financial Corp.

(NYSE:ZBH)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-zimmer-biomet-holdings-inc-132830642.html,1672406910,STORY,['ZBH'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH). The company's stock saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Zimmer Biomet Holdings’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Zimmer Biomet Holdings What's The Opportunity In Zimmer Biomet Holdings?According to my valuation model, Zimmer Biomet Holdings seems to be fairly priced at around 13% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Zimmer Biomet Holdings today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $146.72, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Zimmer Biomet Holdings’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Zimmer Biomet Holdings look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Zimmer Biomet Holdings. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ZBH’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ZBH, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Zimmer Biomet Holdings at this point in time.

BGS appears in troubled shape as the company has been battling major cost hurdles, which are likely to persist. On its last earnings call, management lowered its adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal 2022.Shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have slumped 53.6% in the past six months against the industry’s growth of 5.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal 2023 EPS has declined from $1 to 96 cents per share in the past seven days.B&amp;G Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseB&amp;G Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseB&amp;G Foods, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | B&amp;G Foods, Inc. QuoteCost Inflation PersistsIn the third quarter of 2022, B&amp;G Foods’ adjusted gross profit of $108 million declined 11.9% year over year from $122.6 million in the year-ago period. The adjusted gross margin contracted 340 basis points (bps) to 20.4%. The gross margin was hurt by greater-than-anticipated input cost inflation. This includes escalated raw materials and transportation expenses.BGS expects the input cost inflation to bear a significant impact industry-wide for the remainder of fiscal 2022 and in fiscal 2023. It anticipates significant cost inflation for inputs, such as ingredients, packaging, labor and transportation, to continue based on factors like the pandemic, the Ukraine war, weather conditions, supply-chain hurdles and the shortage of labor. In fiscal 2023, the company expects inflation of 4-5%.Low Q3 Earnings &amp; Narrowed GuidanceB&amp;G Foods posted adjusted earnings of 31 cents per share, which declined 43.6% from the year-ago quarter. The downside was a result of industry-wide inflation in input costs and supply-chain bottlenecks, together with the impact of stock worth $6.5 million sold by the company via an at-the-market equity offering program.The company lowered its adjusted EBITDA view for fiscal 2022 to the $290-$300 million range compared with the $300-$320 million band mentioned earlier, whereas it reported $358 million in fiscal 2021. The adjusted EPS in fiscal 2022 is envisioned to be 90 cents to $1.00 versus the $1.08-$1.28 band stated before. In fiscal 2021, the company reported an EPS of $1.88.Story continuesWrapping UpB&amp;G Foods is on track to mitigate the impacts of inflation on the gross margin by undertaking cost-saving initiatives, increasing list prices and locking in prices via short-term supply contracts and advance commodities purchase agreements. That said, the abovementioned headwinds cannot be ignored, at least in the near term.3 Food Stocks to GrabSome better-ranked stocks are Mondelez International MDLZ, Campbell Soup CPB and Conagra Brands CAG.Mondelez, which manufactures, markets and sells snack food and beverage products, currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

IPAR. The provider of fragrances and related products is benefiting from solid brand performance.These abovementioned upsides have boosted third-quarter 2022 results, with the top and bottom lines increasing year over year. The solid performance prompted management to raise its 2022 view. Impressively, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s stock has rallied 28.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 8.4% growth.Let’s discuss this in detail.Brand Strength Boosts GrowthIn the third quarter of 2022, Inter Parfums’ U.S.-based product sales amounted to $82 million, increasing 45% year over year. In the company’s U.S. operations, new brands like Ferragamo, Donna Karan and DKNY generated 41% of the gains. Apart from this, organic growth from established brands like GUESS, Oscar de la Renta, Hollister and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch also contributed to the upside.Quarterly sales of its European operations increased 12% in euros, with the three largest brands, Montblanc, Jimmy Choo and Coach, outperforming by 11%, 32% and 3% year over year, respectively. Several mid-sized brands, namely Kate Spade, Rochas, Boucheron, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels and Karl Lagerfeld, also witnessed comparable quarter sales growth. That being said, a 17% decline in the average euro-to-dollar exchange rate masked such an upside resulting in a 4% drop in the quarterly European-based product sales in dollars.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBright ViewThe company is optimistic about its business prospects and continues investing to gain market share and long-term growth. Management now expects 2022 net sales of $1.025 billion, up from previous guidance of $1 billion. Earnings per share are anticipated to come in at $3.40, higher than the earlier guidance of $3.25.For 2023, management anticipates net sales of $1.11 billion, which will likely result in earnings per diluted share of $3.70. This indicates net sales and earnings per diluted share growth of 8% and 9%, respectively, from the 2022 guided figures of $1.025 billion (net sales) and $3.40 (earnings per diluted share). Excluding certain one-time items, management is likely to expect 12% earnings per diluted share growth in 2023.Inter Parfums is likely to expect growth in 2023, driven by its solid brand portfolio and global distribution network.

We're about eight minutes into today's trading session. Let's get on over to Jared Blikre at the YFi Interactive for a deeper dive into today's tape this morning.JARED BLIKRE: Yes. Well, we got to talk about the energy market because, as you were just working your magic there over at the YFi Interactive, I'm going to go back to the year-to-date look at our sectors. Energy, the only thing in the green, and it is green by a mile, up 57%.And XLE-- let me just show you a max chart on this. This is going to go back to-- it's going to go back to the late 90s. Arguably, this is a triple top from the global financial crisis to 2013 and then into this year until XLE crosses this hurdle here. And this is roughly 90 to about 110, 120. This is still potentially, incredibly strong resistance. So I just want to throw that out there now.But let's go back to-- let's actually go to our futures chart here where we see crude oil. That's up about 4%. Brent's up 4.3%. So we'll take a look at WTI. Here is a year-to-date chart of crude. And what stands out to me is it's only up 4%. So basically, crude oil round-tripped its entire gains.Now this big spike here in February, March, that was the Russia-Ukraine conflict as it was erupting. That was just kind of out of the blue. And, of course, more of that could emerge in the new year. Then we had this second spurt up to about 120. And it's been a slow, steady decline ever since. And OPEC Plus just, at their last meeting earlier in the month, they left everything the same. So they seem to be happy with the way things are-- maybe an equilibrium level in the oil market right now.So this is our energy stock heat map. And we can see Exxon, the biggest of the majors. That's up 79%-- huge gains for any kind of company. But number one here is OXY. I believe that's number one. And here is the year-to-date chart on this. At 115%-- by the way, this is the energy stock that Warren Buffett likes the most. Berkshire Hathaway has a huge position there. It's been rumored they might buy the company.To be able to consolidate these gains as we are having the worst year in years for stocks overall is incredibly powerful. But much like some of these other markets, at potential resistance as well. So long-term charts are saying we could be at resistance. But there's huge gains that we have made this year in some of these markets.- Jared Blikre with the technical analysis. Appreciate it.]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned -9.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.6% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, to which Occidental belongs, has lost 6.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Occidental is expected to post earnings of $1.93 per share, indicating a change of +30.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.68 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +279.6%. This estimate has changed -1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.23 indicates a change of -25.2% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Occidental.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Occidental, the consensus sales estimate of $8.93 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.5%. The $37.52 billion and $33.75 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +42.6% and -10.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $9.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +39.4%. EPS of $2.44 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.35 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.58%. The EPS surprise was -1.61%.Over the last four quarters, Occidental surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is quite evident from the fiscal 2023 budget proposal worth $773 billion put forward by the Biden administration for the Department of Defense, with $56.5 billion planned investments in combat aircraft. Impressively, the defense budget request reflects a 4.1% increase from the fiscal 2022 enacted amount.Such solid budgetary provisions should benefit Lockheed and defense manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Boeing BA and Textron TXT, which also have expertise in manufacturing military aircraft.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat.

You can skip our outlook and go directly to the 5 Best 52-Week Low Large Cap Stocks to Buy Now.Large cap stocks, also known as ""blue chip"" stocks, are stocks of well-established companies that have a long track record of financial stability and strong performance. Some investors may consider buying large capitalization stocks because they are seen as a safer investment with a lower level of risk compared to smaller or newer companies.All in all, 2022 has been a rather bad year for investors. Inflation and interest rates have been the two main market drivers that have weighed on stocks throughout 2022. In 2022 alone, investors in the mutual funds invested in US equities lost about 19% on average. The FED’s monetary tightening has weighed on equity valuations, and the central bank has shown no sign of pivot as of yet.Although the outlook may appear grim, there is some respite for long-term investors in that this may be an excellent time to buy equities. The stock market as a whole has recovered from every previous bear market in history and gone on to establish new all-time highs. The good thing about a bear market is that investors get to pick solid companies at cheap valuations, which is a luxury they don’t get in bull cycles. Hence, in this article, we are going to talk about some large cap companies whose stocks have been hammered in 2022, which may be a good buy for long-term holding.The 52-week low is the lowest price at which a stock has traded over the past 52 weeks. It is a commonly used benchmark for investors to gauge the performance of a particular stock or to compare the performance of multiple stocks. The 52-week low can be an indicator of potential buying opportunities, as the stock may be undervalued based on its recent performance. In this article, we are going to talk about some large cap companies that are hovering around their 52-week lows, hence trading on an attractive valuation as compared to a year before.Story continuesOur MethodologyWe identified mega cap stocks that lost at least 35% year-to-date that are near their 52-week lows and ranked them using Insider Monkey's proprietary hedge fund sentiment index. Basically, our article lists the best 52-week low stocks to buy according to hedge funds. We sorted the stocks by their YTD returns.

With artful research and creative financial strategies, many investors can find stocks that will bring impressive returns and provide plenty of financial security.Take the time to understand a company’s financial statements, management decisions and goals before investing if you want maximum bang for your buck. It is vital to do so at this time, considering the bear market we experienced this year.Bank stocks took a hard hit after an encouraging 2021. One issue is that banks are closely tied to the conflict in Ukraine. In response to the crisis, loan growth has slowed down. Additionally, stock prices overall have been on a free fall since the start of 2022. Although the markets may seem unpredictable, bank stocks remain undervalued. The Federal Reserve is set to increase interest rates to meet its inflation goal of 2%, which sets up banks for increased earnings.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTo help you stay informed and prepared, we have a hand-selected mix of the best financial stocks to buy in 2023 that should not be overlooked. By thoroughly researching these options, you can play it safe while potentially earning impressive returns in an uncertain future market. Below is our list of the ten best financial stocks to buy in 2023.TOSTToast$17.15SOFISoFi Technologies$4.39INTUIntuit$383.11LMNDLemonade$13.41WFCWells Fargo$41.04CCitigroup$44.39FITBFifth Third Bancorp$32.80FRCFirst Republic Bank$119.68SBNYSignature Bank$113.98VVisa$206.29Toast (TOST)A close-up of a Toast (TOST) ordering screen.Source: TonelsonProductions / Shutterstock.comToast (NYSE:TOST) has developed a cloud solution for restaurants that helps them run their business smoothly. Due to the pandemic, it suffered through some of its worst years in 2020 and 2021. However, now things are getting back to normal, and recent financial results confirm this.Story continuesThe company’s numbers look promising, with a 55% rise in revenues year-over-year after Q3, and adjusted losses going down to $98 million from $254 million last year. The company also upgraded its outlook for the fourth quarter. Now, revenue is expected to be between $730 million and $760 million against a consensus analyst forecast of $725 million.However, this solid performance is not reflected in the markets. The stock is down over 50% in the year thus far. Investors are still cautious concerning the recovery of the restaurant market, which is reflected in Toast’s share price. However, in many countries, things are pretty normal. So, the stock can come back next year, making it one of the best financial stocks to buy. Shares are now being traded at a favorable price. If you’re thinking of investing in the next comeback story, now might be the right time to do so.SoFi Technologies (SOFI)An image of SoFi headquarters. SOFI stock.Source: Michael Vi / ShutterstockThis year, SoFi’s (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock price has taken a plunge. Shares are down more than 70% despite it being a great year for the fintech company. It completed the purchase of Golden Pacific Bancorp earlier this year, which means SoFi Technologies is now well and truly a bank. It no longer relies on third-party financial institutions to issue loans and provide deposit services. That puts it in a different league from other fintech players.In addition, SoFi’s personal loan business is increasingly profitable. According to recent reports, the success of that sector has allowed the firm to beat consensus expectations consistently. It also allows the online bank to circumvent the broader macroeconomic environment, despite mixed performance in other areas of its portfolio. This is great news for SoFi’s many customers and employees, who eagerly await the end of the student loan repayment pause to end.With its strong overall performance, SoFi appears to be on its way to a bright future. Furthermore, when the moratorium on student loan payments ends, SoFi will have back one of its best-performing segments. For these reasons, SoFi is one of the best financial stocks to buy.Intuit (INTU)Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) experienced impressive growth in the last fiscal year, with total revenue increasing by 32%, excluding the acquisition of email marketing provider MailChimp. It’s a testament to their business chops and financial acumen that they’ve come out on top in this difficult economic climate. Along with that comes premium stock prices. However, it’s for a good reason. Intuit remains competitive even when times are tough for its customers – small businesses and consumers who have been especially hard hit by current events.Intuit’s software tools have become indispensable resources, especially as belts are tightened amid an economic downturn. As a leader in tax software (Turbo Tax) and small business management solutions (QuickBooks, MailChimp), Intuit has been able to continue the positive trajectory of its small business segment. The performance comes despite budget cuts – with CFO Michelle Clatterbuck recently sharing the expectation that this sector will grow by an impressive 20% in fiscal 2023.From DIY-ers filing their taxes using Turbo Tax to businesses taking advantage of industry-leading fiscal solutions through QuickBooks and marketing assistance with MailChimp, Intuit possesses a robust operating model. Many of the segments are recession resistant. People need to manage their finances and file their returns. Growth in subscriber numbers might slow down for a couple of quarters. But the existing consumer base is incredibly sticky. The latest quarterly numbers show that revenue shot up 29%, despite a tough operating environment. That kind of performance is rare to find in the current market.Lemonade (LMND)Lemonade stock logo displayed on smartphone laying on top of computer keyboard.Source: Stephanie L Sanchez / Shutterstock.comLemonade’s (NYSE:LMND) entry into the insurance market is a major disruption to the industry – and with it comes great advantages for its technology and customers. Its use of machine learning provides the potential for a more accurate assessment of underwriting policies. It allows Lemonade to be competitive in pricing compared to traditional systems. Furthermore, the innovative approach has won them fans in the form of customers who enjoy their product and rave about their customer service. It is an advantage that takes time, investment and dedication to acquire. With these elements combined, Lemonade has placed itself as a major player in the market, ready for whatever may come next.Lemonade is proving its value by focusing on the in-force premium (IFP) as its top-line metric instead of revenue alone. The success in achieving high growth goals has resulted in a 76% increase in IFP since last year, with a 35% boost in premium per customer and a 30% jump in customer count. Moving forward, the company is committed to focusing on profitability. Despite the risk of utilizing machine learning to price policies, Lemonade is certain to offer an improved product. At the same time, it is consistently growing its market share.Lemonade has taken a similar turn as much of the tech industry, seeing a big fall in market cap this year. It’s trading at very attractive valuations and is worth keeping an eye on. Although it is a bit risky, it deserves a place on this list of financial stocks to buy because of its disruptive quality.Wells Fargo (WFC)Dividends Are the Best Reason to Hold Wells Fargo StockSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.comWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is one of the largest and most impressive banks in the United States. It offers an attractive risk-reward prospect for investors, making it an enticing option for those with high returns in mind.Wells Fargo has plans to make cost cutting a key focus area going into 2023 – this could be a major source of competitive differentiation between them and others. On top of this, the eventual abolition of its asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve presents another significant positive development. It can help attract more attention to the company come 2023.Wells Fargo &amp; Co. is slightly more attractive than other megabanks because it relies more on its consumer banking and lending arm than the investment banking business. It might not be by design, but the operating model for WFC is ideal in the current environment. In a turbulent economic climate, consumer banking has emerged as the saving grace for banks. While investment banking activity falters and markets continue to be bearish, people remain willing to take out loans with rising interest rates that generate much-needed income for financial institutions. Therefore, heading into 2023, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. is in a great position.Citigroup (C)The logo for Citigroup (C) can be seen on the side of an office building for the company.Source: Willy Barton / Shutterstock.comDespite a strong bearish market sentiment, now may be the time to take advantage of Citigroup’s (NYSE:C) underdog status. The current price offers significant upside potential regardless of what happens with Citi’s planned divestitures. The execution risk shouldn’t stop sophisticated investors willing to give them a chance and look past the recent roadblocks. It’s up to Citigroup to prove they have what it takes to get back on track, but the big payoff could be well worth it.Citigroup’s difficulties in 2022 reflect a challenging year of business operations. Unfortunately, its stock has plummeted close to 30%. Its value at the present low point has become a cause for further concern. The banking giant unveiled a multi-year transformation plan to improve its fortunes, yet the results were impaired due to several unforeseen obstacles encountered along the way. These delays were costly, allowing write-downs that affected contract invoicing and other financials. Moreover, Citigroup is contending with certain regulatory issues, while still operating under the looming threat of higher capital requirements.On the bright side, the investment bank is undergoing a major revamp of its consumer banking operations, setting the stage for an increasingly streamlined and profitable institution. By winding down or selling 14 international units – including Citibanamex in Mexico with remarkable returns – the bank will be able to hone in on core strengths such as investment banking, corporate banking and wealth management services. Making the business model more nimble is ideal, especially in a volatile market. It sets up Citigroup nicely for 2023 and beyond, sealing its fate among financial stocks to buy.Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB)Fifth Third Bank sign on brick buildingSource: Susan Montgomery / Shutterstock.comFifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) is an impressive regional bank with increasing reach, strong finances and impressive products. Their expanding presence in the Southeast region ensures more customers can access their high-quality banking services, which include retail and commercial banking, consumer lending and asset management. The bank’s solid footing also provides a great foundation for outperformance when market conditions become turbulent – as they always do.Furthermore, Fifth Third has seen improving credit quality over the past few years, which will protect them during an economic recession. The pandemic’s dramatic economic downturn left banks facing a critical test: evaluating and preparing for the heightened risk of loan defaults. At Fifth Third Bancorp, management shone under pressure. It did exceedingly well by accurately predicting potential losses while prudently setting aside reserves to cover them. The accomplishment is worthy of praise in uncertain times. That performance is carrying through even after the pandemic. Moreover, their technological advancements have not been appreciated by the market yet.All these factors make Fifth Third Bancorp a great choice for investors looking to buy financial stocks for long-term growth potential.First Republic Bank (FRC)A First Republic Bank branch in the Financial District of San Francisco, CaliforniaSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comFirst Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) is a great example of how excellent customer service can build strong and lasting relationships. Having been in operation for the past four decades, their commitment to providing private consumer and business banking and private wealth management in New York and California has resulted in hard-earned customer loyalty.First Republic Bank did not do well this year like other financial stocks. Part of the reason is the wider economic downturn. However, Co-CEO James Herbert taking a leave also played a part. However, the company recently reported a revenue increase of 16.9% YoY, and net income rose 21%. Therefore, there is a feeling abound that the stock has been harshly treated.Over the last four quarters, First Republic Bank has consistently posted healthy earnings. They far exceeded even the most optimistic of analysts’ predictions. This extraordinary performance should not be taken lightly – it is a testimony to the incredible management, leadership and competent staff that has enabled this financial institution to stand out as a leader in its field. With this consistent success over such an extended period, First Republic Bank will reap greater rewards. Investors are sure to take notice and respond accordingly.Signature Bank (SBNY)The logo for Signature Bank is displayed over the entrance to a building.Source: PL Gould / Shutterstock.comSignature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY) is a prominent commercial banking institution with assets valued at $114.47 billion in the third quarter of 2022. Despite recent market turbulence caused by FTX bankruptcy and cryptocurrency contagion anxiety among some investors, shares are attractive as experts anticipate a Federal Reserve rate increase to factor in future conditions.Signature Bank is certainly conscious of the FTX debacle. (If you want to take a deep dive into the collapse, here is a great piece from Luke Lango that gives a great blow-by-blow account. Louis Navellier has you covered if you want to know how to navigate the future of crypto investing, particularly in the case of tokens.) It decided to end digital asset-associated deposits, as they only had a deposit relationship with FTX, citing volatility due to recent events. This news sent ripples through the marketplace, leaving executives and enthusiasts alike wondering what’s next for digital assets.Signature Bank has long been at the forefront of fintech innovation. It offers a revolutionary payments platform tailored specifically to crypto exchanges and clients. Operating 24/7, Signet – as it’s called- provides users with real-time payment solutions, allowing instantaneous transactions within their portfolios. As an added benefit of using this service, customers can place large non-interest-bearing deposits into Signature bank accounts, further driving global financial developments.In 2021, Signature had an impressive year following its foray into crypto services. Unfortunately, market developments have since caused the company to scale back operations and reassess its situation. Most notably, the collapse of FTX sent ripples throughout the industry as it spread contagion to other prominent players in this sector. However, despite suffering losses along with many others, Signature escaped relatively unscathed. It did not possess substantial deposits connected with FTX, and further streamlining the business certainly can’t hurt.Visa (V)Visa logo outside of an office buildingSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) has undergone a remarkable transformation; From its humble beginnings as an ordinary payments network, it is now a powerful force in the rapidly growing field of financial technology. Fintech’s development and adoption have surged during these challenging times – indeed, Visa stands at the heart of this revolution.Unlike several other financial stocks investors are looking to buy, Visa did well this year. The stock is down close to 5%. This news will not stop the presses. However, the price movement becomes notable when you compare it to the S&amp;P 500, which is down almost 20% this year.Visa helps to power commerce around the world with its innovative payment network. In 2022, it propelled over $14 trillion in global sales. In addition, the payment processing company facilitated more than 250 billion transactions across over 80 million merchants worldwide. Boasting an impressive 3.9 billion cardholders, Visa continues to lead the way in digital payments processing networks on a grand scale. Despite a tough 2022, it still managed top-line growth of 19% in its latest quarter. In addition, Visa’s earnings outlook assumes ‘no recession’ and relieved investors spooked by the markets. Heading into 2023 puts Visa in a great position.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to read about similar stocks, you can go to 5 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley's Quant Screen.Morgan Stanley has been raising alarms about an ""earnings recession"" throughout 2022. We did a piece on Morgan Stanley's dividend stock picks back in September. At the time of that writing, Morgan Stanley's base case was the S&amp;P 500 plunging to 3,400 by the end of 2022 and the major bank's bear case was the S&amp;P 500 ending the year at 3,000. We are now at the end of the year and, as of December 28, the S&amp;P 500 sits well-above 3,800 points. However, the CIO of Morgan Stanley, Mike Wilson, maintains his relatively pessimistic outlook on the markets heading into 2023.""It's a Stock Picking Game""On December 15, Mike Wilson appeared in an interview on CNBC, where he discussed his outlook for the markets going into 2023. Mike Wilson noted that the Federal Reserve and inflation are old news and the markets have already priced that in. However, a slowdown in growth is not yet priced in by the markets which is ultimately going ""to determine the winners"". Here are some comments from the CIO of Morgan Stanley, Mike Wilson:""In October, the downtick in CPI was a surprise. We got a big rally off of that because rates came in. But to think you are going to get another rally on that news, I think that is a bit naive because you already had it... CPI has peaked, inflation has peaked, we are pretty confident that it is going to come down pretty hard next year, and the real question is, what does that mean about growth. And that is the second part of our bear market story that we have been talking about for almost twelve months now, that the growth slowdown is not yet priced. And that's what's going to determine the winners, like it's a stock picking game. There are going to be some companies that are going to deliver on that, but at the index level, we are pretty pessimistic that we can support these prices given our outlook on earnings next year...""Story continuesMike Wilson noted that Morgan Stanley is looking for a 15% to 20% earnings miss, well below or roughly 16% below Wall Street consensus, however the ""good news"" is that a majority of investors are on board. Mike Wilson said:""people assume earnings are going to come down, but it's the magnitude of that decline and how fast that's going to come down, we think that's where the surprise is. The negative operating levels that we see, from falling inflation by the way, is what's going to hurt margins, and that's irrespective of whether we have an economic recession.""Mike Wilson said that ""some companies are already in an earnings recession"" and that ""every quarter has been disappointing"", however, ""we haven't gotten any guidance on 2023, because companies have no reason to talk about 2023 until we get there"". When companies disclose their fourth quarter earnings, Mike Wilson expects that time to ""create the final plunge on multiples that can give us a real buying opportunity"". Mike Wilson finally noted that:""The bear market has been driven by Fed policy, higher rates, concerns about inflation, multiples have contracted. So we got relief on that, and that's why we rallied. But that's a trade because ultimately, stocks will care about the earnings decline as much as they care about the Fed pausing or even continuing for another couple of months.""According to Mike Wilson, ""it's a stock picking game"" and when companies report their fourth-quarter 2022 earnings, investors can get ""a real buying opportunity"".

(NYSE:VST) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We had a hard time deciding which company we should discuss in this letter. By just about every metric, all our holdings are cheap from both a relative and absolute perspective – especially compared to the performance of commodity prices and the recent pullback in the overall complex of energy stocks. For the first six months of 2022, oil was up 41%, natural gas up 45%, natural gas liquids up 34%, and the futures curve for electricity (in the two biggest deregulated power markets) is up ~30%, but our holdings were only up a measly ~1% by mid-year! The point is all our positions are investment stories worth telling.However, Vistra Corp stands out among the names we own. First, the market environment has improved materially over a multi-year basis, which will enhance VST’s ability to mint cash and at the same time underscores the longevity of VST’s asset base. Second, VST’s market value has remained flat, despite shrinking the share count by nearly 15% since adopting a transformational capital allocation strategy. The combination of those two factors results in ~50% more value in a VST share today than just six months ago.The bottom line is that the discount to intrinsic value of VST’s equity has become more attractive than ever. To better understand the two broader points, as well as our heightened conviction, it’s worth providing a brief history of the IPPs and summarizing the original VST investment thesis…” (Click here to see the full text)Some of the best-performing dividend stocks to buy according to Morgan Stanley's quant screen include Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), AbbVie Inc.

Given these points, a variety of infrastructure names will likely surge in 2023, making this a good time for longer-term investors to find good infrastructure stocks to buy.In addition to the infrastructure law, an imminent factory boom in the U.S., driven by the “onshoring” or “reshoring“ phenomenon and the transition to renewable energy and electric vehicles, should boost the financial results of many American infrastructure companies.From a maker of plane engines to train operators, an internet service provider, and, of course, companies that help roads and bridges get built, this column will give investors a variety of top-notch, safe infrastructure stocks to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTickerCompanyPriceVMCVulcan Materials$175.68UNPUnion Pacific$210.32CPCanadian Pacific$75.86GEGeneral Electric$82.84CATCaterpillar$243.14TAT&amp;T$18.46ETNEaton Corporation$157.34Vulcan Materials (VMC)The Vulcan Materials (VMC) website is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comWe’ll start off with Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC), a company that will get a big lift from the most basic, common type of infrastructure projects: the repair and construction of roads and bridges. That’s because VMC is one of the largest providers of raw materials used in developing roads “and other public works,” including stone, sand, gravel, and concrete, in America.And in a very good sign for Vulcan and VMC stock, billionaire investor George Soros last quarter bought 70,000 shares of VMC.Additionally, since Vulcan’s materials are used “in the construction of ..commercial, industrial, and other nonresidential facilities,” the trend of semiconductor, electric-vehicle, and renewable energy factories being built in the U.S. aka “onshoring,” should help Vulcan.Story continuesIn another positive development for VMC last quarter, institutions held or bought 115.9 million of its shares, while they only unloaded 5.7 million shares of VMC stock.While the forward price-earnings ratio of VMC stock is a slightly elevated 24.7, analysts may be underestimating the extent to which the infrastructure law and “onshoring” will boost Vulcan’s results in 2023.Union Pacific (UNP)United Pacific (UNP) switch on tracks near Kansas City.Source: Michael Rosebrock / Shutterstock.comUnion Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is one of the country’s largest freight train operators. On Dec. 20, CNBC contributor Jim Lebenthal theorized on the network that the “onshoring” trend would boost freight-train operators. That’s because freight trains will be used to carry the raw materials, which will be exploited to build the many factories that are being or will soon be developed in the U.S.I agree with that theory. But I also believe that freight-train operators will get a major lift from ferrying around the country the raw materials used to build the projects paid for by the infrastructure law.Also significant is the upgrade of UNP stock to “outperform” from “in line” by investment bank Evercore ISI on Dec. 20.Evercore raised its rating on UNP to “outperform” from “in-line.” As reasons for the upgrade, the firm cited valuation and railroads’ ability to be “nimble” during challenging macroeconomic environments. Evercore raised its price target on the shares to $232 from $204.Since BNSF Railway is a subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B), instead of Berkshire owning a portion of its stock, many retail investors may forget that the Oracle of Omaha is in the freight train business. Buffett’s wholehearted endorsement of the sector suggests that it will perform well over the long term.UNP’s forward price-earnings ratio is a reasonable 17.5, and it has a significant dividend yield of 2.5%.Canadian Pacific (CP)A photo of a Canadian National (CNI) train coming down the tracks toward the photographer.Source: Eric Buermeyer / Shutterstock.comA Canada-based freight-railroad operator, Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP), is in the midst of merging with one of its major American counterparts, Kansas City Southern. So CP, over the longer term, will also benefit from the infrastructure law and America’s factory boom.But the Canadian train company has its own current, positive catalysts. Specifically, the company has been benefiting from solid fertilizer, wheat, automotive, and intermodal volumes. Last quarter, its overall revenue surged 19% year-over-year, and it expects to end the year with an operating margin of around 55%.Also noteworthy is that Bill Ackman, a highly successful, multi-billionaire investor, last quarter significantly increased the number of shares of CP stock that he owns to 15.2 million from 2.94 million.Overall in Q3, institutions bought or held 636 million shares of CP stock and sold only 47.5 million shares.General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAircraft, like trains, are an important component of infrastructure revitalization. Therefore, I’m including GE (NYSE:GE), whose biggest business is making plane engines, on this list of infrastructure stocks to buy.According to one study carried out by SkyQuest Technology Consulting, the global aircraft market is going to grow at a robust average compound annual growth rate of 10.9% between 2021 and 2028.”SkyQuest explains that “Aircraft engines are in high demand due to the growing popularity of air travel. [And] airlines are expanding their fleets to keep up with the demand,”Meanwhile, when GE’s joint ventures are factored into the equation, it’s the world’s largest aircraft maker.On a different front, GE, which sells turbines that power natural gas plants and has a business focused on improving electrical grids, should benefit from the federal government’s upcoming investments in improving America’s electrical grid and preventing power outages.In January, the Department of Energy kicked off its “Building a Better Grid” program with the goal of creating “new and upgraded high-capacity electric transmission lines.” The department is also looking to “support the buildout of long-distance, high voltage transmission facilities,” and it plans to spend over $20 billion on the initiative.Caterpillar (CAT)stocks to buySource: ShutterstockCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) makes equipment, such as pavers and backhoes, used in construction. As a result, the company should get a big lift from both Washington’s infrastructure initiative and America’s factory boom.Moreover, CAT gets a significant percentage of its revenue from selling equipment to oil and natural gas explorers, which, as you might have heard, has been doing quite well. Finally, the firm has a significant farm equipment business, and the farm sector, which is being boosted by elevated food prices, is also doing quite well.Unsurprisingly, CAT reported very strong third-quarter results, as its top line jumped 21% year-over-year to $15 billion, and its Q3 earnings per share, excluding certain items, came in at $3.87, versus $2.60 during the same period a year earlier. Despite the impact of high inflation, the firm’s operating profit margin climbed to 16.2% last quarter, up from 13.4% in Q3 of 2021.The Street appears to be warming to Caterpillar, as the stock has jumped 46% over the last three months.Yet the shares still have an attractive price-earnings ratio of 17 times, and they also offer a significant dividend yield of 2%.AT&amp;T (T)AT&amp;T logo (T stock) representing communications stocksSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAs I noted in a November 2021 column on AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), the company is now focusing on its internet broadband and mobility (i.e., providing smartphone service ) businesses.Further, the infrastructure bill will provide $65 billion to bring broadband internet coverage to the parts of the country that don’t already have it.I believe that AT&amp;T’s recent decision to partner with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) on the launch of a “commercial fiber network…outside of AT&amp;T’s traditional..service” area represents an attempt by the telecom giant to prepare to compete for some of the dollars that Washington will spend on expanding broadband coverage. Indeed, the firm stated that the initiative would seek “to bridge the digital divide,” i.e., seek to bring broadband to those who don’t already have it. Not coincidentally, that’s the same goal that Washington is pursuing.Meanwhile, I’ve heard many other commentators note that the mobility businesses of AT&amp;T and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) should be resilient to macroeconomic challenges since most consumers are very reluctant to part with their smartphones at this point.T stock has a low trailing price-earnings ratio of 7.6 times and a high dividend yield of 6.1%.Eaton Corporation (ETN)An Eaton (ETN) sign on a company building.Source: Lukassek / Shutterstock.comLike General Electric, Eaton (NYSE:ETN) is well-positioned to benefit from the federal government’s upcoming spending on the electric grid and the boom of the commercial aircraft sector.That’s because Eaton specializes in developing “electric components” and “power distribution” systems, along with “power reliability equipment and services,” while its Aerospace unit provides many components of commercial airplanes.Impressively, last quarter, Eaton’s Electrical sector backlog soared 75% year-over-year, and its free cash flow jumped 36% YOY. The company’s earnings per share, excluding certain items, gained 15% YOY to a record $2.02.ETN expects its electrical business to benefit from “reshoring,” and the company anticipates providing “electrical infrastructure” to support the renewable-energy boom. Moreover, Eaton expects to get a lift from the proliferation of electric vehicles and the increased need to ensure the resiliency of electrical grids in the face of climate change.Despite its strong Q3 results and powerful upcoming catalysts, ETN stock has a reasonable forward price-earnings ratio of 19 times.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in GE.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, long term The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) shareholders have enjoyed a 66% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 31% (not including dividends).With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Procter &amp; Gamble managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.4% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 11% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Procter &amp; Gamble has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on Procter &amp; Gamble's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Procter &amp; Gamble the TSR over the last 5 years was 90%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Procter &amp; Gamble shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 5.0% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 22%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 14% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Procter &amp; Gamble better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Procter &amp; Gamble   you should know about.We will like Procter &amp; Gamble better if we see some big insider buys.

(NYSE:LUV) stock plummeted on Dec. 22 when news broke that the company was aggressively canceling or delaying flights in the wake of systemwide operational struggles resulting from adverse weather conditions. The U.S. has hardly seen flight cancellations of this proportion in the past, and Southwest flights were disrupted far more than its peers, which serves as a good enough reason for Mr. Market to punish the stock.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with LUV. Click here to check it out. LUV 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of LUVPeter Lynch Chart of LUVBad Weather Makes Southwest a BargainLUV Data by NASDAQ:AAL), which derives a major portion of its revenue from international flights. Southwests revenue declined to $9.04 billion in 2020 from over $22 billion in 2019 amid mobility restrictions that wreaked havoc in the global travel industry. In the last 12 months, Southwest has brought in $22.69 billion in revenue, suggesting the company has fully recovered from pandemic woes from a revenue perspective.What lies ahead for Southwest Despite revenues recovering sharply, Southwests profitability is nowhere near pre-pandemic levels. The company reported net income of $2.3 billion in 2019, but in the last 12 months, net income came to just $827 million. A sharp rise in costs is the main reason behind this negative development. If inflationary pressures subside in 2023 along with a cooldown in energy prices, Southwest will be able to report better operating efficiencies. In any case, revenue trends should likely move in the positive direction despite recession fears.According to the International Air Transport Association, North American airlines are estimated to report profits of $11.4 billion in 2023, a notable increase from $9.9 billion this year. Passenger demand growth is projected to outpace capacity, enabling the industry to see an improvement in operating margins resulting from higher prices. Although many Wall Street firms have called for a recession next year, the travel industry is not seeing a slowdown in spending. Perhaps after being confined indoors for the best part of 2020 and 2021, travelers are more eager to explore new destinations. The rising popularity of the work-from-anywhere culture is driving the demand for travel as well.Story continuesSouthwests industry-leading customer-friendly business practices, the return of business travelers and the revival of the leisure travel market outside of the U.S. should act as catalysts for the company to report steadily growing earnings in the coming years.Southwest Airlines has come a long way since 2020, but the market has hardly reacted to the positive developments. The recent disruptions caused by adverse weather conditions, on the other hand, pushed Southwest stock further down, and the company is now valued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 9.56, making it one of the most attractively priced airline companies in the United States. Many of the leading airliners are still struggling to break through to profitability while Southwest is already enjoying profits. As disruptions ease and the market focus shifts back to corporate earnings, I believe Southwest stock is likely to head higher in the future.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Given these points, a variety of infrastructure names will likely surge in 2023, making this a good time for longer-term investors to find good infrastructure stocks to buy.In addition to the infrastructure law, an imminent factory boom in the U.S., driven by the “onshoring” or “reshoring“ phenomenon and the transition to renewable energy and electric vehicles, should boost the financial results of many American infrastructure companies.From a maker of plane engines to train operators, an internet service provider, and, of course, companies that help roads and bridges get built, this column will give investors a variety of top-notch, safe infrastructure stocks to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTickerCompanyPriceVMCVulcan Materials$175.68UNPUnion Pacific$210.32CPCanadian Pacific$75.86GEGeneral Electric$82.84CATCaterpillar$243.14TAT&amp;T$18.46ETNEaton Corporation$157.34Vulcan Materials (VMC)The Vulcan Materials (VMC) website is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comWe’ll start off with Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC), a company that will get a big lift from the most basic, common type of infrastructure projects: the repair and construction of roads and bridges. That’s because VMC is one of the largest providers of raw materials used in developing roads “and other public works,” including stone, sand, gravel, and concrete, in America.And in a very good sign for Vulcan and VMC stock, billionaire investor George Soros last quarter bought 70,000 shares of VMC.Additionally, since Vulcan’s materials are used “in the construction of ..commercial, industrial, and other nonresidential facilities,” the trend of semiconductor, electric-vehicle, and renewable energy factories being built in the U.S. aka “onshoring,” should help Vulcan.Story continuesIn another positive development for VMC last quarter, institutions held or bought 115.9 million of its shares, while they only unloaded 5.7 million shares of VMC stock.While the forward price-earnings ratio of VMC stock is a slightly elevated 24.7, analysts may be underestimating the extent to which the infrastructure law and “onshoring” will boost Vulcan’s results in 2023.Union Pacific (UNP)United Pacific (UNP) switch on tracks near Kansas City.Source: Michael Rosebrock / Shutterstock.comUnion Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is one of the country’s largest freight train operators. On Dec. 20, CNBC contributor Jim Lebenthal theorized on the network that the “onshoring” trend would boost freight-train operators. That’s because freight trains will be used to carry the raw materials, which will be exploited to build the many factories that are being or will soon be developed in the U.S.I agree with that theory. But I also believe that freight-train operators will get a major lift from ferrying around the country the raw materials used to build the projects paid for by the infrastructure law.Also significant is the upgrade of UNP stock to “outperform” from “in line” by investment bank Evercore ISI on Dec. 20.Evercore raised its rating on UNP to “outperform” from “in-line.” As reasons for the upgrade, the firm cited valuation and railroads’ ability to be “nimble” during challenging macroeconomic environments. Evercore raised its price target on the shares to $232 from $204.Since BNSF Railway is a subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B), instead of Berkshire owning a portion of its stock, many retail investors may forget that the Oracle of Omaha is in the freight train business. Buffett’s wholehearted endorsement of the sector suggests that it will perform well over the long term.UNP’s forward price-earnings ratio is a reasonable 17.5, and it has a significant dividend yield of 2.5%.Canadian Pacific (CP)A photo of a Canadian National (CNI) train coming down the tracks toward the photographer.Source: Eric Buermeyer / Shutterstock.comA Canada-based freight-railroad operator, Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP), is in the midst of merging with one of its major American counterparts, Kansas City Southern. So CP, over the longer term, will also benefit from the infrastructure law and America’s factory boom.But the Canadian train company has its own current, positive catalysts. Specifically, the company has been benefiting from solid fertilizer, wheat, automotive, and intermodal volumes. Last quarter, its overall revenue surged 19% year-over-year, and it expects to end the year with an operating margin of around 55%.Also noteworthy is that Bill Ackman, a highly successful, multi-billionaire investor, last quarter significantly increased the number of shares of CP stock that he owns to 15.2 million from 2.94 million.Overall in Q3, institutions bought or held 636 million shares of CP stock and sold only 47.5 million shares.General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAircraft, like trains, are an important component of infrastructure revitalization. Therefore, I’m including GE (NYSE:GE), whose biggest business is making plane engines, on this list of infrastructure stocks to buy.According to one study carried out by SkyQuest Technology Consulting, the global aircraft market is going to grow at a robust average compound annual growth rate of 10.9% between 2021 and 2028.”SkyQuest explains that “Aircraft engines are in high demand due to the growing popularity of air travel. [And] airlines are expanding their fleets to keep up with the demand,”Meanwhile, when GE’s joint ventures are factored into the equation, it’s the world’s largest aircraft maker.On a different front, GE, which sells turbines that power natural gas plants and has a business focused on improving electrical grids, should benefit from the federal government’s upcoming investments in improving America’s electrical grid and preventing power outages.In January, the Department of Energy kicked off its “Building a Better Grid” program with the goal of creating “new and upgraded high-capacity electric transmission lines.” The department is also looking to “support the buildout of long-distance, high voltage transmission facilities,” and it plans to spend over $20 billion on the initiative.Caterpillar (CAT)stocks to buySource: ShutterstockCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) makes equipment, such as pavers and backhoes, used in construction. As a result, the company should get a big lift from both Washington’s infrastructure initiative and America’s factory boom.Moreover, CAT gets a significant percentage of its revenue from selling equipment to oil and natural gas explorers, which, as you might have heard, has been doing quite well. Finally, the firm has a significant farm equipment business, and the farm sector, which is being boosted by elevated food prices, is also doing quite well.Unsurprisingly, CAT reported very strong third-quarter results, as its top line jumped 21% year-over-year to $15 billion, and its Q3 earnings per share, excluding certain items, came in at $3.87, versus $2.60 during the same period a year earlier. Despite the impact of high inflation, the firm’s operating profit margin climbed to 16.2% last quarter, up from 13.4% in Q3 of 2021.The Street appears to be warming to Caterpillar, as the stock has jumped 46% over the last three months.Yet the shares still have an attractive price-earnings ratio of 17 times, and they also offer a significant dividend yield of 2%.AT&amp;T (T)AT&amp;T logo (T stock) representing communications stocksSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAs I noted in a November 2021 column on AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), the company is now focusing on its internet broadband and mobility (i.e., providing smartphone service ) businesses.Further, the infrastructure bill will provide $65 billion to bring broadband internet coverage to the parts of the country that don’t already have it.I believe that AT&amp;T’s recent decision to partner with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) on the launch of a “commercial fiber network…outside of AT&amp;T’s traditional..service” area represents an attempt by the telecom giant to prepare to compete for some of the dollars that Washington will spend on expanding broadband coverage. Indeed, the firm stated that the initiative would seek “to bridge the digital divide,” i.e., seek to bring broadband to those who don’t already have it. Not coincidentally, that’s the same goal that Washington is pursuing.Meanwhile, I’ve heard many other commentators note that the mobility businesses of AT&amp;T and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) should be resilient to macroeconomic challenges since most consumers are very reluctant to part with their smartphones at this point.T stock has a low trailing price-earnings ratio of 7.6 times and a high dividend yield of 6.1%.Eaton Corporation (ETN)An Eaton (ETN) sign on a company building.Source: Lukassek / Shutterstock.comLike General Electric, Eaton (NYSE:ETN) is well-positioned to benefit from the federal government’s upcoming spending on the electric grid and the boom of the commercial aircraft sector.That’s because Eaton specializes in developing “electric components” and “power distribution” systems, along with “power reliability equipment and services,” while its Aerospace unit provides many components of commercial airplanes.Impressively, last quarter, Eaton’s Electrical sector backlog soared 75% year-over-year, and its free cash flow jumped 36% YOY.

The joint agreement was reached between West Virginia American Water, PSC staff, and the PSC’s Consumer Advocate Division. The DSIC program and its associated surcharge mechanism allow the company to receive more timely cost recovery of certain infrastructure investments deemed just, reasonable, and in the public interest, enabling the company to accelerate its infrastructure replacement and reliability program.""West Virginia’s infrastructure recently received a ‘D’ grade from the American Society of Civil Engineers. The purpose of a DSIC is to address the national challenge of aging water infrastructure by directing additional investment to areas where improvements are most needed,"" said Robert Burton, president of West Virginia American Water. ""All parties involved in the agreement acknowledged the accelerated investments we’ve made since incorporating this surcharge in 2017 and recognize that this investment is a significant priority in the best interest of customers.""The approved DSIC, effective January 1, 2023, includes $48.7 million in system-wide upgrades that West Virginia American Water will make in 2023. The improvements include $31.0 million to replace or upgrade more than 16 miles of water mains; $6.4 million to replace service lines and fire hydrants; $9.3 million to replace water meters; and $2.0 million for post-acquisition investment on troubled water systems.Accordingly, customers will pay a 5.98 percent surcharge on their monthly bills (approximately $3.63 for the average residential customer) to help fund these projects.

But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. To wit, the Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) share price has flown 199% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock! On top of that, the share price is up 40% in about a quarter.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Freeport-McMoRan achieved compound earnings per share growth of 158% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 44% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Freeport-McMoRan, it has a TSR of 208% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Freeport-McMoRan shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 6.6% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 22%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 15% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Freeport-McMoRan (1 is significant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Freeport-McMoRan is not the only stock insiders are buying.

233,8222a7f8-be4e-3e20-adfb-c2d9ea26fc53,UNP,2022-12-31,7 Stocks to Buy as Infrastructure Spending Starts to Boom,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-infrastructure-spending-113347988.html,1672227227,STORY,"['RJF', 'CAT', 'VMC', 'UNP', 'ETN', 'CP']","[According to Patrick Tyler Brown, an investment bank Raymond James analyst, the U.S. federal government may deliver “a once-in-a-generation type infusion for infrastructure projects in [the] coming years.” Meanwhile, there are signs that billionaires and institutional investors are starting to pour money into infrastructure stocks ahead of the government’s likely, huge spending spree. Given these points, a variety of infrastructure names will likely surge in 2023, making this a good time for longer-term investors to find good infrastructure stocks to buy.In addition to the infrastructure law, an imminent factory boom in the U.S., driven by the “onshoring” or “reshoring“ phenomenon and the transition to renewable energy and electric vehicles, should boost the financial results of many American infrastructure companies.From a maker of plane engines to train operators, an internet service provider, and, of course, companies that help roads and bridges get built, this column will give investors a variety of top-notch, safe infrastructure stocks to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTickerCompanyPriceVMCVulcan Materials$175.68UNPUnion Pacific$210.32CPCanadian Pacific$75.86GEGeneral Electric$82.84CATCaterpillar$243.14TAT&amp;T$18.46ETNEaton Corporation$157.34Vulcan Materials (VMC)The Vulcan Materials (VMC) website is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comWe’ll start off with Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC), a company that will get a big lift from the most basic, common type of infrastructure projects: the repair and construction of roads and bridges. That’s because VMC is one of the largest providers of raw materials used in developing roads “and other public works,” including stone, sand, gravel, and concrete, in America.And in a very good sign for Vulcan and VMC stock, billionaire investor George Soros last quarter bought 70,000 shares of VMC.Additionally, since Vulcan’s materials are used “in the construction of ..commercial, industrial, and other nonresidential facilities,” the trend of semiconductor, electric-vehicle, and renewable energy factories being built in the U.S. aka “onshoring,” should help Vulcan.Story continuesIn another positive development for VMC last quarter, institutions held or bought 115.9 million of its shares, while they only unloaded 5.7 million shares of VMC stock.While the forward price-earnings ratio of VMC stock is a slightly elevated 24.7, analysts may be underestimating the extent to which the infrastructure law and “onshoring” will boost Vulcan’s results in 2023.Union Pacific (UNP)United Pacific (UNP) switch on tracks near Kansas City.Source: Michael Rosebrock / Shutterstock.comUnion Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is one of the country’s largest freight train operators. On Dec. 20, CNBC contributor Jim Lebenthal theorized on the network that the “onshoring” trend would boost freight-train operators. That’s because freight trains will be used to carry the raw materials, which will be exploited to build the many factories that are being or will soon be developed in the U.S.I agree with that theory. But I also believe that freight-train operators will get a major lift from ferrying around the country the raw materials used to build the projects paid for by the infrastructure law.Also significant is the upgrade of UNP stock to “outperform” from “in line” by investment bank Evercore ISI on Dec. 20.Evercore raised its rating on UNP to “outperform” from “in-line.” As reasons for the upgrade, the firm cited valuation and railroads’ ability to be “nimble” during challenging macroeconomic environments. Evercore raised its price target on the shares to $232 from $204.Since BNSF Railway is a subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B), instead of Berkshire owning a portion of its stock, many retail investors may forget that the Oracle of Omaha is in the freight train business. Buffett’s wholehearted endorsement of the sector suggests that it will perform well over the long term.UNP’s forward price-earnings ratio is a reasonable 17.5, and it has a significant dividend yield of 2.5%.Canadian Pacific (CP)A photo of a Canadian National (CNI) train coming down the tracks toward the photographer.Source: Eric Buermeyer / Shutterstock.comA Canada-based freight-railroad operator, Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP), is in the midst of merging with one of its major American counterparts, Kansas City Southern. So CP, over the longer term, will also benefit from the infrastructure law and America’s factory boom.But the Canadian train company has its own current, positive catalysts. Specifically, the company has been benefiting from solid fertilizer, wheat, automotive, and intermodal volumes. Last quarter, its overall revenue surged 19% year-over-year, and it expects to end the year with an operating margin of around 55%.Also noteworthy is that Bill Ackman, a highly successful, multi-billionaire investor, last quarter significantly increased the number of shares of CP stock that he owns to 15.2 million from 2.94 million.Overall in Q3, institutions bought or held 636 million shares of CP stock and sold only 47.5 million shares.General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAircraft, like trains, are an important component of infrastructure revitalization. Therefore, I’m including GE (NYSE:GE), whose biggest business is making plane engines, on this list of infrastructure stocks to buy.According to one study carried out by SkyQuest Technology Consulting, the global aircraft market is going to grow at a robust average compound annual growth rate of 10.9% between 2021 and 2028.”SkyQuest explains that “Aircraft engines are in high demand due to the growing popularity of air travel. [And] airlines are expanding their fleets to keep up with the demand,”Meanwhile, when GE’s joint ventures are factored into the equation, it’s the world’s largest aircraft maker.On a different front, GE, which sells turbines that power natural gas plants and has a business focused on improving electrical grids, should benefit from the federal government’s upcoming investments in improving America’s electrical grid and preventing power outages.In January, the Department of Energy kicked off its “Building a Better Grid” program with the goal of creating “new and upgraded high-capacity electric transmission lines.” The department is also looking to “support the buildout of long-distance, high voltage transmission facilities,” and it plans to spend over $20 billion on the initiative.Caterpillar (CAT)stocks to buySource: ShutterstockCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) makes equipment, such as pavers and backhoes, used in construction. As a result, the company should get a big lift from both Washington’s infrastructure initiative and America’s factory boom.Moreover, CAT gets a significant percentage of its revenue from selling equipment to oil and natural gas explorers, which, as you might have heard, has been doing quite well. Finally, the firm has a significant farm equipment business, and the farm sector, which is being boosted by elevated food prices, is also doing quite well.Unsurprisingly, CAT reported very strong third-quarter results, as its top line jumped 21% year-over-year to $15 billion, and its Q3 earnings per share, excluding certain items, came in at $3.87, versus $2.60 during the same period a year earlier. Despite the impact of high inflation, the firm’s operating profit margin climbed to 16.2% last quarter, up from 13.4% in Q3 of 2021.The Street appears to be warming to Caterpillar, as the stock has jumped 46% over the last three months.Yet the shares still have an attractive price-earnings ratio of 17 times, and they also offer a significant dividend yield of 2%.AT&amp;T (T)AT&amp;T logo (T stock) representing communications stocksSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAs I noted in a November 2021 column on AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), the company is now focusing on its internet broadband and mobility (i.e., providing smartphone service ) businesses.Further, the infrastructure bill will provide $65 billion to bring broadband internet coverage to the parts of the country that don’t already have it.I believe that AT&amp;T’s recent decision to partner with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) on the launch of a “commercial fiber network…outside of AT&amp;T’s traditional..service” area represents an attempt by the telecom giant to prepare to compete for some of the dollars that Washington will spend on expanding broadband coverage. Indeed, the firm stated that the initiative would seek “to bridge the digital divide,” i.e., seek to bring broadband to those who don’t already have it. Not coincidentally, that’s the same goal that Washington is pursuing.Meanwhile, I’ve heard many other commentators note that the mobility businesses of AT&amp;T and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) should be resilient to macroeconomic challenges since most consumers are very reluctant to part with their smartphones at this point.T stock has a low trailing price-earnings ratio of 7.6 times and a high dividend yield of 6.1%.Eaton Corporation (ETN)An Eaton (ETN) sign on a company building.Source: Lukassek / Shutterstock.comLike General Electric, Eaton (NYSE:ETN) is well-positioned to benefit from the federal government’s upcoming spending on the electric grid and the boom of the commercial aircraft sector.That’s because Eaton specializes in developing “electric components” and “power distribution” systems, along with “power reliability equipment and services,” while its Aerospace unit provides many components of commercial airplanes.Impressively, last quarter, Eaton’s Electrical sector backlog soared 75% year-over-year, and its free cash flow jumped 36% YOY. The company’s earnings per share, excluding certain items, gained 15% YOY to a record $2.02.ETN expects its electrical business to benefit from “reshoring,” and the company anticipates providing “electrical infrastructure” to support the renewable-energy boom. Moreover, Eaton expects to get a lift from the proliferation of electric vehicles and the increased need to ensure the resiliency of electrical grids in the face of climate change.Despite its strong Q3 results and powerful upcoming catalysts, ETN stock has a reasonable forward price-earnings ratio of 19 times.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in GE.
