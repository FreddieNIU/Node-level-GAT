NKE reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein revenues and earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s top and bottom lines also improved year over year and were ahead of our estimate. Results gained from brand strength, robust consumer demand and an innovative product pipeline.In the quarter, consumer demand for the company’s brands helped deliver strong double-digit currency-neutral revenue growth across NIKE, Jordan and Converse. The strong results were supported by continued strength in retail traffic trends within NIKE Direct, which boosted conversion rates. The strong member buying trends resulted in record digital results in the quarter.Following the strong results, shares of NIKE rallied 12.8% in the after-hours trading session on Dec 20. Investors were also optimistic about the company’s raised view for fiscal 2023, driven by the momentum witnessed in the second quarter.Overall, shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 4.7% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 4.9%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Q2 HighlightsIn second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company’s earnings per share of 85 cents rose 2% from 83 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents and our estimate of 68 cents.Revenues of the Swoosh brand owner grew 17% year over year to $13,315 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,606 million and our estimate of $12,547 million. On a currency-neutral basis, revenues advanced 27% year over year, driven by growth in the NIKE Direct business. Organic revenue growth was higher than our estimate of 19.8%.Sales at NIKE Direct were $5.4 billion, up 16% on a reported basis and 25% on a currency-neutral basis. The 25% currency-neutral increase included 34% growth at NIKE Digital and an 11% rise at NIKE stores, backed by a robust start to the holiday season. The NIKE Brand Digital’s revenues improved 25% on a reported basis and 34% on a currency-neutral basis.Wholesale revenues improved 19% on a reported basis and 30% on a currency-neutral basis. The increase can be attributed to elevated demand for seasonal products and higher shipments, owing to improved supply availability. The results also reflected gains from strong year-over-year comparisons, as the company lapped last year’s shipment delays due to supply constraints.Story continuesNIKE, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise NIKE, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNIKE, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | NIKE, Inc. QuoteOperating SegmentsThe NIKE Brand revenues were $12,724 million, up 18% year over year on a reported basis. We estimated NIKE Brand revenues of $11,987.9 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 10.8%. Revenues for the brand rose 28% on a currency-neutral basis. Results were driven by continued consumer patronage and strength across all geographies, except for Greater China.Within the NIKE brand, revenues in North America advanced 30% on a reported basis and 31% on a currency-neutral basis to $5,830 million. The upside can be attributed to strong market share gains, driven by a strong start to the holiday season and favorable consumer response to new merchandise. Wholesale revenues for the segment witnessed 37% growth, driven by strong marketplace partner demand and better inventory supply. Sales for the NIKE Direct business were up 23% in the region. Digital sales grew 31%, owing to double-digit growth in traffic and repeat buying trends by members.In EMEA, the company’s revenues rose 11% on a reported basis and 33% on a currency-neutral basis to $3,489 million, driven by broad-based growth. NIKE Direct revenues for the segment grew 44% on a currency-neutral basis, with 62% growth in NIKE Digital. Strong member demand during the Cyber Week was a key driver, marking the highest demand week ever for the EMEA business.In Greater China, revenues declined 3% year over year on a reported basis and rose 6% on a currency-neutral basis in the fiscal second quarter to $1,788 million. The region was impacted by the adverse impacts of COVID-19 disruption in the quarter, leading to muted store operations and retail traffic. NIKE Direct rose 4% on a currency-neutral basis, while NIKE Digital revenues improved 9% year over year.In APLA, NIKE revenues advanced 19% on a reported basis and 34% on a currency-neutral basis to $1,599 million. The increase was driven by strength in Korea. NIKE Direct advanced 30% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by a 35% surge in NIKE Digital.Revenues at the Converse brand grew 5% on a reported basis to $586 million. On a currency-neutral basis, revenues of the segment were up 12%, backed by double-digit growth in North America, somewhat offset by sluggishness in Asia.Costs &amp; MarginsThe gross profit rose 10% year over year to $5,711 million, while the gross margin contracted 300 basis points (bps) to 42.9%. The decline in the gross margin can be attributed to higher markdowns to liquidate inventory, mainly in North America, increased freight and logistics costs, elevated product input costs, and currency headwinds. This was partly negated by the company’s pricing actions.Selling and administrative expenses rose 10% to $4,124 million due to higher operating overhead and demand-creating expenses. As a percentage of sales, SG&amp;A expenses declined 210 bps from the prior-year quarter to 31%.Demand-creation expenses increased 8% year over year to $1,102 million, owing to elevated marketing and advertising investments.Operating overhead expenses were up 10% to $3,022 million on higher wage-related expenses and NIKE Direct costs, as well as increased technology investments to support digital transformation.Balance Sheet &amp; Shareholder-Friendly MovesThe company ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $6,490 million, down 40% year over year. It had long-term debt (excluding current maturities) of $8,924 million and shareholders’ equity of $15,272 million as of Nov 30, 2022.As of Nov 30, 2022, inventories of $9,362 million increased 43% from the prior-year levels due to an increase in units from the lapping of last year’s supply-chain issues, as well as higher input costs.In second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company returned $2.1 billion to shareholders, including $1.6 billion in share repurchases and $480 million in dividends.OutlookBacked by the strong fiscal second-quarter performance, management anticipates low-teens revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis for fiscal 2023 compared with low-double-digit revenue growth mentioned earlier. Revenue growth, on a reported basis, is expected to be in the mid-single digits compared with low to mid-single-digit growth stated earlier. The revised view includes 700 bps of currency headwinds versus an 800-bps impact mentioned earlier.For fiscal 2023, the company envisions a gross margin contraction of 200-250 bps, driven by continued liquidation actions in the second half. The gross margin decline includes 150 bps of adverse impact from significant markdowns and higher off-price mix to liquidate elevated inventory, along with more than 100 bps headwinds related to elevated freight and logistic costs, and unfavorable currency impacts of 95 bps.SG&amp;A for fiscal 2023 is predicted to increase in the high-single digits due to increased investment in new transformational capabilities, which is likely to be partly offset by reduced expenses and limited headcount growth across the business. The effective tax rate is expected to be in the high-teens range, driven by reduced benefits from stock-based compensation.Moreover, the company predicts third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenue growth to be higher than the fourth quarter due to the timing of wholesale shipments. For third-quarter fiscal 2023, the gross margin is likely to decline at a similar rate to the second quarter of fiscal 2023, comprising a 120-bps impact from adverse currency. SG&amp;A expenses are expected to be in line with the fiscal second quarter.Stocks to ConsiderHere we highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Oxford Industries OXM, PVH Corp.

It's a ritual that many children learn by watching and helping their parents cut cookies from hand-rolled dough and decorating them with festive themes… a tradition that is passed down to the next generation.Meryl Kennedy-Farr's favorite cookie is oatmeal chocolate chip, a treat that her mother started to enjoy when she was pregnant with her, ""Maybe, there's something to that,"" she said with a smile. And since 2016, Kennedy-Farr has been bringing cookie dough to many families all year round and especially every holiday season through her company, Neighbors Cookies, based in West Monroe, Ouachita Parish, Louisiana.""The act of making cookies is an act of love - we give cookies to those who we love, someone who's sick and needs support, or someone you want to say thank you to,"" says Kennedy-Farr, who's 34 years old.In 2016, Kennedy-Farr saw an opportunity and had the means to save a failing business in the community - a cookie company that was a staple serving the community for nearly two decades. With years of food industry experience, the manufacturing and packaging of a food product was well within her realm of knowledge. The youngest of four daughters, she was born and raised around her family's rice farm, which was founded by her father, Elton Kennedy, in the 1960s in Mer Rouge, 30 miles from West Monroe. At age 21, she became her father's assistant and, a decade later, the president of the family's agriculture business.When the West Monroe cookie dough factory nearly closed in 2016, Meryl bought it and named it Neighbors, LLC. The name was important to her - ""Neighbors"" is what her grandfather, who was the town minister, used to call the town's people and parishioners, ""because neighbors are an integral part of communities. ""At the time of the acquisition, Neighbors was primarily a fundraising business. Today it has expanded into a private label that's sold online; it does co-manufacturing; brand licensing for large CPG brands and grocery stores nationwide. One third of its business is still focused on producing cookie dough for fundraising channels used by sports teams, schools, and church groups.Story continuesIn 2021, Kennedy-Farr saw a need to automate one of the production lines to speed up their production volume. U.S. Bancorp Community Development Corporation (USBCDC), the community investment and tax credit subsidiary of U.S. Bank, partnered with Advantage Capital to provide Neighbors a $3,500,000 in New Markets Tax Credits investment to help her purchase the equipment she needed.Since then, the financing has helped Neighbors increase its production by 20% allowing it to add 15 quality jobs and another eight-hour shift to its operations.""With these exciting improvements, we have brought even more jobs to our community and with these continued investments in our employees, business and community, we expect even more growth as we enter 2023,"" she explained.According to the 2020 U.S. Census, West Monroe has 13,000 residents, 35% are white, 35% Black and almost 6% Hispanic or Latinos. The company currently has at least 150 employees and more than 50 percent of its workforce are people of color. Neighbor's provides quality jobs with an average wage of $20.23/hour and provides benefits including health insurance and paid time off.""U.S. Bank believes everyone deserves to live in a thriving community with access to opportunity and the ability to achieve financial stability,"" said Tracey G. Lowell, business development officer at USBCDC. ""Helping Neighbors grow and create jobs is changing the lives of the individuals who work here, and helps the entire community thrive.""Additionally, Neighbor's offers training classes for employees and more than 80% of the company's positions are accessible to those with a high school education. Many of the employees are people who live in the area's shelters and women who were formerly incarcerated.""We believe in Meryl's vision for the company, which is not only about the product they produce, but also how they support the local community,"" said Justin Obletz, managing director and CFO at Advantage Capital. ""Neighbors is having a great impact in a distressed community that needs access to quality jobs.""Neighbors has received several awards including the Thomas H. Scott Large Business of the Year award from the Ouachita Chamber of Commerce for its contributions to the Ouachita Parish economy.""I am very proud of the economic impact we have had as a company in a very underprivileged area of the country, added Kennedy-Farr. ""Our mission is to make sure that everyone in our company regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion has a work home where they feel safe to contribute and thrive.""During this holiday season, like many times before, families will be scooping out dozens of little balls of dough to create the perfect cookie to be shared with loved ones.""The holiday season should be about sharing neighborly love,"" said Kennedy-Farr.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Cintas: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to address Congress in person later, his first trip outside his country since Russia's invasion 10 months ago. Elon Musk is planning to resign as Twitter CEO just as soon as he can find ""someone foolish enough"" to want the job, and oil prices hit their highest in a week on signs that the U.S. government's switch from seller to buyer and G7 measures against Russia are tightening crude availability. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 21st December.1. Nike earnings cheer as inventories fallNike (NYSE:NKE) shares leaped after the sports gear giant said it had made good progress in whittling down excess inventory over the last three months.Nike reported a chunky 27% rise in constant-currency sales in the last three months late on Thursday and net income 30% ahead of expectations, with markdowns in North America particularly useful in shifting excess stock.It consequently raised its guidance for full-year.As Nike goes, so goes the global consumer? Maybe that’s a bit of an exaggeration, but the world’s largest maker of sportswear isn’t the worst proxy for consumer discretionary spending. Rivals Adidas (ETR:ADSGN) and Puma (ETR:PUMG) both gained in European morning trading in sympathy, as did U.K. retailer JD Sports (LON:JD).2. Zelenskyy in Washington, Medvedev in BeijingUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is to address the U.S. Congress in person later Wednesday, his first trip outside Ukraine since Russia invaded the country over 300 days ago.Zelenskyy is expected to ask the U.S. for Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) state-of-the-art long-range rocket artillery system, the so-called ATACMS, which would give the country much greater capability to strike targets in Russia, from where the drone and missile strikes against Ukraine’s energy and water infrastructure are being launched.Story continuesThe U.S. has so far resisted less public pressure for the ATACMS to be included in U.S. military aid, fearing escalation of the conflict.Overnight, Russia’s former President Dmitry Medvedev made an unannounced visit to Beijing for what he called “thoroughly useful” talks with President Xi Jinping. Chinese state TV said Xi had told Medvedev he is actively seeking “peace and talks” to end a war that is increasingly becoming a drag on Chinese exporters, while cementing Chinese-Russian trade links.3. Stocks set to open higher; home sales, consumer confidence data eyedU.S. stock markets are set to open higher later, building on Tuesday’s stabilization as the shock from a tightening of Japanese monetary policy was absorbed.By 06:30 ET (11:30 GMT), Dow Jones futures were up 272 points or 0.8%, while S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.6%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.4%, with the results from Nike clearly helping the tone.Other stocks likely to be in focus later include FedEx (NYSE:FDX), whose quarterly update late on Tuesday wasn’t half as impressive.Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) reports earnings early, while chipmaker Micron (NASDAQ:MU) reports after the bell. Existing home sales for November is the key economic release at 10:00 ET, along with the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index.4. Musk can't leave Twitter alone; Tesla said to freeze hiring Elon Musk may be giving up the CEO post at Twitter, but he isn’t going to be focusing exclusively on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) until he’s fixed the social media site’s workings.Musk tweeted on Tuesday that “I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software &amp; servers teams.” He had said last week that the job of rescuing Twitter would be too big for anyone.Tesla’s stock fell 8% in response on Tuesday but has recovered a little in premarket, despite a report in the fan mag Elektrek saying that the EV maker is to announce another round of layoffs and a hiring freeze in the coming quarter.5. Oil higher on inventory drop, Russian exports fearCrude oil prices hit their highest in a week after the American Petroleum Institute reported a bigger than expected drop in crude inventories last week – something that may or may not be corroborated by the government’s own data at 10:30 ET.Reports in Russian media that the country’s overall oil exports fell 11% from a year earlier in the three weeks after the G7 imposed its price cap also supported prices, by stoking fears of a prolonged shortage of Russian oil.By 06:45 ET (11:45 GMT), U.S. crude futures were up 1.6% at $77.43 a barrel, while Brent was up 1.7% at $81.35 a barrel.Related ArticlesNike cheers, Zelenskyy visits U.S., Tesla layoffs - what's moving marketsIndia's RBI may hike repo rate to 6.75% in 2023 - IDBI Bank's Arun BansalAnalysis-Opaque energy prices muddy euro inflation picture]"

(NYSE:WMT), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 47% stake, private companies possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Institutions, on the other hand, account for 32% of the company's stockholders. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Walmart, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Walmart ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walmart?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Walmart does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Walmart's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthWalmart is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Walton Enterprises, LLC is the largest shareholder with 37% of shares outstanding. With 10% and 4.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, Walton Family and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.To make our study more interesting, we found that the top 3 shareholders have a majority ownership in the company, meaning that they are powerful enough to influence the decisions of the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of WalmartThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Walmart Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$3.5b worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 19% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Walmart. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Private Company OwnershipOur data indicates that Private Companies hold 47%, of the company's shares. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

11,9d42c2e9-5190-3d32-a823-a2eae24993d8,WMT,2022-12-22,Inflation 2022: How Walmart Shoppers Were Affected,GOBankingRates,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inflation-2022-walmart-shoppers-were-120041933.html,1671710441,STORY,['WMT'],"[buzbuzzer / Getty ImagesDuring a mid-August call between Walmart brass and industry analysts, the word “inflation” came up 60 times.Just as shoppers all over the country were stressing about how to make ends meet in the face of rising prices, Walmart leaders were stressing about how to keep the customers they had and compete for those who were looking to replace their regular store of choice.Take a Look Back: 2022 Year in ReviewSNAP Benefits: Can You Use EBT Card/Food Stamps To Purchase Hot Food?Both Walmart and the people who shop there were forced to adapt in the face of the highest inflation in 40 years. And adapt they did.Supercenter Shoppers Opted for Cheaper Stores Closer to HomeDuring the early summer, when gas prices were at their highest, Walmart’s massive Supercenters saw weekly declines in foot traffic that culminated in a nearly 5% drop by mid-July. At the same time, Dollar General and discount grocer Aldi experienced double-digit gains.Reuters said it was the result of a double whammy for the world’s largest retailer.First, as inflation squeezed household budgets, traditional Walmart shoppers opted instead for budget options like dollar stores. Second, record-high gas prices convinced cash-strapped families to shop closer to home, as most Supercenters are located outside of major population hubs and often require shoppers to drive several miles to get to one.The inflation-driven change in shopping habits spelled bad news for Walmart. Even as gas prices dropped by 20% in the waning days of summer, there was no evidence that shoppers were returning to its Supercenters.Take Our Poll: Do You Think Student Loan Debt Should Be Forgiven?Buyers Had To Budget a Whole Lot More for GroceriesThe Reuters report showed that Aldi gained far more foot traffic than even Dollar General when Walmart traffic slowed, with the German discount food store seeing gains as high as 15.8%. It wasn’t hard to understand why.A study from the value investing site ValueWalk found that Walmart grocery prices climbed by 21.5% between 2019 and 2022, with much of the increase coming during the inflation spike that started in late 2021.Story continuesIn the meat and seafood department, the price of hot dogs jumped by more than 30%, sausages by more than 20%, chicken by more than 31% and ground beef by nearly 19%. In the produce department, the price of onions soared by an eye-popping 165.15%. At nearly 48%, olive oil was the hardest-hit condiment, and in the dairy department, eggs were up by more than 126% and the price of milk rose by more than 150%.Even the cost of canned goods soared. Tomato sauce, for example, jumped by nearly 57%.High-Income Consumers Traded Down to WalmartAccording to Winsight Grocery Business, Walmart typically caters to lower- and mid-income shoppers. When they lost portions of that market share to retailers like Aldi and Dollar General, they replaced at least some of those customers with higher-income shoppers.Just as regular Walmart shoppers were forced to trade down to dollar stores, wealthier consumers downgraded to Walmart from expensive alternatives like Whole Foods, where they had shopped before inflation whittled away their buying power.Those Who Stayed Flocked to Store Brands and Low-Cost ItemsThe same Winsight report showed that shoppers adapted to inflation by opting for cheaper alternatives to their usual purchases. The growth rate for Walmart’s private brands doubled in the second quarter of 2022 alone. On top of that, shoppers began forgoing things like expensive deli meat for cheaper alternatives like canned tuna and hot dogs.According to the New York Times, Walmart customers also saved money by pulling back from the purchase of discretionary items like clothing, electronics and non-necessity household goods.Investors Took a Wild Ride That They Ultimately SurvivedAccording to CNN, the wealthier shoppers that sought refuge at Walmart stuck with their new store of choice. By November, high-income customers had helped the retailer increase its sales by 8.2% in the third quarter, beating analyst expectations and boosting the company’s stock by 6.5%. According to the New York Times, it was the biggest one-day increase since 2020, and Walmart reported that revenue increased to a better-than-expected $153 billion.Just a few months earlier, none of that would have seemed possible.In a single week in May, Walmart stock lost 19.5% of its value — 11% in just one day. It was the result of disappointing first-quarter results that missed analyst expectations.Walmart wasn’t alone. Target and other big retailers suffered losses that spooked investors throughout the industry. The reason was beyond dispute — fast-rising inflation was forcing consumers to rein in spending.In the second quarter, however, Walmart’s fortunes were rising. It posted better-than-expected revenue and earnings results. While its sales were up, profits were down because Walmart had slashed prices to increase foot traffic and spur buying.In the end, Walmart weathered the storm. At the start of the year, its stock was trading at $144.65. As of Dec. 21, it’s right around the same price. By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 is down by more than 20%.More From GOBankingRates6 Shakeups to Social Security Expected in the New YearGet Top Holiday Shopping and Savings TipsThe 10 Best Rewards Credit Cards for 20237 Ways To Know You're Ready To Start InvestingThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Inflation 2022: How Walmart Shoppers Were Affected]"

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $27.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Equity Residential shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Equity Residential is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry that ranks in the Bottom 33% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 95 cents per share to 94 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Equity Residential right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

24,84371c8e-d99d-3cc8-a5bd-b17dee11c702,EQR,2022-12-22,3 Residential REITs to Consider Despite Industry Challenges,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-residential-reits-consider-despite-133601308.html,1671629761,STORY,"['EQR', 'MAA-PI', 'SUI', '^GSPC']","[The REIT And Equity Trust - Residential Industry constituents are expected to bear the brunt of soft rental housing demand amid low consumer confidence and weak household formation despite job gains and wage growth. Elevated deliveries and regulatory issues are also expected to add to the woes. Moreover, a hike in interest rates to counter inflation poses a risk to the flow of capital for this asset category. Also, interest expenses are expected to climb with rate hikes.Nevertheless, residential REITs like Equity Residential EQR, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. MAA and Sun Communities, Inc. SUI are poised to benefit as mortgage rates are high, and with the high cost of homeownership, the transition from renter to homeowner is difficult, making renting of apartment units a viable option. Also, residential REITs are banking on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation, rent growth and improve the efficiency of their operating platform.About the IndustryThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust - Residential category is engaged in owning, developing and managing a variety of residences. The types of residences include apartment buildings, student housing, manufactured homes and single-family homes. Residential REITs rent spaces in these properties to tenants and earn rental income in return. Markedly, some residential REITs also focus on specific classes or types of residences, or a particular geographical region. Moreover, unlike apartment buildings, manufactured homes and single-family homes that are open for leasing to all, the student housing units are leased only to students. Such real estates are, therefore, generally required to be set up within or in places closer to colleges and universities. Furthermore, the enrolment growth of educational institutes is a major driver of student housing assets.What's Shaping the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential Industry's Future?Weak New-Lease Apartment Demand: The inflationary environment and macroeconomic uncertainty are likely to have an adverse impact on this industry’s performance. In fact, despite growth in jobs and wages, new-lease apartment demand remains weak amid low consumer confidence and weak household formation. In addition, there is a seasonality impact during winter months. With leasing traffic remaining soft, apartment rents are likely to bear the brunt .Elevated Deliveries of New Units: Although supply-chain woes and labor challenges have impacted construction activity to some extent in recent quarters, deliveries of new units are likely to accelerate in a number of markets in the upcoming quarters as the ongoing construction activity remains high, resulting in a struggle on the part of landlords to lure renters. Per a RealPage report, the U.S. apartment market is on course to add almost 3,300 communities, comprising around 590,000 units in 2023. This marks the largest delivery volume since RealPage started tracking the U.S. apartment market 30 years ago. Although construction costs are up, landlords have been able to pass on the burden to renters, who are supported by wage growth to absorb cost increases through rent hikes.Rent Control and Higher Interest Rates: The rent-control regulations in some of the major markets might curb the growth tempo. In fact, in recent years, there has been an increase in states and municipalities implementing or considering rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations. This is limiting the residential REITs’ power to raise rents or charge non-rent fees. Moreover, the hike in interest rates to counter inflation poses a risk to the flow of capital for this asset category. This is likely to lead to volatility in asset prices. Also, interest expenses are expected to climb with rate hikes. However, mortgage rates are high, and with the high cost of homeownership, the transition from renter to homeowner is difficult, making renting of apartment units a viable option.Rebound in Demand for Student Housing Properties: There has been a significant rebound in demand for student housing properties on the reopening of campuses and in-person classes, as well as extracurricular activities, driving leasing activity and rent growth. Per a RealPage report, for fall 2023, already more than a quarter of student beds are pre-leased.Technology Adoption: Technological adoption gathered steam amid the social-distancing trend, and now residential REITs are combining technology with sales and service expertise, aiming at driving revenues, trimming costs, improving operating margins, as well as enhancing customer experience. The REITs are now focusing on virtual leasing assistance, virtual and self-guided tours, digital move-in process and process enhancements. Improvement in search and tour booking as well as smart home access has gained much attention, and residential REITs are focusing on these.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe REIT And Equity Trust - Residential industry is housed within the broader Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #167, which places it at the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the downward funds from operations (FFO) per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s growth potential. Since August 2022, the industry’s FFO per share estimate for 2022 has moved marginally down. Moreover, over the past year, the industry’s FFO per share estimate for 2023 has moved 1.0% south.However, before we present a few stocks that you might want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags on Stock Market PerformanceThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust - Residential industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Finance sector as well as the S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 33.2% during this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 19.4% and the broader Finance sector’s decline of 14.1%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-FFO (funds from operations) ratio, which is a commonly-used multiple for valuing Residential REITs, we see that the industry is currently trading at 15.16X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) of 16.99X. The industry is trading above the Finance sector’s forward 12-month P/E of 13.02X. This is shown in the chart below.Forward 12-Month Price-to-FFO (P/FFO) Ratio Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 25.48X, as low as 15.16X, with a median of 18.96X.3 Residential REIT Stocks Trying to Survive Industry ChallengesEquity Residential: Based in Chicago, IL, this residential REIT is one of the leading, publicly-traded multi-family REITs in the United States.It is well-positioned to benefit from its portfolio rebalancing efforts and a strong balance sheet. Equity Residential’s efforts to diversify its portfolio in the urban and suburban markets, with an affluent tenant base, bode well.Its strategic buyouts and focus on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation and efficiency of its operating platform act as tailwinds.Currently, EQR has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 FFO per share indicates a favorable outlook, with estimates revised marginally upward over the past two months to $3.53. The company’s shares have declined 12.3% so far in the quarter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Mid-America Apartment Communities:  Headquartered in Germantown, TN, and commonly known as MAA, this residential REIT is engaged in owning, managing, acquiring, developing and redeveloping quality apartment communities, mainly in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.Mid-America Apartment’s well-diversified Sunbelt-focused portfolio is set to gain from healthy operating fundamentals and a strong development pipeline. The favorable in-migration trends of jobs and households in SunBelt submarkets are likely to fuel demand.We expect strong rent growth and stable occupancy to drive revenues going forward. The prospects of its redevelopment program and progress in technology measures are likely to expand margins. Its solid balance sheet acts as a tailwind.MAA currently has a Zacks Rank #3. The recent trend in estimate revision indicates a favorable outlook for MAA. Particularly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 FFO per share has been revised 1.4% upward over the past month to $8.46.Also, the consensus mark for 2023 FFO per share has moved 0.3% north over the past month to $9.17. The company’s shares have declined 0.6% so far in the quarter.Sun Communities, Inc.: The Southfield, MI-based residential REIT enjoys a stake in or is engaged in the ownership or operation of manufactured housing communities, recreational vehicle (RV) resorts and marina properties across 39 states, Canada, Puerto Rico and the UK.This REIT is poised to benefit from its growth efforts in manufactured housing, RV resorts and marinas. The continued demand for affordable housing is acting as a tailwind, while demand for RV vacations is picking up pace amid the resumption of normalcy.  Sun Communities currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year FFO per share has been revised 1.1% upward in the past month. The company’s shares have increased 2.6% so far in the quarter.Note: Funds from operations (FFO) is a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs rather than net income as it indicates cash flow from their operations. FFO is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization to earnings and subtracting the gains on sales.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.42 a share 30 days away from its upcoming earnings release on January 20, 2023.HBAN has an Earnings ESP figure of 3.11%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.42 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.40.HBAN is one of just a large database of Finance stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Capital Southwest (CSWC).Capital Southwest is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on January 30, 2023. CSWC's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.59 a share 40 days from its next earnings release.Story continuesFor Capital Southwest, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.57 is 3.08%.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, HBAN and CSWC could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Russia will start buying yuan on the market next year if oil and gas revenues meet expectations, two sources told Reuters, a report confirmed by Finance Minister Anton Siluanov later on Thursday.Veles Capital analysts earlier wrote that should the rouble consolidate above the psychologically important levels of 70 per dollar, 75 to the euro and 10 per yuan, it could open up new downside horizons for the Russian currency.Falling export revenues in recent months have been exacerbated by a European Union oil embargo that began in December, when an oil price cap also took effect.Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 0.3% at $82.0 a barrel.Siluanov said the oil price cap had put pressure on the rouble in recent days, but that the recovery in imports was having a greater effect.""Restrictions were imposed on oil, on gas. They are not functioning today in terms of financial consequences, but they have probably had a moral impact on market participants,"" the Interfax news agency quoted Siluanov as saying.Story continuesTAX SUPPORTThe rouble closed last week at 64.65 to the dollar, but analysts have said they expect the rouble to find a foothold next week when month-end taxes, which usually see Russian exporters convert FX revenues to pay local liabilities, are due.Russia has borrowed heavily in the final quarter of the year, on Wednesday selling 337.8 billion roubles ($4.96 billion) of OFZ treasury bonds.Russian banks have bought the vast majority of government debt, with sanctions preventing access for foreign investors, who had traditionally been attracted by Russia's high yields.Dominant lender Sberbank plans to build its liquidity buffer using bonds with floating-rate coupons, Anatoly Popov, deputy chairman of Sberbank's executive board, told the RIA news agency.

Here are the top language moments of the year, as selected by maslansky + partners, a leading language strategy firm:The language leadership moment of the year: Zelensky's quote, ""We don't need a ride, we need ammunition,"" demonstrated his commitment to his fellow Ukrainians and showed that he was not backing down in the face of challenges.The smartest reframe of the year: The change in language from the ""Stop Sexualization of Children Bill"" to the ""Don't Say Gay Bill"" sparked a larger debate about the bill's true intentions and impact on the LGBTQ+ community.The message that impacted the midterms: President Biden's declaration that ""Democracy is on the ballot for us all"" resonated with voters and played a significant role in the outcome of the midterm elections.The language we weren't supposed to see that changed the course of the midterms: Leaked documents from Alito stating that ""Roe and Casey must be overruled"" brought the issue of abortion to the forefront of the midterm elections.The language that changed our view of a celebrity: Tom Brady's admission that ""There's a lot of (shit) going on"" at age 45 humanized the star athlete and allowed people to relate to him in a new way. On the other hand, Will Smith's outburst, ""Keep my wife's name out your f****ing mouth!"" damaged his reputation and led to a negative perception of his persona.The message that came too late: House Republicans' ""Commitment to America"" platform, introduced just weeks before the midterm elections, was seen as a positive message but came too late to have a significant impact on the outcome.The language that changed a company before our eyes: Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter and his declaration that ""The bird is freed"" signaled a new era for the social media platform.The phrase that put a spotlight on a trend: The term ""Quiet Quitting"" brought attention to the phenomenon of employees leaving their jobs without announcing their departure or seeking a new position.The phrase that demonstrated the power of contrast: Representative Kinzinger's statement, ""President Trump did not fail to act during the 187 minutes between leaving the Ellipse and telling the mob to go home, he chose not to act,"" helped to change the narrative surrounding the events of January 6th and highlighted the intention behind the president's actions.The language that created the Florida Model of Conservatism: Governor DeSantis' message of ""Freedom is here to stay"" resonated with voters and helped him secure a victory in the midterm elections. This language has come to define the Florida Model of Conservatism and has influenced political discourse in the state.About maslansky + partnersmaslansky + partners is a language strategy firm widely recognized as a leader in communication, research, and messaging.

Russia will start buying yuan on the market next year if oil and gas revenues meet expectations, two sources told Reuters, a report confirmed by Finance Minister Anton Siluanov later on Thursday.Veles Capital analysts earlier wrote that should the rouble consolidate above the psychologically important levels of 70 per dollar, 75 to the euro and 10 per yuan, it could open up new downside horizons for the Russian currency.Falling export revenues in recent months have been exacerbated by a European Union oil embargo that began in December, when an oil price cap also took effect.Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 0.3% at $82.0 a barrel.Siluanov said the oil price cap had put pressure on the rouble in recent days, but that the recovery in imports was having a greater effect.""Restrictions were imposed on oil, on gas.

But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. For example, the Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) share price is down 49% in the last year. That's disappointing when you consider the market declined 21%. Longer term shareholders haven't suffered as badly, since the stock is down a comparatively less painful 21% in three years. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 13% in thirty days. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. See our latest analysis for Salesforce To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Unfortunately Salesforce reported an EPS drop of 85% for the last year. The share price fall of 49% isn't as bad as the reduction in earnings per share. So despite the weak per-share profits, some investors are probably relieved the situation wasn't more difficult. Indeed, with a P/E ratio of 464.49 there is obviously some real optimism that earnings will bounce back.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Salesforce's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Salesforce shareholders are down 49% for the year. Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 21%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 5% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

(NYSE:CRM) are down nearly 50% this year, proving to be yet another victim of the broad market selloff despite being one of the most successful technology companies in the cloud-based software industry.For many growth investors, Salesforce has always been an appealing proposition because it is one of the leading cloud-based customer relationship management software providers. Further, the company has seen strong revenue growth and market share gains in recent years.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with CRM. Click here to check it out. CRM 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CRMPeter Lynch Chart of CRMThe businessSalesforce operates a CRM platform, Customer 360, which connects customer data across systems, applications and devices. It works with data and platforms across cloud, mobile, social media, analytics software and artificial intelligence-powered solutions, which enable businesses to sell, market and conduct business from anywhere. The company's services also include document management, analytics, custom application development, customer service and additional cloud-based marketing.The company also allows customers to store data, track leads and progress, forecast opportunities, gain insights and deliver quotes, contracts and invoices. Salesforce is a key player in the software-as-a-service market, having seen its market share steadily increase over the last five years. Its continued growth propelled the company to the top of the enterprise software industry in 2022.Why has the stock fallen in 2022?However, concerns regarding rising interest rates and the slowdown in global business activities have caused the stock to struggle this year. Following the pandemic surge, most tech companies have reported slow growth, which should have been anticipated as mobility restrictions in 2020 pulled forward years of expected growth.Despite reporting robust growth amid challenging operating conditions in late November, Salesforce's stock dropped by more than 8% immediately after the earnings release as investors weighed in on the surprise resignation of co-CEO Bret Taylor. The company issued weak guidance for the next quarter, which was another development that was not welcomed by the market. Although Salesforce has generated positive cash flow for several years, cash flows have recently declined significantly, which is another concern. Operating cash flow for the quarter ended Oct. 30 was $313 million, a 23% year-over-year decline.Story continuesThe long-term outlook remains promisingSalesforce is the world's largest cloud-based CRM platform provider. Every cloud-based company benefited from the digital transformation trend that accelerated in early 2020, and Salesforce capitalized on this opportunity with its subscription model and proprietary apps. The company expanded rapidly by acquiring smaller companies as well.After two years of stellar performance, revenue growth has decelerated this year, prompting investors to punish the stock. This slowdown has been caused by macroeconomic headwinds as companies of every size are cutting back on spending and postponing large software deals. The rising dollar, which has been bolstered by higher interest rates, has resulted in currency headwinds as well. Given these macro headwinds, Salesforce expects revenue to rise only 12% to 13% in the fourth quarter with adjusted eanings per share expected to increase by only 3%. The company also expects currency exchange costs to surpass $900 million.Despite these concerns, Salesforce has a long runway for growth with the world still in the early stages of embracing the work-from-anywhere trend. As companies representing highly regulated industries enter the cloud, Salesforces addressable market will expand in the coming years. The companys major acquisitions in 2022, which included Slack, Tableau, Mulesoft and Demandware, also strengthen its cloud-based ecosystem. The full integration of these platforms should help Salesforce see higher operating margins in the future.Salesforce announced on Dec. 15 that it will add more than 250 commerce partner apps to AppExchange, a leading enterprise cloud marketplace offering ready-to-install apps, solutions and consultants to help businesses save money, increase efficiency and drive customer success on commerce cloud. The expected improvement in e-commerce penetration of global retail sales in the next five years should also help the company attract more clients.Wall Street analysts are turning bullishEarlier this month, many analysts downgraded Salesforce's stock on the back of key executives leaving the company and macroeconomic headwinds continuing to create short-term troubles.Today, analysts are turning a corner after incorporating the recent decline in Salesforce's stock. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) recently released its contrarian picks for 2023 and highlighted that Salesforce is one of its top picks to outperform the market next year. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives also tapped Salesforce as a potential outperformer in 2023 despite the company having a tough time this year.The rosy long-term outlook for the cloud computing industry has a lot to do with these decisions.TakeawayThe world's largest provider of customer relationship management software is no longer a favorite among growth investors. The pessimism toward Salesforce is unlikely to change for the better in the short run because of the challenges faced by the tech sector.In the long run, however, earnings will dictate the market performance of any company, and Salesforce is well-positioned to deliver robust earnings growth in the next decade. The short-term volatility in the stock, therefore, could be offering a long-term opportunity.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

If you want to read about some more tech stocks for long term investment, go directly to 5 Best Tech Stocks For Long Term Investment.In no era of human history have business and technology been so inextricably linked as they are in the present times. The significance of this can be gauged from a recent report that outlines the six trending industries in 2022. All of these overlap with the technology space. The industries include space tech, bio tech, neuro tech, robot tech, climate tech, and energy tech. These trends were witnessed despite a broad macro slowdown at the market which favored value stocks as investors reevaluate their risk profiles in light of recession fears. According to analysts, the tech industry remains a robust choice for business growth and career advancement in 2022. As per a recent report, the information technology market grew from $8,384.32 billion in 2021 to $9,358.51 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate of 11.6%. This growth came despite the pandemic, the Russia Ukraine war, and economic uncertainties. Looking forward into 2023, these growth trends are likely to accelerate as the economy recovers from a tumultuous 2022. Investors should monitor long-term trends in the tech space, like the optimizing of IT systems for greater reliability, maintaining the value integrity of production AI systems and scaling vertical offerings, as well as the accelerating strategies to tap new virtual markets. Digital immune systems, applied observability, AI trust, risk and security management, industry clouds platform, platform engineering, wireless value realization, super apps, adaptive AI, metaverse, and sustainable technology are all also sectors investors should keep a close eye on. Some of the top stocks in the tech sector for the long term include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). Analysts have urged leading technology providers to play a top role in helping enterprises use innovative technologies to slide through the current storms of disruption. The use of tech as a safe haven in times of recession, especially in the services sector, is also likely to rise in the coming years. Story continuesSource:PixabayOur MethodologyThe companies that have long-term growth catalysts and operate in the tech sector were selected for the list. Special importance was assigned to outlining the basic business fundamentals and analyst ratings for each firm to provide readers with some context so they can make more informed investment choices. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Best Tech Stocks For Long Term Investment12. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40 International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) provides integrated solutions and services worldwide. On December 13, the firm announced that it had signed a deal with Rapidus to work on developing the breakthrough 2 nanometer node technology of the former for implementation in Japan by the latter. The US government plans to invest hundreds of billions in chip firms over the next few years to shore up chip manufacturing in the country. As the demand for electronics and electric vehicles rises, so will the demand for chips. IBM can jump on this growth curve by investments in the chip space. On October 18, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan maintained a Buy rating on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stock and lowered the price target to $145 from $155, noting that it has been estimated that about 80% of the software portfolio is non-transactional contracts linked to mission-critical projects.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Boston-based investment firm Arrowstreet Capital is a leading shareholder in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) with 4.3 million shares worth more than $515.8 million. Just like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the best tech stocks for long term investment. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, St. James Investment Company, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was not the first company to build computers. The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department in the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.One cannot overstate how powerful IBM was in the computer industry in the 1950s and 1960s. Every competitor rightly worried that if their product worked too well for too long, it was only a matter of time before an army of IBM salesforce representatives mobilized. In their easily recognizable uniforms of starched white shirts, red ties and blue suits, IBM marketers marched on their customers and offered a more expensive, but much more defensible, choice. “Nobody gets fired for buying IBM” was a common phrase. Even competitors acknowledged that the company excelled at sales. As a UNIVAC executive once complained, ‘It doesn’t do much good to build a better mousetrap if the other guy selling mousetraps has five times as many salesmen.’” (read more)11. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69    Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, manufactures and sells computer products and technologies worldwide. On November 18, Intel revealed that it has introduced its real-time DeepFake detector, FakeCatcher. This Deep Fake detector analyzes the blood flow in the video pixels to return results in milliseconds with an accuracy of 96%. The product is just one example of the growth path that the firm has in different sectors, like video editing and news dissemination, as the demand for powerful chips rises. The company, one of the leading US-based plays in the semi space, is also a reliable dividend player for the long term. On October 31, Citi analyst Christopher Danely maintained a Neutral rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock and lowered the price target to $27 from $30, noting that the company reported mixed results and guided well below consensus driven by the PC downturn.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 69 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.9 billion in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 65 in the preceding quarter worth $2.5 billion.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”10. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74   Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. On December 5, Micron Technology revealed that its mobile memory chip, low-power double data rate 5X (LPDDR5X), is gaining market traction with the validation of its mobile memory for Qualcomm Technologies’ latest mobile platform for flagship smartphones. The smartphone market is one of the biggest businesses in the world. Billions of people own smartphones and are increasingly reliant on these machines for many basic tasks. Micron, whose chips power these phones, has a steady avenue of growth in the smartphone space for the long-term. On October 7, Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers maintained an Overweight rating on Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stock and lowered the price target to $70 from $75, noting that it won’t be surprising to see shares trading lower ahead of the upcoming first-quarter earnings release.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 74 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.5 billion in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”9. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88   Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, and energy generation and storage systems. On September 30, Tesla launched the prototype of its humanoid robot named Dubbed Optimus. This launch has set a mark on reshaping the future of physical work using artificial intelligence. The company said that the robot is running on its Self-Driving computer. Over the years, the firm has distinguished itself in the electric vehicle space through the use of cutting-edge software that competitors are often lacking. The foray into robotics underscores the innovation-driven values of the firm which have helped it build such a strong profile in the EV space. On December 13, Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney maintained a Buy rating on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock and lowered the price target to $235 from $305, noting that it is believed that if Tesla can demonstrate that its demand levers and the Inflation Reduction Act contribution can help drive strong growth and margins in the coming quarters, then an upside case could be visible for the stock to trade to about $300.     At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 88 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $7.4 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 73 in the preceding quarter worth $7.2 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In 2014, before we began to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Musk’s electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Tesla’s prospects. That was principally for two reasons:First, automobile manufacturing and distribution is unusually complicated, capital intensive, and highly regulated, which makes profitability problematic;second, cars with ICE motors require extensive annual maintenance, and dealer services revenues, not profits from automobile sales, are the most important contributor to profits of perpetual licensed ICE car dealerships.Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE, not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motors’ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful. (click here to read more…)8. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89     NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 16, NVIDIA made a multi-year partnership with Microsoft to build a supercomputer powered by Microsoft Azure’s advanced supercomputing infrastructure. This would be one of the most powerful cloud-based artificial intelligence supercomputers in the world. NVIDIA chips are considered some of the most advanced across the world and are especially popular among gaming enthusiasts. This niche has helped the company establish a stable foundation which it is now using to expand into new spaces in the tech sector. On December 12, Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay maintained an Outperform rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and raised the price target to $220 from $200, noting that the company is believed to be the leader in accelerated computing, and maintains wide and deep technological moats.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with 19.3 million shares worth more than $2.3 billion.  In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“At the company-specific level, there was a broad correction across the entire portfolio. While four of our holdings contributed to performance, the contribution to absolute returns was less than 100bps combined, as unfortunately none of them was large enough to move the needle. We had 16 investments detracting over 100bps each with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), our second largest detractor, costing the Fund 254bps.NVIDIA’s stock was hit even harder, down 44.4%, impacted by concerns over the health of the consumer, dramatic declines in crypto, and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Despite the sell-off and the increased near-term volatility in its gaming business, NVIDIA’s revenues grew 46% year-over-year with 48% operating margins, driven by continued strength in its data center business as companies across industries adopt AI and ML…(read more)7. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 103    ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) provides enterprise cloud computing solutions that define, structure, consolidate, manage, and automate services for enterprises worldwide. On October 5, ServiceNow unveiled that it would acquire Era Software, an observability and log management innovator. The company said that customers will be able to gather actionable insights that deliver value across the business, within a single solution purpose-built for the era of digital business. The purchase highlights the growth momentum in the software industry that has showed it can handle macro pressures this year. As more businesses go digital, the firm can expect to grow significantly in the coming years. On October 27, Truist analyst Joel Fishbein maintained a Buy rating on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stock and lowered the price target to $525 from $550, noting that the company reported a strong quarter of constant-currency growth, but currency headwinds continue to be a drag on the top line performance and are starting to impact the bottom line as well.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management LLC is a leading shareholder in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) with 1.7 million shares worth more than $639.7 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Ensemble Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an enterprise software company that helps its corporate customers integrate all of their various software products into a unified platform. Their products are a key element in driving the digital transformation nearly every large company is undergoing. At the recent JP Morgan investor day, CEO Jamie Dimon explained that while the company could reduce expenses if needed should the economy slow, their spending on digital transformation would continue as this spending was critical to the company managing costs and maximizing revenue over time. As an example of this type of spending, Dimon specifically pointed to ServiceNow, calling out that the company’s products now oversaw the single largest collection of JP Morgan data and highlighted that working with them had saved JP Morgan $50 million over the past few years.

(NYSE:CRM) provides customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together worldwide. On September 21, Salesforce revealed its real-time platform Genie, a hyper-scale real-time data platform that powers the entire Salesforce Customer 360 platform. With this platform, every company can turn data into customer magic, delivering seamless, highly personalized experiences across sales, service, marketing, and commerce. The revelation is the latest example of the leading cloud services provided by the firm to businesses across the world. The firm is firmly committed to a strategy focused on delivering growth while continuing to expand operating margins. On December 5, Credit Suisse analyst Phil Winslow maintained an Outperform rating on Salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) stock and lowered the price target to $225 from $250, noting that the company reported solid third-quarter results on the income statement.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 117 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $8.2 billion in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), compared to 116 in the preceding quarter worth $7.9 billion. Along with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the best tech stocks for long term investment. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has become a dominant global player in sales, customer service, commerce and marketing software over the past 20 years. The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. This discount is an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Tech Stocks For Long Term Investment. Suggested Articles:15 Biggest Endowments in the US10 Best BDC Stocks To BuyTop 13 Gas Tanker Shipping Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

49,f0f1f7e0-52c5-34c6-a10f-64bd33ee9e34,SEE,2022-12-22,Sealed Air Global Impact Report: From Innovation to Impact,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sealed-air-global-impact-report-134500995.html,1671630300,STORY,['SEE'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / December 21, 2022 / Sealed AirQ&amp;A with Ron Cotterman, VP of Sustainability Innovation and StrategyAt Sealed Air (SEE), Ron Cotterman's primary focus is advancing new solutions that enhance the sustainability of products, processes, and services, with an overall goal to prevent waste, enable circularity, and reduce climate impacts across the packaging value chain.How Does SEE Define Innovation?There's much more to innovation than coming up with a new package for a customer. Innovation is about bringing together insights, technologies, and business models to solve customer challenges while anticipating things that may have unintended consequences.At SEE, we work to understand customer market needs before we design solutions. We take into account everything from packaging performance, digital information, and automation requirements to sustainability, circularity, and carbon footprint. By applying this holistic approach, we create customer and societal value that exceeds the packaging investment.Increasingly, innovation is needed to solve large, complex challenges that go beyond what a single company can do. These days to be truly innovative you also have to be truly collaborative. It's like a puzzle where you fit what your company does best with what other companies do best. Only by collaborating can you achieve an outcome that's bigger than the sum of the individual pieces.Sealed Air is an innovative company not because we introduce new materials but because we think about innovation by how it works in a system, how it drives value to business models, and how companies can collaborate across the value chain to achieve desired results.What Innovation Challenges Does SEE Face?One of our biggest innovation challenges is understanding how to drive sustainability without creating unintended consequences. For example, simplifying flexible plastic packaging materials to enable mechanical recycling could actually cause negative impacts if packaging performance is affected or product waste increases. As a result, we need to understand how various product and supply chain factors can affect overall sustainability.Story continuesWhen it comes to sustainable design, the analogy I like to use is it would be better to use a compass for this journey than a speedometer. A compass tells you which direction to go, which is better than the speedometer which only tells you how fast you're going to get there. Knowing the direction you need to head with a focus on sustainability, is much better than getting to the wrong place quickly.How Does Innovation Align with SEE's Sustainability Pledge?We work to ensure recycled or renewable content and recyclability are top of mind when designing customer material solutions that also meet our 2025 Sustainability Pledge. In today's environment, this can be particularly difficult because of a lack of recycling infrastructure, a lack of supply of recycled or renewable materials for food or health-care applications, and inadequate performance of alternatives that can have a negative climate impact.SEE is leading efforts to design plastic packaging to be easier to recycle and to contain recycled content, for both mechanical and advanced recycling processes. At the same time, we are pioneering developments in fiber and paper-based packaging systems to enable those materials to perform better for product protection.Consider SEE's new fiber tray for packaging fresh proteins. There was more to it than just switching from plastic to paper. We looked at the overall impact the fiber tray would have on our customers' productivity and carbon footprint. We considered consumer confusion over how to recycle food packaging. And most importantly, we ensured the material substitution brought forth all performance attributes that were necessary to protect and distribute the product.How is SEE Collaborating to Drive Innovation and Sustainability?Coming together for the greater good is essential for industries in today's hyper-competitive environment. While SEE is leading a number of major circularity collaborations, we want to encourage others in our industry to follow us and work together to evolve material design, post-consumer collection, and sorting and recycling infrastructure. The challenge is getting more companies to work together to demonstrate that a circular economy for flexible packaging is possible and then supporting the education, advocacy, and investments needed to build scale for our industry.Read Sealed Air's Global Impact Report Here.Learn More About Sealed Air's ESG and Sustainability Efforts Here.Sealed Air, Wednesday, December 21, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Sealed Air on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Sealed AirWebsite: http://www.sealedair.comEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Sealed AirView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/732748/Sealed-Air-Global-Impact-Report-From-Innovation-to-Impact]"

    Wednesday, Dec. 21, 2022Editor's note: The Yahoo Finance Tech Newsletter will be taking off next week for the holidays. We'll be back on Jan. 4.The best-ish and worst tech stocks of the yearTo say the tech industry’s biggest players had a rough 2022 on Wall Street would be an understatement.The litany of problems: difficult year-over-year comparisons to 2021’s pandemic-era highs, rising interest rates, the highest inflation numbers in decades, and supply chain bottlenecks caused by COVID lockdowns in China. All combined to whack Big Tech’s stock prices.The bleeding hasn't stopped as the year comes to a close. Poor digital ad sales, recession fears, and a slowdown in consumer spending on products like PCs hammered social media firms, chip makers, and even managed to eat into cloud growth.All of that is to say, 2022 has been a year of bad and worse for tech stocks. To that end, we’ve put together a basket of some of the biggest tech companies to compare how their shares have performed year-to-date as of midday on Dec. 20.But we can’t exactly call these the best performing big-name tech stocks of 2022.After all, year-to-date, shares of these companies were down more than the S&amp;P 500’s -19.82%. So instead, we’re calling these the best-ish and worst performing tech stocks of 2022.'Best' performersApple (-25.49% YTD)A stock that’s seen its price drop more than 25% year-to-date would likely be among the worst performers any other year, but 2022 wasn’t like most years. So here we are, with Apple (AAPL) sitting at the top.The company kicked off the year with its best Q1 revenue to-date—$123.9 billion—and continued that trend through the fourth quarter. But Apple also suffered as foreign exchange rates cut 3% from its overall revenue numbers in Q3. Then there were the reports that the company needed to trim manufacturing orders for the iPhone 14 Plus amid lower than expected sales. There was hope, however, that that meant more consumers were turning toward Apple’s pricier iPhone 14 Pro line, which would raise Apple’s average iPhone selling price.Story continuesApple CEO Tim Cook holds the new iPhone 14 at an Apple event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 7, 2022. (Image: Reuters Carlos Barria)Unfortunately, COVID lockdowns in China and worker protests at Foxconn’s largest iPhone plant hampered Apple’s ability to get its Pro smartphones into consumers’ hands in a timely manner, extending wait times by weeks.That said, Apple’s standing as a stalwart in the tech industry space—and continued demand for its products and services—helped ensure that its stock ended 2022 in a better position than many of its peers.Microsoft (-27.34% YTD)Microsoft (MSFT) started off 2022 with a strong showing from its all-important Intelligent Cloud business, which includes its Azure platform. And while the division continued to grow throughout the year, it began to slow compared to the highs it saw in 2021.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. (Image: AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)In its October quarter, Microsoft reported growth in its Intelligent Cloud business slowed to 20% year-over-year, far lower than the 31% growth the segment saw in the same quarter last year. Azure growth, in particular, fell to 35% in Q1 versus 50% in the same quarter last year.The company also had to deal with falling digital ad sales as well as a steep drop in PC sales from their pandemic-driven highs. Microsoft pointed to a number of macro headwinds that cut into its bottom line over the year including the war in Ukraine, foreign exchange rates, and COVID lockdowns in China.Like Apple, though, Microsoft’s stock still managed to outpace shares of its competitors (listed below) in 2022.Qualcomm (-37.44% YTD)Companies like Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA) got hammered as consumers and businesses cut back on PC purchases just as the chip shortage eased. The result? Firms ended up with elevated inventory levels with nowhere to sell their silicon. Despite that, Qualcomm (QCOM), which primarily develops chips for smartphones, beat out its fellow chip stocks in 2022.Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon is further diversifying the company away from its reliance on smartphones. (Image: Ethan Miller/Getty Images)To be sure, the company needed to revise its quarterly expectations downward during the year, and continued to warn of a drop in handset sales. Still, Qualcomm’s decision to supply chips to other sectors including the automotive and server markets could serve as a means for the company to pull itself away from its dependence on smartphone sales.Perhaps one of the biggest surprises out of Qualcomm in 2022 was the announcement that it will provide the bulk of 5G chips for Apple’s iPhones in 2023. Apple was originally expected to start cutting out Qualcomm for its own chips, but that didn’t quite workout the way the company planned due to technical problems building the chips, as Bloomberg reported.Worst performersAMD (-53.31%)If Apple takes the top spot of best-ish performers despite its share price falling more than 25%, you know the worst performing stocks had to have a terrible year. And with AMD (AMD) dropping 53.31% year-to-date, you’d be correct.AMD CEO Lisa Su holds up a 3rd generation Ryzen desktop processor during a keynote address at CES 2019. (Image: Reuters/Steve Marcus)The chip maker suffered many of the same problems its peers faced in 2022, including a steep slowdown in PC sales compared to during the pandemic when everyone was in the market for a new computer. Like Qualcomm, AMD had to revise its fiscal year revenue downward to account for the drop in PC sales in 2022.Tesla (-60.62% YTD)Tesla (TSLA) has had quite the year. While it started off 2022 strong, it faced an uphill battle from foreign currency rates and increases in the prices of raw materials. It didn’t help that the electric automaker also had to deal with COVID shutdowns in China, impacting its ability to produce vehicles in the market.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has taken heat from investors over his decision to purchase Twitter. (Image: AP Foto/Susan Walsh, File)But you can’t talk about Tesla’s performance in 2022 without also discussing CEO Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover. The move, which saw Musk seeking to buy the company, then trying to back out after Twitter agreed—and finally purchasing the social network ahead of a potential lawsuit over his attempt to abandon the deal—has been one long headache.The mercurial CEO fired staff, made controversial moderation decisions, and, recently, suspended the accounts of journalists who reported on the suspension of an account that posted information about Musk’s private jet. All the while questions swirl about whether Musk is able to keep running Tesla, while simultaneously dealing with Twitter, SpaceX, and his various other ventures. Tesla investors are also worried that Musk is using the EV maker to keep Twitter afloat, hurting Tesla’s share price.Meta (-64.41%)Things seemingly couldn’t get worse for Meta (META) this year. The company’s stock price fell a staggering 64.41% year-to-date on a host of poor reports. First off, Meta was struck by the decline in digital ad sales throughout the year. That’s compounded by the impact of Apple’s iOS privacy changes, which have been cutting into Meta’s overall sales since it was introduced in 2021.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg saw the company's stock price collapse this year amid slowing digital ad sales and questions about his investments in the metaverse. (AP Photo/Nick Wass, File)The company has also been criticized for how much it’s spending on its quest to become a metaverse-first company. After dropping $10 billion on the effort in 2021, Meta is going to spend even more by the end of this year.There’s still no sign that the move is paying off either.Meanwhile, Facebook is becoming less popular with younger users, as TikTok continues to snap up teens and, increasingly, older users. According to an August study by the Pew Research Center, just 32% of the polls 1,316 responding teens say they use Meta’s Facebook app.All of this culminated in Meta laying off some 11,000 employees in November.If one company needs to dramatically turn things around in 2023, it’s easily Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta.By Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Cowen predicted revenue of $33.9 billion, and UBS said $32.3 billion.Google estimated Azure ending the FY22 with an operating loss of $(3) billion, down from a loss of more than $(5) billion the prior year.Google said Azure’s sales and marketing costs accounted for 34% of consumption revenue. Microsoft said sales and marketing costs for the whole company equaled 11% of revenue over the same period.“There’s no way it’s that big of a loss,” Cowen analyst Derrick Wood said. His research shows Azure boasting an operating margin above 30%, compared with Google’s estimate of a (10)% margin loss.AWS recorded an operating margin of 26% in the third quarter, while Google’s cloud group reported an operating margin loss of -(10)%.According to Gartner, AWS controlled 39% of the global cloud infrastructure market in 2021, followed by Microsoft at 21%, China’s Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) at 9.5%, and Google at 7.1%.Google and Microsoft invested heavily to prevent Amazon Web Services from dominating the market it pioneered in 2006.If Google is right, Microsoft’s Azure consumption revenue (ACR) would be about 40% the size of Amazon’s AWS business and 27% larger than Google’s cloud business.Story continuesGoogle’s calculations suggest that ACR is the primary source of revenue for Azure and other cloud services.Google made a series of assumptions based on the leaked ACR information.None of the three U.S. market leaders disclosed gross margins for their cloud groups.Cowen expects the broader Azure and other cloud services group to account for 27% of Microsoft’s revenue in FY23. He says Microsoft could clarify things by providing a more granular breakdown.Photo by Rainer Stropek via FlickrSee more from BenzingaVideo Gamers Prosecuted Microsoft Over Activision Deal Citing Antitrust ElementsGoogle Poached BlockFi Veteran To Further Web3 AmbitionsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

If you want to read about some more tech stocks for long term investment, go directly to 5 Best Tech Stocks For Long Term Investment.In no era of human history have business and technology been so inextricably linked as they are in the present times. The significance of this can be gauged from a recent report that outlines the six trending industries in 2022. All of these overlap with the technology space. The industries include space tech, bio tech, neuro tech, robot tech, climate tech, and energy tech. These trends were witnessed despite a broad macro slowdown at the market which favored value stocks as investors reevaluate their risk profiles in light of recession fears. According to analysts, the tech industry remains a robust choice for business growth and career advancement in 2022. As per a recent report, the information technology market grew from $8,384.32 billion in 2021 to $9,358.51 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate of 11.6%. This growth came despite the pandemic, the Russia Ukraine war, and economic uncertainties. Looking forward into 2023, these growth trends are likely to accelerate as the economy recovers from a tumultuous 2022. Investors should monitor long-term trends in the tech space, like the optimizing of IT systems for greater reliability, maintaining the value integrity of production AI systems and scaling vertical offerings, as well as the accelerating strategies to tap new virtual markets. Digital immune systems, applied observability, AI trust, risk and security management, industry clouds platform, platform engineering, wireless value realization, super apps, adaptive AI, metaverse, and sustainable technology are all also sectors investors should keep a close eye on. Some of the top stocks in the tech sector for the long term include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). Analysts have urged leading technology providers to play a top role in helping enterprises use innovative technologies to slide through the current storms of disruption. The use of tech as a safe haven in times of recession, especially in the services sector, is also likely to rise in the coming years. Story continuesSource:PixabayOur MethodologyThe companies that have long-term growth catalysts and operate in the tech sector were selected for the list. Special importance was assigned to outlining the basic business fundamentals and analyst ratings for each firm to provide readers with some context so they can make more informed investment choices. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Best Tech Stocks For Long Term Investment12. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40 International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) provides integrated solutions and services worldwide. On December 13, the firm announced that it had signed a deal with Rapidus to work on developing the breakthrough 2 nanometer node technology of the former for implementation in Japan by the latter. The US government plans to invest hundreds of billions in chip firms over the next few years to shore up chip manufacturing in the country. As the demand for electronics and electric vehicles rises, so will the demand for chips. IBM can jump on this growth curve by investments in the chip space. On October 18, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan maintained a Buy rating on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stock and lowered the price target to $145 from $155, noting that it has been estimated that about 80% of the software portfolio is non-transactional contracts linked to mission-critical projects.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Boston-based investment firm Arrowstreet Capital is a leading shareholder in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) with 4.3 million shares worth more than $515.8 million. Just like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the best tech stocks for long term investment. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, St. James Investment Company, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was not the first company to build computers. The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department in the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.One cannot overstate how powerful IBM was in the computer industry in the 1950s and 1960s. Every competitor rightly worried that if their product worked too well for too long, it was only a matter of time before an army of IBM salesforce representatives mobilized. In their easily recognizable uniforms of starched white shirts, red ties and blue suits, IBM marketers marched on their customers and offered a more expensive, but much more defensible, choice. “Nobody gets fired for buying IBM” was a common phrase. Even competitors acknowledged that the company excelled at sales. As a UNIVAC executive once complained, ‘It doesn’t do much good to build a better mousetrap if the other guy selling mousetraps has five times as many salesmen.’” (read more)11. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69    Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, manufactures and sells computer products and technologies worldwide. On November 18, Intel revealed that it has introduced its real-time DeepFake detector, FakeCatcher. This Deep Fake detector analyzes the blood flow in the video pixels to return results in milliseconds with an accuracy of 96%. The product is just one example of the growth path that the firm has in different sectors, like video editing and news dissemination, as the demand for powerful chips rises. The company, one of the leading US-based plays in the semi space, is also a reliable dividend player for the long term. On October 31, Citi analyst Christopher Danely maintained a Neutral rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock and lowered the price target to $27 from $30, noting that the company reported mixed results and guided well below consensus driven by the PC downturn.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 69 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.9 billion in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 65 in the preceding quarter worth $2.5 billion.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”10. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74   Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. On December 5, Micron Technology revealed that its mobile memory chip, low-power double data rate 5X (LPDDR5X), is gaining market traction with the validation of its mobile memory for Qualcomm Technologies’ latest mobile platform for flagship smartphones. The smartphone market is one of the biggest businesses in the world. Billions of people own smartphones and are increasingly reliant on these machines for many basic tasks. Micron, whose chips power these phones, has a steady avenue of growth in the smartphone space for the long-term. On October 7, Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers maintained an Overweight rating on Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stock and lowered the price target to $70 from $75, noting that it won’t be surprising to see shares trading lower ahead of the upcoming first-quarter earnings release.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 74 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.5 billion in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”9. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88   Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, and energy generation and storage systems. On September 30, Tesla launched the prototype of its humanoid robot named Dubbed Optimus. This launch has set a mark on reshaping the future of physical work using artificial intelligence. The company said that the robot is running on its Self-Driving computer. Over the years, the firm has distinguished itself in the electric vehicle space through the use of cutting-edge software that competitors are often lacking. The foray into robotics underscores the innovation-driven values of the firm which have helped it build such a strong profile in the EV space. On December 13, Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney maintained a Buy rating on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock and lowered the price target to $235 from $305, noting that it is believed that if Tesla can demonstrate that its demand levers and the Inflation Reduction Act contribution can help drive strong growth and margins in the coming quarters, then an upside case could be visible for the stock to trade to about $300.     At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 88 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $7.4 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 73 in the preceding quarter worth $7.2 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In 2014, before we began to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Musk’s electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Tesla’s prospects. That was principally for two reasons:First, automobile manufacturing and distribution is unusually complicated, capital intensive, and highly regulated, which makes profitability problematic;second, cars with ICE motors require extensive annual maintenance, and dealer services revenues, not profits from automobile sales, are the most important contributor to profits of perpetual licensed ICE car dealerships.Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE, not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motors’ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful. (click here to read more…)8. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89     NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 16, NVIDIA made a multi-year partnership with Microsoft to build a supercomputer powered by Microsoft Azure’s advanced supercomputing infrastructure. This would be one of the most powerful cloud-based artificial intelligence supercomputers in the world. NVIDIA chips are considered some of the most advanced across the world and are especially popular among gaming enthusiasts. This niche has helped the company establish a stable foundation which it is now using to expand into new spaces in the tech sector. On December 12, Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay maintained an Outperform rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and raised the price target to $220 from $200, noting that the company is believed to be the leader in accelerated computing, and maintains wide and deep technological moats.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with 19.3 million shares worth more than $2.3 billion.  In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“At the company-specific level, there was a broad correction across the entire portfolio. While four of our holdings contributed to performance, the contribution to absolute returns was less than 100bps combined, as unfortunately none of them was large enough to move the needle. We had 16 investments detracting over 100bps each with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), our second largest detractor, costing the Fund 254bps.NVIDIA’s stock was hit even harder, down 44.4%, impacted by concerns over the health of the consumer, dramatic declines in crypto, and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Despite the sell-off and the increased near-term volatility in its gaming business, NVIDIA’s revenues grew 46% year-over-year with 48% operating margins, driven by continued strength in its data center business as companies across industries adopt AI and ML…(read more)7. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 103    ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) provides enterprise cloud computing solutions that define, structure, consolidate, manage, and automate services for enterprises worldwide. On October 5, ServiceNow unveiled that it would acquire Era Software, an observability and log management innovator. The company said that customers will be able to gather actionable insights that deliver value across the business, within a single solution purpose-built for the era of digital business. The purchase highlights the growth momentum in the software industry that has showed it can handle macro pressures this year. As more businesses go digital, the firm can expect to grow significantly in the coming years. On October 27, Truist analyst Joel Fishbein maintained a Buy rating on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stock and lowered the price target to $525 from $550, noting that the company reported a strong quarter of constant-currency growth, but currency headwinds continue to be a drag on the top line performance and are starting to impact the bottom line as well.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management LLC is a leading shareholder in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) with 1.7 million shares worth more than $639.7 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Ensemble Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an enterprise software company that helps its corporate customers integrate all of their various software products into a unified platform. Their products are a key element in driving the digital transformation nearly every large company is undergoing. At the recent JP Morgan investor day, CEO Jamie Dimon explained that while the company could reduce expenses if needed should the economy slow, their spending on digital transformation would continue as this spending was critical to the company managing costs and maximizing revenue over time. As an example of this type of spending, Dimon specifically pointed to ServiceNow, calling out that the company’s products now oversaw the single largest collection of JP Morgan data and highlighted that working with them had saved JP Morgan $50 million over the past few years.

(NYSE:CRM) provides customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together worldwide. On September 21, Salesforce revealed its real-time platform Genie, a hyper-scale real-time data platform that powers the entire Salesforce Customer 360 platform. With this platform, every company can turn data into customer magic, delivering seamless, highly personalized experiences across sales, service, marketing, and commerce. The revelation is the latest example of the leading cloud services provided by the firm to businesses across the world. The firm is firmly committed to a strategy focused on delivering growth while continuing to expand operating margins. On December 5, Credit Suisse analyst Phil Winslow maintained an Outperform rating on Salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) stock and lowered the price target to $225 from $250, noting that the company reported solid third-quarter results on the income statement.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 117 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $8.2 billion in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), compared to 116 in the preceding quarter worth $7.9 billion. Along with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the best tech stocks for long term investment. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has become a dominant global player in sales, customer service, commerce and marketing software over the past 20 years. The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles.

Apple, Microsoft, and Qualcomm did slightly better.",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tech-stocks-had-rough-apple-154447710.html,1671637487,VIDEO,"['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'QCOM']","[Yahoo Finance’s Daniel Howley joins the Live show to discuss the best tech stocks of 2022, which include Apple and Microsoft.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: It's been a rough year for tech, to say the least. And while it's been a sea of pain across the board for the sector, we are taking a look at the tech names in 2022 that have done better than its competitors, making it the best-ish performers of the year. With all the details here now, we've got Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. Dan.DAN HOWLEY: That's right, Brad. Yeah, not a great year for tech by any stretch of the imagination. Not a good year for the S&amp;P 500 at all. But there are some companies that manage to do, as you said, better than others. They're bad and then the worst. So these are the best-ish kind of companies. We obviously have Apple, Microsoft, and Qualcomm. Let's start off with Apple, which, year to date, as of the close on the 20th, had a whopping negative 25.49% on its stock price. And so, not great.This isn't something you would normally have as a best of the year, but still, as far as the tech basket that we looked at goes, this was the top performer. And if you want to talk about why Apple did well, its Q1 had record revenue. It continued to do well throughout the year, posting record quarters for each subsequent quarter on the power of the iPhone sales.We know that towards the end of the year, there were those disruptions as far as protests at the plant over in China, where they make the iPhone Pro, the iPhone 14 Pro. That caused some slowdowns in the ability for iPhones to get into consumers' hands. And then we had heard that Apple was also telling its manufacturers to slow down the production of the iPhone 14+, just because people simply weren't that interested in it. So it's been rough going for Apple, as it has been the rest of the sector.But as far as the basket that we looked at, it could have been a lot worse. After Apple, we also have Microsoft, another, obviously, big stalwart in the tech space. They continue to do well as far as their cloud offerings go, the Azure platform being the main standout there.Story continuesBut the problem was that they started to see year over year growth slow as far as that all important business goes. They still managed to do very well. We obviously had the cloud up 20% year over year in Q1 fiscal 2023. That's their most recent quarter. Their calendar is all sorts of mixed up. So they aren't doing exactly bad, but they did manage to beat out the likes of Amazon and Google as far as the cloud business goes. And so they're one of our best-ish.And then finally, surprisingly, a chip company, we have Qualcomm. While Intel, AMD, Nvidia were all basically dogs for the year, Qualcomm managed to do relatively well. And the reason for that has to do with a number of things, chief among them the fact that they're trying to diversify outside of relying so heavily on the handset space. So they're getting into servers. They're getting into PCs. They're getting into automotive. And they've been doing this for some time, but they seem to be stepping it up a lot more.The other thing had to do with the fact that their 5G chips are going to continue to be in Apple's iPhones. They originally were only expecting to provide roughly 20% of the chips for iPhones next year. Now they're going to be somewhere around 100%. And that has to do with the fact that Apple simply hasn't been able to get the technology to where they want it to be. Qualcomm's already got it, so why not just go ahead and continue to use there? So for the year, these are the three-- I mean, it's just laughable-- best-ish tech stocks that we've managed to pull together. We'll have the worst tomorrow, and my God, those are bad.JULIE HYMAN: I don't know. I'm bracing myself for that. I mean--DAN HOWLEY: They're rough.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I mean, I'm looking at the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, and every single component in there was down on the year. How are these company executives, how are analysts, how are investors feeling after this year that they have had?DAN HOWLEY: It's interesting. It's because we obviously have talked about these trends that we've seen where PC sales down, smartphone sales. People are starting to pull back a little bit. The big spenders, the businesses, they're starting to pull back a little bit, just because of inflationary pressures. The idea that maybe we're going into recession, that seems to change that narrative every day. But that seems to be the big issue for a lot of these companies. That, and we had the huge problems with supply during the pandemic era.Now there's just too much inventory because people aren't buying enough of them. They already put all of these products out there. So they're trying to get rid of all that extra channel inventory. So that's really the main discussion that we're seeing overall. But I think going forward, they're a lot more upbeat than you otherwise might think, considering the numbers that we're seeing.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I wouldn't expect very much upbeat at all, given those returns. Thanks so much, Dan Howley. Appreciate it.]"

If you want to read about some more tech-as-a-service stocks, go directly to 5 Best TaaS Stocks to Buy Now.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that global growth will slow to 2.7% next year, the weakest pace seen since 2001. In a recent report, the world body forecast that the global GDP growth is expected to remain at about 3.2% in 2022, down from 6% in 2021. The US GDP growth is projected to be only 1% during this time, even as the benchmark indexes in the country register impressive gains on the back of easing fears around aggressive rate hikes at the end of the fiscal year. The slowing economy would suggest that investors stay away from technology stocks that are traditionally seen as operating in the growth sector. However, shrewd investors now seem to understand that technology has permeated each aspect of human life and there are several prominent tech names, like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), that offer technology-as-a-service products immune from recessionary environments. As the US economy tackles extremely high inflation and a very tight labor market, tech stocks have also had to contend with several significant interest rate increases that have taken the federal funds rate up from 0% to 3.75%-4% currently, with another 0.5% rate hike expected to come in December. Despite these pressures, big tech continues to dominate the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite. Investors also seem unwilling to look beyond these popular tech names for growth strategies. Technology-as-a-Service (TaaS)Technology-as-a-Service (TaaS) is powered by tech products and provided as services. Unlike the traditional generation of labor-based services, the services of TaaS companies are highly software-enabled, customizable to business contexts, and often virtually delivered by a system of hardware, software and people. Technology-as-a-Service is the rising future for technology sectors. This model has already been showcased in the computing industry. Nowadays, most successful companies in this industry are no longer hardware giants but those that also provide software services.Story continuesIn 2022, more and more businesses are taking advantage of advances in technology. Improvements like near-ubiquitous high-speed broadband, cheap data storage, simple payment solutions, micro-services, and growing acceptance among both consumers and C-level leaders of subscription model services, have been made at a rapid pace. Altogether, these developments create a technology eco-system where software, platforms and services have moved out of the office and changed into server centers in the cloud.Photo by Joshua Mayo on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe companies that offer tech-related services were selected for the list. Special importance was assigned to outlining the basic business fundamentals and analyst ratings for each firm to provide readers with some context so they can make more informed investment choices. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Best TaaS Stocks to Buy Now11. DocuSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:DOCU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38    DocuSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:DOCU) provides electronic signature software in the United States and internationally. On December 8, DocuSign posted earnings for the third quarter of 2022, reporting earnings per share of $0.57, beating market estimates by $0.15. The revenue over the period was $645.5 million, up 18.3% compared to the revenue over the same period last year and beating market estimates by $18.27 million.On December 9, BofA analyst Brad Sills maintained a Neutral rating on DocuSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:DOCU) stock and lowered the price target to $65 from $80, noting that healthy billings upside from early traction with new go-to-market initiatives was reported by the firm.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, St. Petersburg, Florida-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in DocuSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:DOCU) with 5.5 million shares worth more than $294.6 million. Just like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), DocuSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:DOCU) is one of the best TaaS stocks to buy now according to elite investors. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Rowan Capital Street, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and DocuSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:DOCU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In the case of DocuSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:DOCU), the “Management” part no longer satisfies our requirements to remain in our investment portfolio. In the past 6-9 months, the company has had a huge turnover in both employees and upper management. In June of 2021, the board decided to get rid of Dan Springer, who had been the CEO of DocuSign since 2017 and took the company public in 2018. We found this decision strange as we thought that he did a great job growing the company over the past 5 years (revenues grew almost 5x from $519 million in 2017 to an estimated $2.4 billion this year).Dan was faced with a very difficult, unprecedented operating environment just like all the CEOs of SaaS companies. From Q2 ‘20 until Q3 ‘21, during pandemic shutdowns, growth exploded from about 30% to 60%+, as there was a ton of pull-forward demand. The business doubled in about 6 or 7 quarters! As the world opened up after the pandemic, growth slowed quite a bit, especially in comparison to these abnormal pandemic quarters. However, on a 3-year CAGR basis, growth was still very healthy (sales grew from $974 million in 2019 to $2.5 billion expected in 2022). They also had to dramatically increase their sales force (the biggest expense) to keep up with all this unexpected growth. New employees did not have a chance to be trained properly, but it still worked well as they had demand easily coming to them. Now that there is a very different demand environment, a lot of this salesforce either need to be retrained for normal sales cycles (land and expand) or be replaced. Employee turnover also compounded with a lot of people who were with a company when the stock was going up and up, and now that the stock is down so much from the highs, their stock options are no longer valuable. Having said this, we are not sure any other CEO could have done a better job managing through such a difficult operating environment…read more10. Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40  Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) provides a unified communications platform in the Americas, the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. On November 7, AMC Theaters, an American movie theater chain, announced that it has made a partnership with Zoom Video to turn some AMC locations throughout the US into Zoom meeting rooms. Zoom Rooms at AMC will be available in up to 17 major US markets in 2023.On November 22, Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan kept a Buy rating on Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) stock and lowered the price target to $102 from $118, noting that the company showed below-consensus fiscal fourth-quarter sales guidance and management’s intimations for F2024 growth were modest.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, St. Petersburg, Florida-based investment firm ARK Investment Management is a leading shareholder in Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) with 10.9 million shares worth more than $801.5 million. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Horos Asset Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“What about the other asset class that has attracted the most attention from the investment community in recent times? Here we can distinguish three major groups. First, those companies without earnings that had convinced investors of their great future growth prospects, pushing up their valuations to irrational levels. A clear example of this, which we mentioned almost two years ago is Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) (“Zoom”), whose market cap exceeded that of companies such as IBM or came close to that of Cisco Systems. Well, from the time we wrote about this odd situation until today, Zoom shares have collapsed by nearly 80%.Therefore, if interest rates rise (or are expected to rise), company valuations are negatively impacted. This is especially true for those businesses that generate little cash today and the market expects them to generate a lot of cash in the future. Hence the severe losses in companies that promised a lot of cash generation in the future (such as Zoom).”9. Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53  Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) operates as a cloud services provider that delivers a range of services to businesses worldwide. On December 13, Cloudflare announced a Project Safekeeping program to provide zero trust security solutions free of charge to medium-sized and small critical infrastructure organizations. The company said that this program is designed to protect under-resourced critical infrastructure organizations against cyberattacks and data breaches.On November 4, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg maintained an Outperform rating on Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) stock and lowered the price target to $60 from $74, noting that the company continues to navigate the macro environment and looks more resilient than most.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 53 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $629 million in Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), compared to 41 in the preceding quarter worth $541 million. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We continued to build our position in Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) during the quarter as the shares declined with the overall software space and the long-term risk/ reward balance became more compelling. The company reported a strong second quarter, with revenue growth accelerating to 54%, as well as better gross and operating margins. Third-quarter guidance was also ahead of Wall Street expectations. Given Cloudflare’s proprietary network and massive global scale, its software products have a disruptive price-performance advantage over competitors. As the company introduces new products as well as disruptive packaging/pricing, its unit-level economics should continue to improve over time, with the company already well ahead of its long-term gross margin target of 74%, reporting 78.9% for the second quarter. This drives strong cross/upselling activity with customers, reflected in strong net-dollar expansion rates of more than 125%. Indeed, in the most recent quarters, customers purchasing five or more products reached 81% of the base, six or more products reached 70% of the base, and seven or more products reached 58% of the base. Enterprise penetration continues to be a key long-term driver, with 1,749 customers now spending over $100,000 annually with the company, growing 61% and now accounting for over 60% of total revenue. With approximately 152,000 paying customers at the end of last quarter, large enterprise customers still represent just 1% of total paid customers and thus a material growth opportunity in the coming years. We continue to have high confidence in the company’s ability to innovate at a rapid pace (announced 20 new products or enhancements in September alone), package and bundle with disruptive pricing, and take material share in its large and growing addressable markets.”8. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62      Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is a commerce company that provides a commerce platform and services worldwide. On November 29, Shopify Inc announced record-setting sales for Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend with a sales tally of $7.5 billion from independent businesses worldwide. The sales were up 19% from the sales generated during Shopify's Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend in 2021.On December 9, SMBC Nikko analyst Andrew Bauch maintained an Outperform rating on Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) stock and raised the price target to $45 from $40, noting that the company is one of the few names with the potential to accelerate sales growth and expand margins simultaneously in 2023.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, St. Petersburg, Florida-based investment firm ARK Investment Management is a leading shareholder in Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) with 14.5 million shares worth more than $391.5 million.  In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Artisan Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is a leading e-commerce platform supporting over 2 million merchants with software, online storefronts and payments technology. Like Uber, Shopify returned to the mid-cap territory during Q2 as the company’s profit cycle and share price faced significant pressure. Earlier this year, the company began a phase of investments to support a range of future growth drivers, including Shopify Plus for larger brands, logistics services, international expansion, point-of-sale payments and social media-based commerce. With high inflation putting pressure on consumer spending, and with e-commerce activity normalizing after a massive pandemic spike, Shopify’s earnings have fallen sharply. While we have outstanding questions about the likelihood of success for the company’s capital-intensive logistics investments, we decided to take advantage of the stock’s &gt;75% YTD decline and initiate a GardenSM position at a deep discount to our PMV estimate. Our thesis is predicated on our belief there is still a long runway for commerce to move online, and Shopify is well-positioned to win a share of this market. The company has created an ecosystem of products (payment processing, financing, shipping, customer engagement tools, etc.), partners (TikTok, Google, Meta), sales channels and over 6,000 apps to help its merchants sell online and establish direct relationships with customers.”7. Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74   Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) provides a monitoring and analytics platform for developers, information technology operations teams, and business users in the cloud in North America and internationally. On November 3, Datadog revealed that it acquired Cloudcraft, a visualization service to create real-time diagrams of cloud infrastructures. The company plans to continue offering Cloudcraft to existing and new customers. It will also enhance its capabilities by integrating with the Datadog platform.On December 14, Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron upgraded Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) to Outperform from Perform with a $105 price target.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management LLC is a leading shareholder in Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) with 5.8 million shares worth more than $512.7 million. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Similarly, we continued scaling up our investment in Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG), recognizing significant opportunities for the long term, while the majority of investors remain preoccupied with the here and now. While the company may see some short-term headwinds to growth (the company reported seeing some impact to its volume-driven logs and Application Performance Management modules), long-term prospects remain bright, in our view. Datadog reported a best-in-class gross retention rate in the “mid-to-high 90s%,” 74% year-over-year revenue growth, and 21% adjusted operating margins.”6. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75   Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) creates tools that enable sellers to accept card payments and provide reporting and analytics and next-day settlement. On November 16, Block revealed that its Square payment systems for business will launch a new credit in collaboration with American Express. This credit card would be specifically launched for small businesses which use the company’s payment system.On December 12, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev maintained a Neutral rating on Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) stock and raised the price target to $70 from $69, noting the 2023 outlook for sub-sectors in the group against a backdrop of higher rates, high inflation, and a slowing macro. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, St. Petersburg, Florida-based investment firm ARK Investment Management is a leading shareholder in Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) with 9.2 million shares worth more than $505.5 million. In addition to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is one of the best TaaS stocks to buy now according to elite investors. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While the integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block’s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best TaaS Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:15 Biggest Endowments in the US10 Best BDC Stocks To BuyTop 13 Gas Tanker Shipping Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

Three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading, we have Starbucks, and Nike, RiteAid. Josh Schafer here to help us break all these stocks down. Let's first kick it off with Starbucks. That stock getting downgraded by Jefferies today, although you can see shares holding onto gains, slightly trading to the upside.Now the firm moving to the sidelines on this name but maintaining its $100 price target, slightly higher from where we're trading today. Warning, though, that the company is going to, quote, ""tread water for some time."" High inflation is one of the big headwinds as consumers adjust spending habits. Now Jefferies expects 7% same store sales growth in fiscal 2023 and 5% growth in fiscal 2024. Putting this all in perspective, just shy of consensus estimates.Now it has been a little bit of a tough year here for Starbucks in the red. Year to date you could see losses off just about 15%, so pretty much in line with the broader market here, Josh. But certainly a concern here from Jefferies that the weakening macro environment could be a challenge for Starbucks, at least in the coming quarter or two.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, and I thought it was interesting, when you look at that year-to-date chart too, Jefferies mentioned that from May up, Starbucks' stock has been up about 40% since then. So it's a little bit of just kind of a valuation call in the sense of they just think the stock's currently at fair value. And that's sort of what the street consensus is right now too. The street consensus price target is $98.78. Look at Starbucks stock today. It's almost exactly $98.78. So I think people are just starting to level out there that they think Starbucks' stock is right at fair value.]"

He downgraded Starbucks this morning, warning of recession risks, but picked McDonald's as a favorite going into the new year. The food and drink space is where we find Sozzi's Take today. Let's start with Mickey D's.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, a lot of information to unpack here from Andy Barish. Really good note here. So Barish is bullish on McDonald's, one of his top picks for next year. So let's tick through this. First, same store sales really did well in the 2008, 2009 recession. That is part of Barish's call here that a company like McDonald's-- there I am with my McDonald's hat on-- they're very, very cool-- will do well in a recession as consumers trade down.Now he's also saying that same store sales really did well coming out of the 2008, 2009 recession. So that is a good. Perhaps if we enter a recession in the middle of next year and we come out of it in the latter part, that might benefit McDonald's, at least according to how the 2008, 2009 recession handed down. And as I just mentioned, people trade down historically to McDonald's in tough economic times.Why? Because the food is still relatively cheap despite inflation. And here, you can see that chart from Barish here going back showing those sales outperforming, relatively speaking. The broader restaurant industry during that period of the 2008, 2009 recession. McDonald's doing pretty well during the recession and coming out of the recession.Barish saying that through 2024, he thinks McDonald's brand relevancy led by valuing convenience to support same store sales and profitability outperformance versus peers. McDonald's looking pretty good in a potential US recession next year.BRAD SMITH: OK, and so where is Barish bearish?Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: Bearish. Well, he's not too keen on Starbucks putting out a lengthy, I would say, downgrade report on Starbucks. Really the opposite of the play on McDonald's here that a recession could impact Starbucks in a big way as consumers trade down from that brand. Perhaps maybe they go over to a Dunkin' brands or if they just make their own coffee at home. And then--JULIE HYMAN: What?BRIAN SOZZI: Right, I know. Right? Go figure, people making their own coffee at home instead of spending 12 bucks on Starbucks. But also noting that the shares are a little bit pricey from a valuation level right now. Thinks recession will hurt the company's sales. Also another analyst noting that or just thinking that Starbucks set its expectations for its financials too high at its recent investor day.Now on the positive side, China reopening should benefit a company like Starbucks. It didn't really benefit a company like Nike in the most recent quarter, but still might benefit from Starbucks next year. My take here, to tie this all in a bow, in a recession, cheap burgers ultimately win, $8 coffees do not. And I think that fits or just jives very well in what we've seen in past periods of recession. Consumers just cut these things out and look for cheaper alternatives.JULIE HYMAN: Hm.BRAD SMITH: All right, little luxuries in one way or another, perhaps. Value versus luxury.]"

Despite these factors, there are players in the food universe that have depicted a splendid run on the bourses, driven by their robust pricing endeavors to combat cost inflation.Food companies have been grappling with an increased cost of ingredients, packaging and transportation. The increased cost of labor due to shortages has also been concerning. To counter these headwinds, players have been resorting to raising product prices, and undertaking stronger saving and restructuring measures. These, combined with favorable consumer demand, have been working as a win-win for several companies.Elevated at-home consumption habits formed since the pandemic has been benefiting food companies’ retail operations. Their foodservice businesses have also been witnessing increased sales, with people heading out and getting back to routine. Companies have been making the most of the rising demand through constant brand-building efforts, including innovation and acquisitions.All said, we have pointed out four food stocks, which have rallied more than 25% this year. These stocks are well-placed to continue with their solid momentum on the back of their strong brand images and efficient pricing actions, which are much needed in the current inflationary scenario. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research 4 Stocks Worth a LookArcher Daniels Midland Company ADM has seen its shares rise 37.5% this year.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this investment bank have returned -10.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.5% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Goldman belongs, has lost 4.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Goldman is expected to post earnings of $6.80 per share, indicating a change of -37.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.7% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $33.53 points to a change of -43.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $37.95 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Goldman is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Goldman is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Goldman, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.23 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -11.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $47.62 billion and $51.38 billion estimates indicate -19.8% and +7.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGoldman reported revenues of $11.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12%. EPS of $8.25 for the same period compares with $14.93 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.37%. The EPS surprise was +10.44%.Over the last four quarters, Goldman surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Goldman is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Goldman. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Don't Ignore These 2 Oils-Energy Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-140002440.html,1671631202,STORY,"['OKE', 'SLB']","[Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Schlumberger (SLB) earns a Zacks Rank #1 30 days from its next quarterly earnings release on January 20, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.72 a share.Schlumberger's Earnings ESP sits at 4.38%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.72 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.69.SLB is just one of a large group of Oils-Energy stocks with a positive ESP figure. Oneok Inc. (OKE) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Oneok Inc. is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 27, 2023. OKE's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.06 a share 68 days from its next earnings release.For Oneok Inc. the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01 is 4.77%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, SLB and OKE could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Schlumberger Ltd. SLB, Halliburton Co. HAL, W. R. Berkley Corp. WRB, Enphase Energy Inc. ENPH and Deere &amp; Co. DE.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks Flying High with More Upside in 2023U.S. stock markets are in the grip of volatility once again. Wall Street continued to suffer in the last two weeks after the Fed announced a 50-basis point interest rate hike, with losses deepening. Stocks took a further hit as disappointing retail sales for November sparked fears of a slowing economy.Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 9.9%, 19.9% and 32.6%. On Dec 19, these three stock indexes closed at their lowest levels in five weeks.U.S. stock markets are likely to remain volatile in the near future. Market participants are not sure in which direction the U.S. stock markets will move and are skeptical of a year-end rally — popularly known as Santa Claus Rally — for this year.On Dec 19, the S&amp;P 500 Index — popularly known as the broad-market index — closed at 3,817.66. At this level, the benchmark Index is currently trading well below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 3,863.82 and 4,027.12, respectively. The 50 DMA and the 200 DMA are known as short-term and long-term support lines. This indicates that the index may see a further decline in the near future.However, not all S&amp;P 500 stocks are suffering. Several stocks from this stable are flying high in a highly disappointing 2022. We have selected five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that have more upside left for 2023. These five stocks are as follows:Story continuesSchlumberger Ltd. is the largest oilfield services player, with a presence in every energy market across the globe. Being the leading provider of technology for complex oilfields, SLB is better positioned to take up new offshore projects in international markets.The significant improvement in oil prices is aiding its overall business. Schlumberger reported strong first-quarter results, driven by strong drilling activities in North America, Latin America and the Middle East. SLB is targeting net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.Schlumberger has an expected earnings growth rate of 40.9% for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings improved 1.3% over the last 30 days. The stock price of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) SLB has climbed 66.4% year to date. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Halliburton Co. provides products and services to the energy industry worldwide. High commodity prices have increased demand for HAL's services in North America, to which it is heavily exposed.In particular, Halliburton's key Completion &amp; Production unit margins are likely to improve, with management expecting better pricing leverage going forward. Besides, Halliburton's strong free cash flow generating ability indicates its financial strength.HAL's healthy relationship with national oil companies and digitization efforts also bode well. The increasing cloud-based data flow between sites and back office translates into expanded margins for Halliburton.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Halliburton has an expected earnings growth rate of 41.9% for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 2.1% over the last 30 days. The stock price of HAL has rallied 57.7% year to date.W. R. Berkley Corp. has been benefiting from its insurance business, performing well on the increase in premiums written over the past many years. W. R. Berkley has been investing in numerous startups since 2006 and has established new units in growing international markets.W. R. Berkley's international business is poised for growth supported by emerging markets. WRB's solid capital position enables capital deployment. Investment in alternative assets should help improve investment income going forward.Zacks Rank #2 W. R. Berkley has an expected earnings growth rate of 11.5% for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 1.1% over the last 30 days. The stock price of WRB has surged 30.2% year to date.Enphase Energy Inc. has revolutionized the solar industry by pioneering a semiconductor-based microinverter, which converts energy at the individual solar module level. ENPH enjoys a strong position as a leading U.S. manufacturer of microinverters.Enphase Energy is striving to expand in Europe steadily throughout 2022. Such expansion plans may boost its long-term growth in the battery storage market. ENPH has also been making acquisitions to boost its long-term growth. It holds a strong solvency position.Zacks Rank #2 Enphase Energy has an expected earnings growth rate of 25.8% for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 2.4% over the last 30 days. The stock price of ENPH has jumped 66.7% year to date.Deere &amp; Co. is poised well to gain on improving commodity prices, which will encourage farmers to spend more on farm equipment. Strong replacement demand will also continue to boost DE's top line. Demand for Construction equipment will likely benefit from anticipated growth in infrastructure investments. We expect Deere's adjusted earnings per share to grow 16% in fiscal 2023, led by strong demand and pricing.Product launches equipped with the latest technology to make farming automated will continue to provide DE with an edge over its competitors. DE will benefit in the long run from rapid growth in the global population as well as the rising worldwide infrastructure needs.Zacks Rank #2 Deere has an expected earnings growth rate of 19.2% for the current year (ending October 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings improved 1.7% over the last seven days. The stock price of DE has advanced 26.2% year to date.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

It is one of the largest natural gas producers in the United States. As the price of natural gas has skyrocketed over the past few months, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the rising commodity price.EQT Corp has a massive inventory of drilling locations in the core Appalachian Basin, which could provide significant production volumes. At 2021-end, the company had total proved reserves of 25 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe), up 26% from the 2020 levels of 19.8 Tcfe.EQT Corp is uniquely positioned to take an active role in addressing climate change. Being a leading natural gas producer, the firm emits lower greenhouse gases compared with major oil-producing companies. Of the total GHG emission reductions in the United States since 2005, the contribution of EQT is roughly 5%. By 2025, it aims to achieve net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.The upstream energy player has lower exposure to debt capital than composite stocks belonging to the industry. EQT Corp raised its 2023 year-end debt reduction target to $4 billion from $2.5 billion. Hence, the company can rely on its strong balance sheet to sail through the volatility in commodity prices.Apart from accelerating the reduction of its debt load, EQT is focused on generating strong free cash flows and rewarding its shareholders. The company doubled its 2022-2023 share buyback program to $2 billion. The firm is anticipating generating more than $5.6 billion of free cash flow through 2023 from 2022. As the scope of free cash flow generation looks promising, EQT is expecting ample room to reward shareholders with dividend hikes.Story continuesRisksEQT Corp’s lack of geographic diversification is concerning since the majority of its asset base is located in the Appalachian Basin. As such, it is more vulnerable to basin-specific delays and interruptions in production from wells, which can potentially hamper growth.Key PicksInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at the following companies that presently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.MPLX LP MPLX is a master limited partnership that provides a wide range of midstream energy services, including fuel distribution solutions.

MPLX’s distribution per unit was 77.5 cents for the third quarter, indicating a 10% hike from the prior distribution of 70.5 cents.Murphy USA Inc. MUSA is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States. MUSA’s third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $9.28 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.82.Murphy USA is expected to see an earnings surge of 80.9% in 2022. In more good news for investors, MUSA’s board of directors recently declared a quarterly cash dividend of 35 cents per share to its common shareholders, marking a 9% sequential increase.Phillips 66 PSX is the leading player in each of its operations, like refining, chemicals and midstream, in terms of size, efficiency and strengths. PSX’s third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $6.46 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.98.PSX is expected to see an earnings rise of 251% in 2022. Phillips 66’s board of directors authorized a $5-billion increase to its stock repurchase program, bringing the total share repurchases authorized since 2012 to $20 billion.

The greenback was also dented by growing bets that U.S. inflation has peaked, which could invite a slower pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.Spot gold rose 0.2% to $1,818.58 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,827.45 an ounce by 20:08 ET (01:08 GMT). The yellow metal was trading up 1.5% for the week, and was close to a five-month high.Markets are now awaiting revised U.S. GDP data for the third quarter. A preliminary reading showed that the economy grew a better-than-expected 2.9% in the September quarter, with analysts forecasting the figure to remain the same in its first revision due later in the day.Focus this week is squarely on the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditure price index, which is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge. The core index is expected to have eased further in November from the prior month.But the index still remains well above the Fed’s annual target range, indicating that the central bank still needs to tighten policy further to curb inflation.The prospect of rising interest rates in developed markets is likely to keep gold prices subdued in the coming months, with the Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and the Bank of England also sending hawkish messages.Other precious metals rose on Thursday, although their outlook also remains clouded. Focus this week is also on consumer inflation data from Japan, especially after the BOJ somewhat tightened policy after nearly a decade of accommodative measures.Among industrial metals, copper prices surged on more signs of an economic reopening in China, even as the country grapples with a massive spike in COVID-19 cases.Story continuesCopper futures rose 0.7% to $3.8425 a pound and were set to gain over 2% this week.But prices of the red metal are still trading lower for the year, with their outlook remaining uncertain in the face of rising interest rates and a potential recession.Related ArticlesGold holds recent gains as markets await GDP, inflation readingsOil rallies on tight U.S. stocks as winter blast hitsChampagne makers celebrate record sales ahead of Christmas]"

The peso gained 1.8% against the dollar, tracking its best one-day percentage gain in two weeks as prices of the red metal moved higher, shrugging off worries that a recent surge in coronavirus infections in China was reducing consumption in the short term. Chile, which is the world's biggest producer of copper, relies heavily on demand from China, whose zero-COVID policy disrupted economic activity and pulled the industrial metal from a record high. The Chilean currency is on track for its second straight yearly decline, down more than 2%. ""China’s announcement of measures to lower financial costs for businesses adds to the idea that 2023 will be a major recovery year for trade and overcoming the supply-chain woes that have aided inflation worldwide,"" said Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex. Latin American stocks rose 0.6%, outpacing the broader emerging markets. Higher exposure to commodities have helped certain emerging markets more than others, with Latam stocks set to end the year flat against a near-23% plunge in the MSCI's broader EM index . Mexico's peso rose 0.7% tracking firm oil prices. The Colombian peso was subdued on Wednesday and is down 14.6% so far this year, underperforming its regional peers. In Peru, President Dina Boluarte named lawyer Alberto Otarola as the new prime minister as part of a reshuffling of her cabinet. The sol rose 0.1%, while stocks index in Lima was flat. Boluarte was vice president until she replaced then-President Pedro Castillo earlier this month, who was removed from office and then detained after illegally trying to dissolve congress. Peru on Tuesday gave Congress the provisional green light to bring forward a general election to the end of 2023, amid deadly protests over the impeachment of Castillo. ""The approval is positive in the sense that it caters to growing pressures from the population and allows time for potential political reform changes that could limit the common stalemate between congress and executive branches,"" Citi strategists wrote in a client note. Brazil's real edged up against a firm dollar. Data showed the country's federal tax revenue totaled 172.038 billion reais ($33.29 billion) in November, a 3.25% growth in real terms over the same month last year. Sao Paulo stocks rose 0.5%, with a 27.2% jump in Brazilian reinsurer IRB Brasil Resseguros SA leading gains after it posted a monthly profit in October. Argentina's economic activity expanded 4.5% in October from a year earlier, the country's official statistics agency said, in line with a recent Reuters poll. Elsewhere in emerging markets, the Czech crown edged 0.1% up against the euro after the country's National Bank (CNB) held interest rates steady as expected amid signs of peaking inflation.

The OZ board had last month accepted BHP’s offer, and recommended it to shareholders.The deal is also subject to regulatory approvals in Australia, Brazil, Vietnam.After being rejected in its first approach to OZ earlier this year, BHP made a higher cash offer of A$28.25 per share in November, as it looks to enlarge its interests in copper and nickel mining.The move comes as BHP pivots further away from fossil fuels and into what it sees as a future of clean energy.Copper and nickel are integral parts of clean energy infrastructure, and have seen increased demand in recent years amid the growing popularity of electric cars and renewable energy.The deal will position BHP as one of the largest copper producers in the world, with the world’s largest miner forecasting a spike in demand for the red metal in the coming years.OZ Mineral holds projects close to BHP’s Olympic Dam mine in South Australia, which is also why the Anglo-Australian miner is seeking to integrate the firm into its holdings.BHP plans to fund the deal through a mix of cash and by taking on new debt.The deal is the largest mining deal in Australia since BHP’s purchase of Petrohawk Energy Corp in 2011 for $12.1 billion.But BHP has since then sold all of its oil and gas assets to Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum, and has also trimmed the size of its coal businesses. The mining giant also expects demand for its key iron ore exports to plateau in the coming years.Shares of BHP and OZ Minerals were trading slightly higher in early trade.Related ArticlesStory continuesMining giant BHP Group finalizes $6.4 bln offer for OZ MineralsAsia shares join Wall St bounce, yen keeps climbingModerna's vaccine facility in Britain to create over 150 new jobs]"

98,d9262682-8964-3632-a8b1-2146892959ec,M,2022-12-22,BHP Group (BHP) and OZ Minerals Extend Deal Deadline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-group-bhp-oz-minerals-175405956.html,1671645245,STORY,['M'],"[BHP Group BHP recently announced that it has received an extension till Dec 27, 2022 to finalize a binding scheme implementation deed relating to its earlier takeover offer to OZ Minerals Limited.OZ Minerals has a high-quality portfolio of copper and nickel assets, located in a Tier-1 mining jurisdiction with long mine lives and first-quartile cost positioning. BHP made its first offer to acquire 100% of the issued share capital in OZ Minerals Limited for AUD25 per share on Aug 7, 2022. OZ Minerals’ Board had rejected the offer citing that it undervalues the company and was not in the best interests of shareholders.On Nov 18, BHP raised its offer price to A$28.25 per share which represented a 49.3% premium to OZ Minerals’ closing price on Aug 5, 2022 — the last trading day prior to BHP’s initial proposal.OZ Mineral’s board had then confirmed to BHP that it intended to recommend the revised offer to the company’s shareholders. The parties had entered into a Confidentiality and Exclusivity Deed under which BHP had four weeks to undertake due diligence and negotiate a binding scheme implementation agreement reflecting the key terms of the revised proposal. Now that the due diligence has been duly completed, OZ Minerals has extended the period to next week so that BHP can finalize the terms. The terms of the scheme implementation deed however remain subject to both the companies’ Board approval.OZ Minerals owns and operates Prominent Hill, a high-quality copper-gold mine, and Carrapateena, an iron-oxide-copper–gold underground mine, both located in the highly prospective Gawler Craton in South Australia. The Carajás East Hub located in Brazil is also part of its portfolio. This hub comprises the Pedra Branca underground mine, which is the beginning of a potential series of small, high-quality copper-gold mines with ore being processed at existing facilities at the nearby, now-depleted Antas mine.This deal, which values OZ Minerals at AUD9.6 billion ($6.34 billion),  would add to BHP’s pipeline of growth options and enhance its exposure to future-facing commodities like copper and nickel, while adding attractive synergies. BHP has been lately focusing on building its capabilities in commodities like copper, nickel and potash to ride on growing global trends such as decarbonization, electrification, population growth and rising living standards in developing countries among others.The combination will also help BHP unlock potential operational synergies in South Australia as OZ Minerals’ Carrapateena and Prominent Hill mines are in proximity to the Olympic Dam and Oak Dam development resources. OZ Mineral’s West Musgrave project will add a large greenfield nickel option to BHP’s Nickel West premier nickel sulfide resource position in Western Australia.Story continuesPrice PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBHP Group’s shares have gained 3.9% over the past year compared with the industry’s 4.5% decline.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderBHP currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

If you want to read about some more retail stocks, go directly to 5 Best Retail Stocks to Buy Now.As per Retail Global Market Report 2022, the global retail market was valued at roughly $23.65 trillion in 2021. The market is expected to reach a valuation of $26.33 trillion by the end of 2022 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.3%. The market size is forecasted to be worth approximately $38.71 trillion by 2026 at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1%. This growth is attributed to the use of data analytics in management by retailers to enhance supply chain efficiency, streamline operations to engage customers, and build loyalty.Despite the large size of the market itself, some of the leading retail stocks have struggled this year due to an unsteady economic climate brought on by rampant inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain disruptions, and rising inventories. Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has raised the benchmark interest rates five times in response to growing inflation. Currently, inflation is at 40-year highs. The consumer price index (CPI) for October 2022 climbed 7.7% over the previous year, according to a report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on November 10.However, analysts remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of the retail sector and foresee a rebound in the strongest retail stocks during the holiday season. According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), a new record of $942.6 billion is anticipated for holiday retail sales in November and December 2022, up 6-8% from last year. Online and non-store sales are projected to rise by 10-12% to meet the target of $263 billion over the holidays. The organization estimates that each American will spend about $832 on gifts, food, and decorations this year.Therefore, to keep up with the rise in demand during the holidays, retailers have positioned themselves in line with the anticipated shift in customer behavior.

CAAS, Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL, Group 1 Automotive, Inc. GPI and NRG Energy, Inc. NRG.5 Stocks with Impressive EV-to-EBITDA Ratios to Scoop UpThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is broadly considered as the yardstick for evaluating the fair market value of a stock. It is preferred by many investors while handpicking stocks trading at attractive prices. However, even this universally used valuation multiple is not without its limitations.While P/E enjoys huge popularity among value investors, a less-used and more-complicated metric called EV-to-EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative. EV-to-EBITDA gives the true picture of a company's valuation and earnings potential. It has a more comprehensive approach to valuation. Global Partners LP, China Automotive Systems, Inc., Sterling Infrastructure, Inc., Group 1 Automotive, Inc. and NRG Energy, Inc. are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.EV-to-EBITDA is a Better Option, Here's WhyEV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company's market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.EBITDA, the other element of the multiple, gives a better idea of a company's profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Just like P/E, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more attractive it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued. Unlike the P/E ratio, EV-to-EBITDA takes debt on a company's balance sheet into account. For this reason, it is typically used to value potential acquisition targets. The ratio shows the amount of debt that the acquirer has to bear. Stocks flaunting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Story continuesMoreover, P/E can't be used to value a loss-making firm. A firm's earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. In contrast, EV-to-EBITDA is harder to manipulate and can be used to value companies that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA front.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.However, EV-to-EBITDA is not devoid of shortcomings and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock's inherent potential and future performance. The multiple varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital expenditure requirements.Therefore, instead of just relying on EV-to-EBITDA, you can club it with the other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to achieve the desired results.Here are our five picks out of the 13 stocks that passed the screen:Global Partners is focused on the distribution of gasoline, distillates, residual oil and renewable fuels, apart from owning several refined-petroleum-product terminals.

POST is increasing its presence through acquisitions to enhance its portfolio. The consumer-packaged-goods company is benefiting from strategic pricing actions and recovery across Foodservice business. These upsides were seen in its fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, with the top and the bottom line increasing year over year and beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.That being said, Post Holdings is not immune to inflationary headwinds and supply chain-related issues.Let’s delve deeper.Promising Q4 PerformanceIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Post Holdings posted adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 85 cents per share, increasing from the 11 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. POST registered sales of $1,579.1 million, up 16.5%. The upside can be attributed to pricing actions in every segment and ongoing volume recovery across Foodservice business. The company saw sales growth in the Post Consumer Brands and Foodservice segment.We note that Post Holdings has been gaining from strength in the Foodservice business for a while. During the fiscal fourth quarter, Foodservice sales increased 36.9% to $625.5 million. Revenues reflect the effects of inflation-driven pricing actions, the impact of commodity cost pass-through pricing model and avian influenza-driven pricing efforts. Volumes rose 3.6%. Management highlighted that its Foodservice business has completely recovered from COVID and turned profitable.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPrudent Acquisitions Driving GrowthPost Holdings has been focusing on acquisitions, helping it expand its customer base. On Apr 5, 2022, Post Holdings acquired Lacka Foods Limited. Lacka Foods is a U.K.-based marketer of high-protein, ready-to-drink (RTD) shakes under the UFIT brand. Post Holdings acquired Almark Foods (or Almark) on Feb 1, 2021. Almark, which is renowned for its hard-cooked and deviled egg products, provides conventional, organic and cage-free products. Also, on Jan 25, Post Holdings acquired the Peter Pan peanut butter brand. On Jul 1, 2020, the company completed the acquisition of Henningsen Foods, Inc., which forms part of its Foodservice segment. In June 2021, the company stated that it had completed the acquisition of the PL RTE Cereal Business of TreeHouse Foods.Several other companies in the food space, like The Kraft Heinz Company KHC, Hormel Foods Corporation HRL and Tyson Foods, Inc. TSN, are benefiting from acquisitions.In April 2022, Kraft Heinz acquired a majority stake in a Brazil-based condiments and sauces company — Companhia Hemmer Industria e Comercio (""Hemmer""). The buyout widened Kraft Heinz's International Taste Elevation platform and enhanced its presence across emerging markets. In January 2022, KHC acquired an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH (“Just Spices”). The buyout enhanced its direct-to-consumer operations and go-to-market expansion.Hormel Foods is strengthening its business through strategic acquisitions. In June, HRL acquired the Planters snacking portfolio from Kraft Heinz. Prior to this, it acquired Texas-based pit-smoked meats company Sadler's Smokehouse in March 2020. The buyout was in sync with Hormel Foods’ initiatives to strengthen its position in the foodservice space.Tyson Foods is focused on expanding into international markets as part of its strategic growth plan. In Jul 2022, TSN announced its strategic partnership with Tanmiah Food Company (Tanmiah) — a leading Middle East provider of fresh and processed poultry, other processed meat products, animal feed and health products. The acquisitions will allow Tyson Foods to access poultry supplies across Saudi Arabia to cater to the rising protein demand in the Middle East and other markets.Story continuesWhat’s Hampering Post Holdings Performance?In its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call, management highlighted supply chain disruptions eased slightly but continued to drive increased manufacturing costs while customer order fulfillment rates remained lower than optimal levels. The company also faced input and freight inflation in the quarter.In addition, Post Holdings has been seeing a rise in SG&amp;A costs for a while. The company’s SG&amp;A expenses increased 9.9% year over year to $223.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.Yet, the aforementioned upsides will likely keep POST afloat amid such hurdles.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 19% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 12.3%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

110,a59fdfa5-c8ac-3e9d-b073-949d13f84196,MA,2022-12-22,Estimating The Fair Value Of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-mastercard-incorporated-120058832.html,1671710458,STORY,['MA'],"[How far off is Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Mastercard Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$11.9bUS$13.8bUS$15.5bUS$17.8bUS$19.5bUS$21.0bUS$22.2bUS$23.2bUS$24.0bUS$24.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 9.58%Est @ 7.30%Est @ 5.70%Est @ 4.59%Est @ 3.80%Est @ 3.26% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$11.0kUS$11.9kUS$12.4kUS$13.3kUS$13.5kUS$13.5kUS$13.2kUS$12.8kUS$12.4kUS$11.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$126bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$25b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.0%) = US$447bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$447b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$214bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$340b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$346, the company appears about fair value at a 2.1% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mastercard as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.018. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MastercardStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the IT market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

The greenback was also dented by growing bets that U.S. inflation has peaked, which could invite a slower pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.Spot gold rose 0.2% to $1,818.58 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,827.45 an ounce by 20:08 ET (01:08 GMT). The yellow metal was trading up 1.5% for the week, and was close to a five-month high.Markets are now awaiting revised U.S. GDP data for the third quarter. A preliminary reading showed that the economy grew a better-than-expected 2.9% in the September quarter, with analysts forecasting the figure to remain the same in its first revision due later in the day.Focus this week is squarely on the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditure price index, which is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge. The core index is expected to have eased further in November from the prior month.But the index still remains well above the Fed’s annual target range, indicating that the central bank still needs to tighten policy further to curb inflation.The prospect of rising interest rates in developed markets is likely to keep gold prices subdued in the coming months, with the Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and the Bank of England also sending hawkish messages.Other precious metals rose on Thursday, although their outlook also remains clouded. Focus this week is also on consumer inflation data from Japan, especially after the BOJ somewhat tightened policy after nearly a decade of accommodative measures.Among industrial metals, copper prices surged on more signs of an economic reopening in China, even as the country grapples with a massive spike in COVID-19 cases.Story continuesCopper futures rose 0.7% to $3.8425 a pound and were set to gain over 2% this week.But prices of the red metal are still trading lower for the year, with their outlook remaining uncertain in the face of rising interest rates and a potential recession.Related ArticlesGold holds recent gains as markets await GDP, inflation readingsOil rallies on tight U.S. stocks as winter blast hitsChampagne makers celebrate record sales ahead of Christmas]"

The peso gained 1.8% against the dollar, tracking its best one-day percentage gain in two weeks as prices of the red metal moved higher, shrugging off worries that a recent surge in coronavirus infections in China was reducing consumption in the short term. Chile, which is the world's biggest producer of copper, relies heavily on demand from China, whose zero-COVID policy disrupted economic activity and pulled the industrial metal from a record high. The Chilean currency is on track for its second straight yearly decline, down more than 2%. ""China’s announcement of measures to lower financial costs for businesses adds to the idea that 2023 will be a major recovery year for trade and overcoming the supply-chain woes that have aided inflation worldwide,"" said Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex. Latin American stocks rose 0.6%, outpacing the broader emerging markets. Higher exposure to commodities have helped certain emerging markets more than others, with Latam stocks set to end the year flat against a near-23% plunge in the MSCI's broader EM index . Mexico's peso rose 0.7% tracking firm oil prices. The Colombian peso was subdued on Wednesday and is down 14.6% so far this year, underperforming its regional peers. In Peru, President Dina Boluarte named lawyer Alberto Otarola as the new prime minister as part of a reshuffling of her cabinet. The sol rose 0.1%, while stocks index in Lima was flat. Boluarte was vice president until she replaced then-President Pedro Castillo earlier this month, who was removed from office and then detained after illegally trying to dissolve congress. Peru on Tuesday gave Congress the provisional green light to bring forward a general election to the end of 2023, amid deadly protests over the impeachment of Castillo. ""The approval is positive in the sense that it caters to growing pressures from the population and allows time for potential political reform changes that could limit the common stalemate between congress and executive branches,"" Citi strategists wrote in a client note. Brazil's real edged up against a firm dollar. Data showed the country's federal tax revenue totaled 172.038 billion reais ($33.29 billion) in November, a 3.25% growth in real terms over the same month last year. Sao Paulo stocks rose 0.5%, with a 27.2% jump in Brazilian reinsurer IRB Brasil Resseguros SA leading gains after it posted a monthly profit in October. Argentina's economic activity expanded 4.5% in October from a year earlier, the country's official statistics agency said, in line with a recent Reuters poll. Elsewhere in emerging markets, the Czech crown edged 0.1% up against the euro after the country's National Bank (CNB) held interest rates steady as expected amid signs of peaking inflation.

The OZ board had last month accepted BHP’s offer, and recommended it to shareholders.The deal is also subject to regulatory approvals in Australia, Brazil, Vietnam.After being rejected in its first approach to OZ earlier this year, BHP made a higher cash offer of A$28.25 per share in November, as it looks to enlarge its interests in copper and nickel mining.The move comes as BHP pivots further away from fossil fuels and into what it sees as a future of clean energy.Copper and nickel are integral parts of clean energy infrastructure, and have seen increased demand in recent years amid the growing popularity of electric cars and renewable energy.The deal will position BHP as one of the largest copper producers in the world, with the world’s largest miner forecasting a spike in demand for the red metal in the coming years.OZ Mineral holds projects close to BHP’s Olympic Dam mine in South Australia, which is also why the Anglo-Australian miner is seeking to integrate the firm into its holdings.BHP plans to fund the deal through a mix of cash and by taking on new debt.The deal is the largest mining deal in Australia since BHP’s purchase of Petrohawk Energy Corp in 2011 for $12.1 billion.But BHP has since then sold all of its oil and gas assets to Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum, and has also trimmed the size of its coal businesses. The mining giant also expects demand for its key iron ore exports to plateau in the coming years.Shares of BHP and OZ Minerals were trading slightly higher in early trade.Related ArticlesStory continuesMining giant BHP Group finalizes $6.4 bln offer for OZ MineralsAsia shares join Wall St bounce, yen keeps climbingModerna's vaccine facility in Britain to create over 150 new jobs]"

117,d27b118d-57e0-337d-8bbd-48c3099f8535,QCOM,2022-12-22,"Tech stocks had a rough year. Apple, Microsoft, and Qualcomm did slightly better.",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tech-stocks-had-rough-apple-154447710.html,1671637487,VIDEO,"['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'QCOM']","[Yahoo Finance’s Daniel Howley joins the Live show to discuss the best tech stocks of 2022, which include Apple and Microsoft.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: It's been a rough year for tech, to say the least. And while it's been a sea of pain across the board for the sector, we are taking a look at the tech names in 2022 that have done better than its competitors, making it the best-ish performers of the year. With all the details here now, we've got Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. Dan.DAN HOWLEY: That's right, Brad. Yeah, not a great year for tech by any stretch of the imagination. Not a good year for the S&amp;P 500 at all. But there are some companies that manage to do, as you said, better than others. They're bad and then the worst. So these are the best-ish kind of companies. We obviously have Apple, Microsoft, and Qualcomm. Let's start off with Apple, which, year to date, as of the close on the 20th, had a whopping negative 25.49% on its stock price. And so, not great.This isn't something you would normally have as a best of the year, but still, as far as the tech basket that we looked at goes, this was the top performer. And if you want to talk about why Apple did well, its Q1 had record revenue. It continued to do well throughout the year, posting record quarters for each subsequent quarter on the power of the iPhone sales.We know that towards the end of the year, there were those disruptions as far as protests at the plant over in China, where they make the iPhone Pro, the iPhone 14 Pro. That caused some slowdowns in the ability for iPhones to get into consumers' hands. And then we had heard that Apple was also telling its manufacturers to slow down the production of the iPhone 14+, just because people simply weren't that interested in it. So it's been rough going for Apple, as it has been the rest of the sector.But as far as the basket that we looked at, it could have been a lot worse. After Apple, we also have Microsoft, another, obviously, big stalwart in the tech space. They continue to do well as far as their cloud offerings go, the Azure platform being the main standout there.Story continuesBut the problem was that they started to see year over year growth slow as far as that all important business goes. They still managed to do very well. We obviously had the cloud up 20% year over year in Q1 fiscal 2023. That's their most recent quarter. Their calendar is all sorts of mixed up. So they aren't doing exactly bad, but they did manage to beat out the likes of Amazon and Google as far as the cloud business goes. And so they're one of our best-ish.And then finally, surprisingly, a chip company, we have Qualcomm. While Intel, AMD, Nvidia were all basically dogs for the year, Qualcomm managed to do relatively well. And the reason for that has to do with a number of things, chief among them the fact that they're trying to diversify outside of relying so heavily on the handset space. So they're getting into servers. They're getting into PCs. They're getting into automotive. And they've been doing this for some time, but they seem to be stepping it up a lot more.The other thing had to do with the fact that their 5G chips are going to continue to be in Apple's iPhones. They originally were only expecting to provide roughly 20% of the chips for iPhones next year. Now they're going to be somewhere around 100%. And that has to do with the fact that Apple simply hasn't been able to get the technology to where they want it to be. Qualcomm's already got it, so why not just go ahead and continue to use there? So for the year, these are the three-- I mean, it's just laughable-- best-ish tech stocks that we've managed to pull together. We'll have the worst tomorrow, and my God, those are bad.JULIE HYMAN: I don't know. I'm bracing myself for that. I mean--DAN HOWLEY: They're rough.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I mean, I'm looking at the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, and every single component in there was down on the year. How are these company executives, how are analysts, how are investors feeling after this year that they have had?DAN HOWLEY: It's interesting. It's because we obviously have talked about these trends that we've seen where PC sales down, smartphone sales. People are starting to pull back a little bit. The big spenders, the businesses, they're starting to pull back a little bit, just because of inflationary pressures. The idea that maybe we're going into recession, that seems to change that narrative every day. But that seems to be the big issue for a lot of these companies. That, and we had the huge problems with supply during the pandemic era.Now there's just too much inventory because people aren't buying enough of them. They already put all of these products out there. So they're trying to get rid of all that extra channel inventory. So that's really the main discussion that we're seeing overall. But I think going forward, they're a lot more upbeat than you otherwise might think, considering the numbers that we're seeing.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I wouldn't expect very much upbeat at all, given those returns. Thanks so much, Dan Howley. Appreciate it.]"
118,9488df36-67f4-311f-a599-7176e28ec276,QCOM,2022-12-22,Here is What to Know Beyond Why QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-qualcomm-incorporated-140002511.html,1671631202,STORY,['QCOM'],"[Qualcomm (QCOM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -9.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, which Qualcomm falls in, has lost 6.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $2.36 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -26.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.19 points to a change of -18.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.29 indicates a change of +20.6% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Qualcomm.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for QCOM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $9.6 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -10.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $40.07 billion and $45.91 billion estimates indicate -9.3% and +14.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryQualcomm reported revenues of $11.4 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $3.13 for the same period compares with $2.55 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.38 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.13%. The EPS surprise was +0.32%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Qualcomm is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The memorable anti-war lyrics make a powerful point about the cost of war: “War, I despise, cause it means destruction of innocent lives, war means tears to thousands of mother’s eyes…War, huh, yeah, What is it good for? Absolutely nothing.”While it is tough to argue with the song’s sentiment from a human perspective, war can benefit the economy and defense stocks. Think back to the late 1930s when the unemployment rate in the U.S. reached nosebleed levels of 25%. How did the nation claw its way out of the Great Depression? World War II. After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, America was dragged into the war and began a massive mobilization effort. Companies such as Ford Motor F retooled their factories to support the effort leading to an enormous recovery in unemployment and leaps in manufacturing innovation.Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, defense stocks took off as the U.S. began its Middle East war efforts. Names such as Lockheed Martin LMT trended for months even as the U.S. market suffered from the post-internet bubble blues and the fallout from the Twin Tower attacks. While the U.S is not in a “hot war” currently, America’s involvement in the war in Ukraine is bolstering the performance of domestic defense contractors.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Defense names have drastically outperformed the S&amp;P (red), as Ukraine war drags on.As the war drags on in Europe, Ukrainian President Zelenskiy is expected to travel to Washington to address congress. At the same time, President Joe Biden is expected to announce $2 billion more in military funding to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russian President Putin warned this week that Russia has “no limitations” on spending for the war. In other words, pending any drastic changes, such as peace talks, the conflict looks destined to drag on.Though the Aerospace – Defense industry is a low ranked industry group, and most defense stocks have mid-tier Zack’s Rankings, new spending could bolster consensus EPS estimates in the coming months. The primary defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics Corp GD, Raytheon Technologies RTX, and Northrup Grumman NOC should all benefit. From a valuation perspective, GD, RTX, LMT, and NOC have similar forward P/E ratios between 17 – 23. However, Lockheed separated itself from the pack with its technical setup and relative price performance.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: LMT chart looks strong from a technical perspective as it consolidates in a bull flag above its 50-day moving average.Lockheed Martin has been outperforming the general market and its peers by a wide margin over the past few months. The stock is consolidating near highs in a bull flag and looking to get support at its rising 50-day moving average.

Some of these developments can be attributed to Lockheed Martin that paved the way for the company to secure valuable helicopter-related contracts in recent times. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.With the fiscal 2023 defense budget offering investment potential worth $56.5 billion in aircraft, we expect Lockheed Martin’s Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) business segment, which comprises the Sikorsky helicopters, to benefit.Helicopter Market ProspectsThe global attack helicopter market is estimated to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during the 2020-2025 period, per the latest forecast made by market research firm, Mordor Intelligence.

The award has been offered by Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA.Details of the DealValued at $2.02 billion, the contract is expected to be completed by December 2027. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will provide system upgrades for the F/A-18 and EA-18G aircraft, which include Foreign Military Sales (FMS) variants.The jet giant will also offer deliverables and services based on systems configuration set requirements consisting of all software and hardware required to implement new capabilities on the aforementioned aircraft.The majority of work related to this deal will be executed in St. Louis, MO. The contract will serve the U.S. Navy and FMS customers.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Story continuesPer a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during the 2022-2028 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense.

126,747f2a4d-f1b8-3cd9-9bdd-ad0830ddfee2,JNJ,2022-12-22,Is Trending Stock Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-johnson-johnson-jnj-140002739.html,1671631202,STORY,['JNJ'],"[Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned -0.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Johnson &amp; Johnson falls in, has gained 4.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.22 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.04 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.28 indicates a change of +2.4% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Johnson &amp; Johnson is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for JNJ _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.79 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $95.02 billion and $98.34 billion estimates indicate +1.3% and +3.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $23.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.9%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $2.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.2%. The EPS surprise was +2.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The high volume of global economic activities has heightened the demand for recycling of waste materials. The recycling sector has become an integral part of the urban infrastructure since it ensures the protection of both the human health and environment. In addition to higher urbanization and the expanding industrial sector, the growing agricultural production leads to more wastage from the agro-industries, thus driving the demand for the waste recycling services across the globe. There are new entrants looking to resolve the lags in the waste management and recycling industry. For example, solar panels are considered green hardware, but older versions of panels are turning into hazardous waste. Thus, a California-based startup, SolarCycle, is using that waste by recycling parts of the older panels and disposing them off for profit. SolarCycle asserts that it can cheaply extract about 95% of the important materials in solar panels, like silver, silicon, copper, and aluminum. These can then be recycled or repurposed, resulting in an efficient circular solar economy.Some of the best recycling stocks to invest in include Waste Connections, Inc. (NYSE:WCN), Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM), and Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE:RSG). Our Methodology We selected the following recycling stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022.

As a leading national provider of waste and recycling solutions, Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) is ""differentiated"" by its asset-light, national footprint, and ability to handle comprehensive waste streams, the analyst told investors. He noted that the company has also developed ""valuable"" data warehousing capabilities, offering full waste-stream services for its clients.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 9 hedge funds were long Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) at the end of September 2022, with collective stakes worth $29.5 million, compared to 7 funds in the prior quarter worth $14.7 million. Nelson Obus’ Wynnefield Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 2.5 million shares worth $21.7 million. Here is what Long Cast Advisor specifically said about Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC)  in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) borrowed heavily to purchase Rome RWS, Inc., and with results from the acquired company not yet fully on the income statement, the debt ratios expanded and equity valuations declined. Management – and really the Board – is undertaking a high skill maneuver of integrating its largest acquisition to date, carrying an unprecedented level of debt all concurrent with the long planned retirement of the long tenured CFO. It’s a little more exciting than necessary but the valuation is undemanding and the opportunity set is quite large.Since I’ve long written about what this company could look like if it leaned more deeply into utilizing technology within its two-sided marketplace, I’ll be closely following the XPO Logistics (XPO) spinoff of the truck brokerage business, expected in 4Q22. Truck and waste brokerage share some similar dynamics and as I’ve long noted, the technologist at XPO worked at Oakleaf concurrently with QRHC CEO Ray Hatch. Technology was a big enabling factor at Oakleaf and in XPO’s +10x growth. I think it would have a similar function for QRHC were management to wisely invest time and resources in its development.”9. Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE:LICY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE:LICY) is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, and the company engages in the lithium-ion battery resource recovery and lithium-ion battery recycling business in North America.

(NYSE:LICY) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $7.50 from $8. The analyst observed that while there is an inclination to go back to cyclical chemical names after having lagged in 2022, he has decided to ""stay defensive"" going into 2023. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 15 hedge funds were long Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE:LICY) at the end of September 2022, and Zilvinas Mecelis’ Covalis Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 11.6 million shares worth $61.8 million. 8.

Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) is one of the leading recycling stocks to invest in. On October 19, Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) reported Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.01 and a revenue of $172.22 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.21 and $17.23 million, respectively. The Q3 revenue increased nearly 40% compared to the prior-year quarter. Needham analyst James Ricchiuti on October 21 maintained a Buy rating on Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) but trimmed the firm's price target on the shares to $40 from $43 as he noted that the company delivered ""another impressive quarterly report."" Oil business margins are forecasted to shrink in Q4 as a result of downtime in Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI)’s refinery, which may have contributed to the pullback in shares, but it is ""unwarranted,"" the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 19 hedge funds were long Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) at the end of September 2022, compared to 16 funds in the last quarter. Chuck Royce’s Royce &amp; Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.15 million shares worth $34 million. Meridian Funds made the following comment about Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) is an environmental services company focused on machine parts cleaning, used oil collection, oil re-refining, and hazardous and non-hazardous waste services. Our rationale for investing in this company includes the recurring revenue stream it generates from its environmental services business unit and substantial growth opportunities in the re-refinery and used oil collection segments. Continued strong execution and higher oil prices contributed to the stock’s solid performance during the period. Notably, Heritage-Crystal Clean’s oil business segment generated record revenue in the second quarter and saw segment margins improve to 41%, as the spread between base oil sales and the cost of collecting used oil widened. The company’s core environmental services segment also recorded record quarterly revenue. We believe the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) story at Heritage remains under appreciated by the market as the company collects used motor oil and recycles it for reuse. We have high conviction in the long-term growth story for the company, but trimmed our position in the stock during the period as the share price appreciated.”7. PureCycle Technologies, Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the sector and go directly to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Biotechnology.The Covid-19 pandemic has awoken the world to its vulnerability to airborne viruses whose outbreaks are extremely hard to contain. It certainly wasn’t the last pandemic, as a Nature study shows how loss of biodiversity is likely to increase the frequency of viral outbreaks. However, the pandemic was also an occasion that showcased the global biotechnological capability, as Covid vaccines were developed and rolled out within two years, allowing a return to normalcy.How Big Data and AI are Transforming BiotechnologyBiotechnology, in comparison to many technological fields, is progressing rapidly. Thanks, in part, to AI. In many ways, the field’s progress has been massively boosted by Machine Learning (ML). For example, ML is increasingly being used for protein folding, an important step involved in drug discovery.Recently, DeepMind, a UK-based AI subsidiary owned by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), announced its deep learning program called AlphaFold, which has solved 98.5% of human proteins’ structures. Prior to AlphaFold, the structure of only 17% of human proteins had been solved and it had been a challenge for half a century. Other Deep Learning techniques, such as image classification, are increasingly being adopted to detect cancer from medical scans among many other examples of AI in biotechnology. Deep Learning neural networks and big data have also proved to be highly effective in personalized medicine.Benchsci, a provider of AI health technologies, has tracked the growth of biotechnology startups adopting Machine Learning technologies  and has shown that as of 2021, 230 biotechnology startups are using AI in the solutions they provide across the world. Some of the prominent startups in the industry include Ampilon, BioSymetrics, 3BIGS, BioRelate and Causaly. Story continuesPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashBig PlayersSome of the top market players in the biotechnology industry include Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

In 2021, an unprecedented number of workers quit their jobs. What started as an economic trend called the ""great resignation"" has spurred lasting workplace changes.""It's redefining and recalibrating the relationship between employee and employer, and more specifically, what the employee feels is the employer's responsibility to them,"" said Steve Pemberton, chief human resources officer, Workhuman.In episode seven of Teal Talks, Pemberton, along with Karin Kimbrough, chief economist at LinkedIn, and Sarah Kauss, founder of S'well, sits down with Carl Segerstrom, chief talent officer, Merck, to discuss the ongoing changes in the workplace and how businesses can continue to support the growth and development of their employees.Why are workers quitting their jobs and where are they going?A Pew Research Center survey found that low pay, a lack of opportunities for advancement and feeling disrespected at work were the top reasons Americans quit their jobs in 2021.A desire to work from home in remote jobs is also driving some of the turnover in the labor market, Kimbrough said.""Nearly half of all applicants on our platform apply for at least one remote role. And this is up from an infinitesimally small number pre-pandemic,"" said Kimbrough. ""So, one thing everyone is looking for is that flexibility, and a lot of that comes through remote or hybrid opportunities.""Finding purpose at workResearch has shown that employees want purpose in their professional lives that merges with their personal values.In a recent survey, more than half of U.S. employees said they'd be willing to take a pay cut to work at a company that shares their values.Kauss, whose company was founded with a mission to rid the world of single-use plastics, has seen the benefits of this purpose-led mindset.""I was very surprised by the caliber of employees that were choosing to come to a smaller startup like S'well because of our purpose,"" Kauss said.Story continuesWhat is ""quiet quitting""?Quiet quitting, the popular term that gained global attention through a viral TikTok video, is when employees stop going above and beyond in their jobs and do the bare minimum. Some experts say quiet quitting is a residual effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, burnout and the ""great resignation"" because it helped make employees feel empowered to take control of their work-life balance.""I think what's indicative is whether or not employers are going to meet humans halfway in their recalibration of what work looks like, how it's done, where it's done, and with whom it's done.""-Steve PembertonAlthough many believe the choice of leaving a company may be in the hands of employees during the ""great resignation"", Kimbrough said LinkedIn data is starting to show a hiring slowdown and an increase in the mention of ""layoff"" in their feed.""To some, quiet quitting may mean getting the basic job done, but in these uncertain economic times, quiet quitting can mean lower productivity for the whole company, and it could push employers to let workers go,"" she said.The ""great resignation's"" silver liningWe have arguably seen some of the largest disruptions to the workforce and workplace in decades, but positive developments can be found. ""I think the most positive thing that has come out of this time is the increasing emphasis on social issues and how important individuals are to leading great teams and to making positive change in the world,"" said Kauss.Learn more about Merck's Environmental, Social &amp; Governance (ESG) approach by visiting merck.com/company-overview/esg.View original content hereMerck &amp; Co., Inc., Wednesday, December 21, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Merck &amp; Co., Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Merck &amp; Co., Inc.Website: http://www.merck.com/about/corporate-responsibility/home.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Merck &amp; Co., Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/732750/Merck-Video-What-the-Great-Resignation-Taught-Us-About-Workplace-Culture]"

140,a3fe98eb-e77a-36ce-af53-a81a5e749d3c,MOS,2022-12-22,Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) Is Paying Out A Larger Dividend Than Last Year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mosaic-nyse-mos-paying-larger-104514108.html,1671705914,STORY,['MOS'],"[The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 16th of March to $0.20. Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 1.3%. Check out our latest analysis for Mosaic Mosaic's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. However, Mosaic's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 53.6% over the next year. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 9.0%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $0.50, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.60. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 1.8% a year over that time. The dividend has seen some fluctuations in the past, so even though the dividend was raised this year, we should remember that it has been cut in the past.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Mosaic has impressed us by growing EPS at 63% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.Mosaic Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Mosaic that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: DCP Midstream LP DCP and MPLX LP MPLX while keeping an eye on The Williams Companies Inc. WMB.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:3 Midstream Stocks to Gain Despite Market VolatilityBroad inflationary pressures are making the broader market extremely volatile. This is because investors are concerned, following warnings from central banks, that interest rates are needed to be held at higher levels for a longer period. This has further induced choppiness in overall energy operations, which is reflected in the oil price chart.Companies belonging to the energy sector have been witnessing a choppy business environment since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity's price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020. However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Considering the backdrop, it would be wise for investors to bet on midstream stocks like DCP Midstream LP and MPLX LP while keeping an eye onThe Williams Companies Inc..Midstream Energy Players to the RescueAlthough the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks belonging to midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Thus, their business model is relatively low-risk, signifying considerably less exposure to both oil and gas price and volume risks.Story continuesWe have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three stocks belonging to the midstream energy space. One stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), one carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and one has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.3 Stocks in the SpotlightDCP Midstream LP: DCP Midstream is a leading provider of midstream services, having a fully integrated and resilient business model. With 12 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage assets, the master limited partnership has 2.8 billion cubic feet of daily natural gas pipeline capacity. DCP Midstream, with a Zacks Rank of 1, strongly focuses on strengthening its balance sheet with the foremost priority of reducing debt load.MPLX LP: MPLX has ownership and operating interests in midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets, thereby generating stable cashflows. With a strong focus on returning capital to unit holders, the #2 Ranked MPLX announced that as of third-quarter 2022-end, it had roughly $1 billion available under its unit repurchase authorizations.The Williams Companies Inc: The Williams Companies is well-poised to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy since it is engaged in transporting, storing, gathering and processing natural gas and natural gas liquids.With its pipeline networks spread across more than 30,000 miles, The Williams Companies connects premium basins in the United States to the key market. With a Zacks Rank of 3 at present, WMB's assets can meet 30% of the nation's consumption of natural gas, which is utilized for heating purposes and clean energy generation.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The stock climbed by 6.7% resulting in a US$7.3b addition to the company’s market value. As a result, the stock they originally bought for US$5.3m is now worth US$6.2m.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Boeing Boeing Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when President David Calhoun bought US$4.0m worth of shares at a price of US$160 per share. We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of US$196. Because the shares were purchased at a lower price, this particular buy doesn't tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price.Boeing insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeBoeing is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Boeing Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyIt's good to see that Boeing insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. Overall, two insiders shelled out US$4.2m for shares in the company -- and none sold. That shows some optimism about the company's future.Does Boeing Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Insiders own 0.06% of Boeing shares, worth about US$67m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Boeing Tell Us?The recent insider purchases are heartening. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Boeing insiders are well aligned, and that they may think the share price is too low. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Boeing. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Boeing.Of course Boeing may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

We're looking at the NASDAQ 100 also up about 1.5%. Some strong results that we got after the bell yesterday from FedEx and Nike. That is what's really driving today's action.Taking a look inside the Dow here. I mentioned the out-performance that we're seeing in Nike. When you take a look at the equal-weight performance here you can see Nike up just about 13% today followed by Boeing and Caterpillar. Only one Dow stock in the red this afternoon and that is Walgreens. Taking a look at this sector action again. All a green on the screen.Energy by far the leader once again today. Up just around 2%. Industrials, consumer discretionary not too far behind. Materials, the under-performer of the bunch, but up nearly 1% today. I mentioned that out-performance that we saw in Nike. And taking a look at some of those retail stocks. A number of names moving to the upside today.Nike obviously the clear winner here, but you have names like TJX, Home Depot, Walmart, Amazon here holding onto gains. And taking a look at the bank stocks here. Just broadening out just a little bit. Again green across the screen here with some of the big banks like JP Morgan, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley up pretty significantly this afternoon, Dave.DAVID BRIGGS: Nice to have a little hump day rally.

Now Illumina provides in-kind donations to support its mission.Gloucester is one of several communities on Cape Ann, Massachusetts, north of Boston. The region had a thriving fishing industry for hundreds of years; unfortunately, when fishing fell on hard times, so did the community. GMGI was created to catalyze research, education, and economic growth, with the idea that ""the ocean could be a new source of opportunities for human health, as well as stewarding the local waters,"" says Executive Director Christine Bolzan. ""It could also be a springboard for a new way of thinking about education in the life sciences.""Genomic Research and EducationGMGI researches the unique adaptations of marine animals to better understand not only ocean systems, but also human health. Its Donald G. Comb Science Director, Andrea Bodnar, PhD, is studying the genetics that confer remarkable lifespans on sea urchins, which can sometimes live to 200 years old. By understanding the mechanisms that drive this longevity, Bodnar and her colleagues hope to find new ways to combat age-related diseases in humans.The institute is also studying Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the Gulf of Maine using low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of over 200 cod samples. Its scientists developed a panel of genetic variants that they use to assign individual fish to one of two seasonal spawning groups, which helps fisheries manage their numbers more sustainably.GMGI was also the first to sequence the American lobster (Homarus americanus), an iconic and valuable species whose complex genomic data may have implications for research into cancer resistance, aging, and the effects of warming oceans due to climate change.To advance education in the local community, GMGI created the Gloucester Biotechnology Academy (Academy), which offers seven months of hands-on training and a three-month paid biotech internship. In 2022, all tuition costs were covered by private donations, and 95% of Academy graduates have found life sciences jobs in the region or have gone on to enroll in a degree program in biology or chemistry.Story continues""Gloucester High School has one of the lower college attendance rates in the state, and these are young people who, without this opportunity, might never gain access to the life science industry,"" says Bolzan.Students become certified laboratory technicians and learn how to culture cells and sequence DNA. The program has recently added a state-of-the-art biomanufacturing learning space to meet the growing demand among Massachusetts biotech companies for entry-level talent. The class of 2023, which began training in August, increased the academy's cohort from 20 to 42 students. It's been so successful that GMGI is in early conversations to create a second Biotechnology Academy in Boston in 2024.Students at the Academy receive intensive hands-on training from day one. ""In 10 months, our students get more bench time than most people would get in a four-year biology degree,"" says Education Director John Doyle, PhD. ""They get an hour of lecture each day and the rest of the time is spent in the lab.""To provide even more educational opportunities, GMGI is sponsoring outreach to high schools in Cape Ann and Boston. One program, called What the Heck is Biotech?, is a one-hour unit that gives students insights into the discipline and its associated educational and career pathways.By building this pipeline of trained biotech professionals and marine genomic research expertise, GMGI hopes to attract companies to Cape Ann. Many Academy graduates relocate to Boston but would jump at the chance to remain in Gloucester.""We're trying to make Gloucester and Cape Ann more attractive to companies looking to expand and maybe not pay so much for lab and office space,"" says Bolzan. ""We have a trained workforce, leading marine genomic researchers, and one of the most beautiful working waterfronts in the country. Gloucester is a great place to do science.""Connecting to ConsumablesGMGI researchers use a variety of Illumina sequencers in the lab, including the NextSeq 500 and the MiSeq. Illumina has supported the Academy program with a variety of reagents, library prep, and other consumables. Next-generation sequencing is a critical part of everything the institute does, from understanding and stewarding the ocean to educating young adults just out of high school.Thanks to Illumina's advances in sequencing technology, GMGI has the ability to sequence whole genomes in-house, making it one of only a few organizations dedicated solely to marine genomics research. ""GMGI is unique among marine research institutes in that we not only have access to the marine environment here on Gloucester's working waterfront, but we also have the tools and instruments we need to take the samples we collect from DNA extraction through to sequencing and data analysis on our bioinformatic server,"" says Jennifer Polinski, Senior Research Associate.At the Gloucester Biotechnology Academy, this hands-on approach is paying dividends in job readiness and continuing education. Some students have gone on to pursue undergraduate degrees and one is on track to enter a PhD program. For many, the rewards go well beyond a steady paycheck-they become part of a thriving ecosystem of scientists producing meaningful work.""They're looking for something more than just a job,"" says Doyle. ""One thing we've heard from students is that, for a lot of oncology research companies, everything starts with cell culture. They talk about how maybe their aunt passed away from cancer or one of their parents had cancer, and now they can have an impact in that area. For a student who was previously not on a pathway to college or a career, this is a big deal.""Illumina values partnerships with organizations like GMGI in its efforts to inspire future leaders of the genome era.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Southern The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SouthernIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Accounting Officer &amp; Comptroller, Ann Daiss, sold US$506k worth of shares at a price of US$67.47 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$70.73, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 29% of Ann Daiss's holding.Southern insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Southern Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Southern. Specifically, Chief Information Officer &amp; Executive VP Martin Davis ditched US$201k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Southern Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Southern insiders own about US$161m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The Southern Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Southern stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Southern makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Our analysis shows 4 warning signs for Southern (1 is potentially serious!) and we strongly recommend you look at them before investing.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

154,84371c8e-d99d-3cc8-a5bd-b17dee11c702,MAA,2022-12-22,3 Residential REITs to Consider Despite Industry Challenges,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-residential-reits-consider-despite-133601308.html,1671629761,STORY,"['EQR', 'MAA-PI', 'SUI', '^GSPC']","[The REIT And Equity Trust - Residential Industry constituents are expected to bear the brunt of soft rental housing demand amid low consumer confidence and weak household formation despite job gains and wage growth. Elevated deliveries and regulatory issues are also expected to add to the woes. Moreover, a hike in interest rates to counter inflation poses a risk to the flow of capital for this asset category. Also, interest expenses are expected to climb with rate hikes.Nevertheless, residential REITs like Equity Residential EQR, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. MAA and Sun Communities, Inc. SUI are poised to benefit as mortgage rates are high, and with the high cost of homeownership, the transition from renter to homeowner is difficult, making renting of apartment units a viable option. Also, residential REITs are banking on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation, rent growth and improve the efficiency of their operating platform.About the IndustryThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust - Residential category is engaged in owning, developing and managing a variety of residences. The types of residences include apartment buildings, student housing, manufactured homes and single-family homes. Residential REITs rent spaces in these properties to tenants and earn rental income in return. Markedly, some residential REITs also focus on specific classes or types of residences, or a particular geographical region. Moreover, unlike apartment buildings, manufactured homes and single-family homes that are open for leasing to all, the student housing units are leased only to students. Such real estates are, therefore, generally required to be set up within or in places closer to colleges and universities. Furthermore, the enrolment growth of educational institutes is a major driver of student housing assets.What's Shaping the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential Industry's Future?Weak New-Lease Apartment Demand: The inflationary environment and macroeconomic uncertainty are likely to have an adverse impact on this industry’s performance. In fact, despite growth in jobs and wages, new-lease apartment demand remains weak amid low consumer confidence and weak household formation. In addition, there is a seasonality impact during winter months. With leasing traffic remaining soft, apartment rents are likely to bear the brunt .Elevated Deliveries of New Units: Although supply-chain woes and labor challenges have impacted construction activity to some extent in recent quarters, deliveries of new units are likely to accelerate in a number of markets in the upcoming quarters as the ongoing construction activity remains high, resulting in a struggle on the part of landlords to lure renters. Per a RealPage report, the U.S. apartment market is on course to add almost 3,300 communities, comprising around 590,000 units in 2023. This marks the largest delivery volume since RealPage started tracking the U.S. apartment market 30 years ago. Although construction costs are up, landlords have been able to pass on the burden to renters, who are supported by wage growth to absorb cost increases through rent hikes.Rent Control and Higher Interest Rates: The rent-control regulations in some of the major markets might curb the growth tempo. In fact, in recent years, there has been an increase in states and municipalities implementing or considering rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations. This is limiting the residential REITs’ power to raise rents or charge non-rent fees. Moreover, the hike in interest rates to counter inflation poses a risk to the flow of capital for this asset category. This is likely to lead to volatility in asset prices. Also, interest expenses are expected to climb with rate hikes. However, mortgage rates are high, and with the high cost of homeownership, the transition from renter to homeowner is difficult, making renting of apartment units a viable option.Rebound in Demand for Student Housing Properties: There has been a significant rebound in demand for student housing properties on the reopening of campuses and in-person classes, as well as extracurricular activities, driving leasing activity and rent growth. Per a RealPage report, for fall 2023, already more than a quarter of student beds are pre-leased.Technology Adoption: Technological adoption gathered steam amid the social-distancing trend, and now residential REITs are combining technology with sales and service expertise, aiming at driving revenues, trimming costs, improving operating margins, as well as enhancing customer experience. The REITs are now focusing on virtual leasing assistance, virtual and self-guided tours, digital move-in process and process enhancements. Improvement in search and tour booking as well as smart home access has gained much attention, and residential REITs are focusing on these.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe REIT And Equity Trust - Residential industry is housed within the broader Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #167, which places it at the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the downward funds from operations (FFO) per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s growth potential. Since August 2022, the industry’s FFO per share estimate for 2022 has moved marginally down. Moreover, over the past year, the industry’s FFO per share estimate for 2023 has moved 1.0% south.However, before we present a few stocks that you might want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags on Stock Market PerformanceThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust - Residential industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Finance sector as well as the S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 33.2% during this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 19.4% and the broader Finance sector’s decline of 14.1%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-FFO (funds from operations) ratio, which is a commonly-used multiple for valuing Residential REITs, we see that the industry is currently trading at 15.16X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) of 16.99X.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Northrop Grumman's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Northrop Grumman is:40% = US$5.5b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.40.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Northrop Grumman's Earnings Growth And 40% ROETo begin with, Northrop Grumman has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 10% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This likely paved the way for the modest 17% net income growth seen by Northrop Grumman over the past five years. growthStory continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Northrop Grumman's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 5.5% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is NOC worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether NOC is currently mispriced by the market.Is Northrop Grumman Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Northrop Grumman has a low three-year median payout ratio of 21%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 79% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.Additionally, Northrop Grumman has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 30% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 26% over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Northrop Grumman's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

157,6313289f-ddfa-3fad-95a6-7811080615b3,NOC,2022-12-22,Boeing (BA) Wins $2B Deal to Support F/A-18 & EA-18G Aircraft,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-ba-wins-2b-deal-151403270.html,1671635643,STORY,"['BA', 'LMT', 'TXT', 'NOC']","[The Boeing Company BA recently secured a contract involving the F/A-18 and EA-18G aircraft. The award has been offered by Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA.Details of the DealValued at $2.02 billion, the contract is expected to be completed by December 2027. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will provide system upgrades for the F/A-18 and EA-18G aircraft, which include Foreign Military Sales (FMS) variants.The jet giant will also offer deliverables and services based on systems configuration set requirements consisting of all software and hardware required to implement new capabilities on the aforementioned aircraft.The majority of work related to this deal will be executed in St. Louis, MO. The contract will serve the U.S. Navy and FMS customers.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Story continuesPer a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during the 2022-2028 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.6% from the 2021 reported figure.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%. The company has a solid four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.62%, on average.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Textron Aviation’s military trainer and defense aircraft include the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 15.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 4.1% from the 2021 reported figure.Price MovementShares of Boeing have lost 6.7% in the past 12 months compared with the industry’s decline of 3.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankBoeing currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While broader macroeconomic headwinds have not made the situation not look very optimistic about the future, the manufacturer of sports apparel and footwear gave investors plenty of reasons to smile when it issued its fiscal second-quarter 2023 earnings report on Tuesday.The Beaverton, Oregon-based athletic apparel company had a great quarter compared to what Wall Street was expecting. Despite higher costs, Nike reported impressive revenue and somewhat lower inventory levels. As more consumers turn to digital solutions for their shopping needs, the retailer is standing out from the competition with record-breaking digital sales of $5.4 billion, which were up 16% from the previous quarter and 25% year over year.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with NKE. Click here to check it out. NKE 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NKEPeter Lynch Chart of NKEDespite the headwinds, it looks like Nike is sitting comfortably atop its industry niche as it continues investing in innovative solutions and quality products.Nike reassures investors with a great quarterly reportNike had an impressive quarter, easily topping Wall Street's expectations and raising its outlook. Its success in clearing through a high inventory pile is especially notable as the company continues to prove it is agile and able to respond to changing trends. With the implementation of successful strategies designed to reach its customers both online and through stores, Nike remains well-positioned for future growth.Net income for the three months ended Nov. 30 came to $1.33 billion, or 85 cents per share, a slight dip from the prior-year quarter's total of $1.34 billion, or 83 cents per share. However, revenue surged 17% to $13.32 billion versus $11.36 billion a year earlier. These results indicate the company is still on its path of positive growth and steady expansion.Story continuesInventories rose 43% due to an overabundance of stock that led to aggressive price reductions. The lower wholesale cost helped Nike maintain a 42.9% gross margin, as opposed to 45.9% last year.In a statement, CEO John Donahoe said he believes the company is already past its inventory peak and will not experience an inventory glut in the future.The company's selling and administrative expenses increased by 10% last year. Most of this was due to investments in advertising and marketing, as well as Nike Direct, which is leading its transition away from wholesale suppliers.The investment in Nike Direct has certainly paid off. Online sales jumped by 25%, while overall Nike Direct sales surged 16% to a record high of $5.4 billion this quarter on the back of growth in the digital membership platform.One major issue for Nike, however, was sales in its third-largest market, China, were weak in the most recent quarter. Due to lingering Covid-19 lockdowns, sales continued to decline, a trend the company has recorded over the last several quarters.Despite disruptions, Nike has persevered and survived the uncertain market conditions of 2022, with Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend announcing on an earnings call that the companys revenue is continuing to grow. This strong performance highlights the sports apparel manufacturer's resilience and ability to thrive in difficult times. While other retailers have been met with roadblocks and turbulence, Nike has achieved another remarkable quarter. With such success under its belt, it will be exciting to see what it will achieve in the next part of 2023.Defensive characteristics add to its appealNike is now on the path to becoming a true dividend aristocrat. The company has managed to increase its dividend for 15 consecutive years. This steady growth over the last several decades truly solidifies the company's status as one of the biggest and most reliable companies in terms of dividends paid out. Unsurprisingly, investors have gained confidence and stuck by it through its impressive run.Over the past decade, Nike has consistently demonstrated financial stability. By not paying out more than half of its earnings, it has maintained a healthy dividend payout ratio, providing investors with increased security and confidence. And this sustainability of dividends is further reflected in its dividend coverage ratio, showing how many times the company can pay cash dividends to shareholders with its earnings per share. This long-term financial performance offers reassurance of the companys financial well-being for investors seeking steady returns for years to come.TakeawayThe last quarter has been extremely positive for Nike thanks to its hard work and dedication, and it could not have come at a better time. With the holiday season just around the corner, the company is in a great place financially and investors' confidence in its financial security is increasing by the day.This quarter's strong results should reverse any negative sentiment that may have been felt previously and put Nike in an even more advantageous position as it look ahead to what will no doubt be a busy but successful year.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The Dow closed near session highs, +526 points or +1.60%, the S&amp;P 500 was +1.49% on the day, and the Nasdaq grew +162 points, +1.54%. The small-cap Russell 2000 beat the field for the second-straight session, +1.66%.Nike’s NKE strong quarterly earnings yesterday afternoon carried over to this morning’s positive market attitude, along with a slimmer Current Account Deficit for Q3. Once the opening bell rang, we got stronger-than-expected Consumer Confidence numbers for the present month: 108.3 versus 101.2 expected and 101.4 reported a month ago. Existing Home Sales, as predicted, came in lighter for November, albeit a much bigger jump: 4.09 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units versus 4.43 million reported for October.Really, though, it’s that the inflation/recession discussion is coming into clearer view these days. We already know the market hates uncertainty worst of all; while we’re still not iron clad on what will happen next year and when, we now can see the outline of the end of rate hikes in the first half of next year. If economic indicators turn sharply south in the near-term, it increases the chances of our economy sliding into a recession — but then we can expect the turnaround sooner than later, as well.So whether we recognize this bullishness as a verifiable “Santa Claus Rally” or not, one thing that does look familiar here is market participants are tacking toward following something of a best-case scenario looking forward: a 5+% Fed funds rate is a short-lived thing due to a light, short recession occurring in the first quarter of ’23. There are too many moving pieces to assert any of this with real confidence; the jury’s out on how far or how long our slide will be.As we’ve seen half a dozen times this year already, investors’ willingness to look out beyond toward greener pastures wind up getting snagged on the thorns and brush they weren’t paying attention to. Thus, the bullishness in the market winds up panning out as nothing more than another head-fake, with lower highs and lower lows over time. Even a “Santa Claus Rally” through next week might fit that mode we’ve existed within throughout 2022.Micron MU missed estimates on its bottom line for the first time since fiscal Q2 2019 this afternoon, reporting -$0.04 cents per share — doubling the expected loss of -$0.02. Revenues came in a tad better than the Zacks consensus at $4.09 billion, though still down -45% from a year ago. Next quarter earnings guidance dropped to -$0.62 per share from the anticipated -$0.30. Yet shares were up briefly on the release before slipping down -1.5% at this hour.One reason for this is the proactive stance Micron has taken in its guide: a 10% headcount cut and $30 million in charges among them. While not great news, investors seemed to appreciate the forward nature of the company taking the inevitable headwinds straight on — the sooner to come out the other end intact. Micron still holds a strong position in data storage, and that does not look to change anytime soon.Questions or comments about this article and/or its author?

It's been helped by upbeat corporate commentary and an improvement in consumer confidence,"" said Angelo Kourkafas, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis referring to Nike and FedEx.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 526.74 points, or 1.6%, to 33,376.48, the S&amp;P 500 gained 56.82 points, or 1.49%, to 3,878.44 and the Nasdaq Composite added 162.26 points, or 1.54%, to 10,709.37.Energy firms were the biggest gainers among the S&amp;P's 11 major industry sector, adding 1.89%, as oil futures rose.The smallest gainer among the sectors was consumer staples , which finished up 0.8%.Still, Wednesday's data also showed that U.S. existing home sales slumped 7.7% to a 2-1/2-year low in November as the housing market was hurt by higher mortgage rates. But the data may be fuelling investor hope that the Fed could ease up on its tightening policy.Story continues""At the macro level you have economic weakness but at the micro level you have companies that are resilient and delivering positive expectations from an earnings perspective,"" said Brian Price, head of investment management for Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Mass. ""That combination is going to be positive.""Fears of a recession following the U.S. central bank's prolonged interest rate hikes have weighed heavily on equities and these fears have put the S&amp;P on track for its biggest annual decline since 2008 and a decline for December.""There's still a lot of uncertainty and we're likely to see a lot of volatility early in the year as we could be in a mild recessionary environment,"" said Edward Jones' Kourkafas but he believes the market has already priced in a weaker economy.""We still have some headwinds ahead but maybe we don't have to price in a recession twice. So far what we've seen this year has already priced in a mild recession.""AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc finished up 4.3% after the cinema-chain operator said it suspended talks to acquire certain assets of bankrupt Cineworld Group.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.43-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.10-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&amp;P 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 69 new highs and 268 new lows.On U.S. exchanges 9.81 billion shares changed hands, compared with the 11.16 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

When you take a look here at Nike, it's the best day that the stock has had since June 2021 with shares up about 13%. This comes on the heels of the retailer's second quarter earnings report last night. The company reported beats on both the top and bottom line with revenue rising about 17% year over year in adjusted EPS, besting last year's numbers for the first time in four quarters.Perhaps most importantly though, Dave, the inventory glut may be over at Nike. President and CEO John Donahoe saying, we believe the inventory peak is behind us. Now, inventory is still sitting at $9.3 billion.- It didn't move.- But they expect that number to come down in the next couple quarters. And they also think margins are gonna be fixed here in the next couple quarters. So then you start to wonder what's the next catalyst for Nike? What are some other things to watch?And I did wanna bring this to your attention, an interesting sort of partnership today with Netflix. So Netflix is gonna be streaming ""Nike Training Club."" And Shanna, you'll like this too. You guys are both kinda home workout people.- Mm-hmm.- ""Nike Training Club,"" a complete collection of over 90 workouts, over 30 hours of sessions released on Netflix. Perhaps maybe more of an impact on Netflix's stock than Nike's stock. But I think interesting to see Nike kinda getting into that streaming play and pairing up with Netflix here.- That was gonna be my reaction, a much bigger impact on Netflix because one of the problems within their that they talk about is people not spending enough time on the platform, not getting back on the platform each day, only visiting on occasion to watch their favorite shows. They need something sticky. They need something repetitive.And yeah, for those of us that work out every day, that have been doing P90X for 15 years, heck yes. I think this is a tremendous move. Don't know how big it is for Nike down the road. But again, another aspect to satisfy some loyal customers.Story continues- Yeah, certainly. I mean, I think it makes sense more so-- I totally agree with you guys-- for Netflix rather than Nike just in terms of what this could mean for the brand, for the companies going forward. My question though is how many people are actually going to use those classes? Like, are you going to try because I know you're a Netflix subscriber.- Absolutely.- You are.- Absolutely, yeah.- I'm one of the more questionable.- I work out almost every day. And I just-- I'm not interested--- At home?- No.- Oh.- But I do at home sometimes on the weekends. And I just-- I don't connect with the TV and working out in that way. I'd rather just do my own workout, write it up, and not do the TV scenario. So I guess I'm just not the right consumer.- I will do a review. I will report back to you, sir.- Maybe I'll try it out [INAUDIBLE].- OK, deal. All right.]"

The bank had systematic failures in its servicing of automobile loans that resulted in $1.3 billion in harm across more than 11 million accounts. It incorrectly applied borrowers’ payments, improperly charged fees and interest, and wrongfully repossessed borrowers’ vehicles.Also, during at least a seven-year period, WFC improperly denied thousands of mortgage loan modifications, which led to its customers losing their homes to wrongful foreclosures.In addition to these, Wells Fargo has been unfairly charging surprise overdraft fees on debit card transactions and ATM withdrawals for years. The bank unlawfully froze consumer accounts and mispresented fee waivers, because of which, affected customers were unable to access any of their money in accounts at the bank for an average of at least two weeks.Per the CFPB’s order, Wells Fargo will pay redress to more than 16 million affected consumer accounts. The $1.7-billion fine will go to the CFPB’s civil penalty fund, where it will be used to provide relief to victims of consumer financial law violations.The CFPB’s director, Rohit Chopra, said, “The CFPB is ordering Wells Fargo to refund billions of dollars to consumers across the country. This is an important initial step for accountability and long-term reform of this repeat offender.”Chopra also mentioned, “While today's order addresses a number of consumer abuses, it should not be read as a sign that Wells Fargo has moved past its longstanding problems or that the CFPB's work here is done. Wells Fargo has consistently been one of the most problematic repeat offenders of the banks and credit unions we supervise. Finding a permanent resolution to this bank’s pattern of unlawful behavior is a top priority.”Nevertheless, as a relief, Wells Fargo has taken several steps to address regulatory concerns, including strengthening its risk and control infrastructure since the appointment of Charlie Scharf as the CEO of the company in October 2019.Scharf said, “As we have said before, we and our regulators have identified a series of unacceptable practices that we have been working systematically to change and provide customer remediation where warranted. This far-reaching agreement is an important milestone in our work to transform the operating practices at Wells Fargo and to put these issues behind us. Our top priority is to continue to build a risk and control infrastructure that reflects the size and complexity of Wells Fargo and run the company in a more controlled, disciplined way.”Thus, while WFC still has a long list of pending legal cases and remains under close supervision of the regulatory authorities, the steps taken by the company to transform the way it operates should provide some respite.Moreover, Wells Fargo’s prudent expense management initiatives continue to support its financial. The company is focused on reducing its expense base by streamlining organizational structure, closing branches, and reducing headcount by optimizing operations and other back-office teams. Such efforts are likely to support bottom-line growth.Over the past six months, shares of WFC have gained 6.2% compared with the industry’s growth of 2%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, WFC carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Ambac claimed that between 2004 and 2006, it insured certain mortgage-backed securities backed by poorly underwritten Countrywide Financial loans. Countrywide is a lender whom BofA acquired in 2008.Countrywide’s purchase put BofA at the center of years of litigation over who was to blame for a mortgage-market meltdown.In a separate case, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s GS asset-management arm agreed to pay $4 million to settle the Securities and Exchange Commission’s claims that Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. failed to follow policies and procedures for certain environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment products.The SEC uncovered procedural failures involving the ESG research used to select and monitor securities from April 2017 to February 2020.

Several serious headwinds, including record-high inflation, global supply-chain disruptions and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, wreaked havoc with the investors’ confidence, leading to bearish sentiments.The Federal Reserve stepped up its monetary policy with an ultra-aggressive stance to counter the “sticky” inflation. This resulted in the short-term interest rates reaching a 15-year high of 4.50% this year, with the central bank indicating more rate hikes in 2023. As we know, banks thrive in rising rate regimes, but this hawkish stance has increased the chances of economic slowdown and/or recession next year. Even the Fed’s December Summary of Economic Projections suggests that the U.S. economy will be slowing down considerably next year, with just 0.5% growth.Thus, the new year is going to be a tough one for banks. While higher interest rates will keep supporting banks’ top line, an economic slowdown will result in a gradual drop in loan demand. Hence, investors are pessimistic about the performance of the banking industry and wary of investing in the industry players. However, investors can follow stocks – Wells Fargo &amp; Company WFC, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. CFG and Hancock Whitney Corporation HWC – that analysts show interest in because they have a better understanding of the company fundamentals.Analysts have a detailed insight into the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment. Hence, analyst recommendations can help pick suitable stocks for generating robust returns.3 Analyst Suggested Bank Stocks for 2023We shortlisted the above-mentioned three bank stocks with the help of the Zacks Stock Screener. These stocks have a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). Further, more than 70% of brokers recommend these stocks as a strong buy or buy. Our research shows such stocks provide good investment opportunities.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The chosen stocks have lost value due to ongoing concerns but have robust earnings prospects and are expected to perform well in 2023. This optimistic stance signifies bullish analyst sentiments, reflecting solid fundamentals and the expectation of outperformance going forward. Year-to-Date Price PerformanceStory continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWells Fargo, based in San Francisco, is one of the largest financial services companies in the United States. The company offers services across North America and globally through more than 4,500 retail bank branches and a broad ATM network.While legal and regulatory troubles continue to mar WFC’s near-term prospects (the most recent being a $3.7 billion settlement with the CFPB over several matters related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts and mortgage lending), such resolutions seem to be a step forward for removing the asset cap imposed by the Fed.Wells Fargo continues to build on its deposit base. While the pace of deposit growth is likely to continue moderating in the near term on the economic slowdown, the considerable strength in its consumer business and commercial banking segments will likely aid the deposit balance in the upcoming period. Further, WFC is focused on lowering its expense base by streamlining organizational structure, consolidating branches and reducing headcount by optimizing operations and other back-office teams. Realized and identified potential gross savings through these efforts are expected to be in excess of $10 billion.Wells Fargo, with a market cap of $159.4 billion, has lost 14.6% in the year-to-date period. While the company’s earnings are expected to decline 24% for 2022, the same is projected to rebound and surge 34.7% for 2023.Citizens Financial, headquartered in Providence, RI, is one of the largest retail bank holding companies in the United States. CFG operates roughly 1200 branches and around 3,300 ATMs in 14 states and the District of Columbia.Robust loans and deposit balances, and higher interest rates will keep aiding net interest income and margin. Citizens Financial’s focus on executing a series of revenue and efficiency initiatives led to the introduction of “Tapping Our Potential” (TOP) program in late 2014. It remains on track for more than $115 million of pre-tax run-rate benefits through the TOP 7 Program in 2022. The bank is well-poised to grow via acquisitions, reflected in its accomplishment of several major buyouts in the last several years. These efforts enable the company to expand its product capabilities and geographic reach.Shares of CFG, which has a market cap of $18.8 billion, have lost 19.5% so far this year. For 2022, the company’s earnings are projected to witness a year-over-year fall of 22.7%. For 2023, earnings are expected to jump 23.4%.Hancock Whitney is a bank and financial holding company, which operates through 177 full-service bank branches and 239 ATMs across Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Florida and Texas. Supported by the continued rise in loan demand, higher interest rates and business expansion initiatives, this Gulfport, MS-based company’s bottom line is likely to keep improving.The company’s strategic investments in growth and new markets are expected to bolster its top line. Further, the company noted that higher rates helped it reach the targeted efficiency ratio of 55% well ahead of time. Management projects total core loan growth to be 8-9% this year. Apart from organic expansion efforts, HWC has undertaken acquisitions in the past, which continue to support its financials. Given the strong balance sheet position, the company is well-poised to further grow through inorganic means to diversify revenues and improve market share.For 2022, HWC’s earnings are projected to witness year-over-year growth of 7.5%. For 2023, earnings are expected to rise 3.4%. The company has a market cap of $4 billion.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the sector and go directly to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Biotechnology.The Covid-19 pandemic has awoken the world to its vulnerability to airborne viruses whose outbreaks are extremely hard to contain. It certainly wasn’t the last pandemic, as a Nature study shows how loss of biodiversity is likely to increase the frequency of viral outbreaks. However, the pandemic was also an occasion that showcased the global biotechnological capability, as Covid vaccines were developed and rolled out within two years, allowing a return to normalcy.How Big Data and AI are Transforming BiotechnologyBiotechnology, in comparison to many technological fields, is progressing rapidly. Thanks, in part, to AI. In many ways, the field’s progress has been massively boosted by Machine Learning (ML). For example, ML is increasingly being used for protein folding, an important step involved in drug discovery.Recently, DeepMind, a UK-based AI subsidiary owned by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), announced its deep learning program called AlphaFold, which has solved 98.5% of human proteins’ structures. Prior to AlphaFold, the structure of only 17% of human proteins had been solved and it had been a challenge for half a century. Other Deep Learning techniques, such as image classification, are increasingly being adopted to detect cancer from medical scans among many other examples of AI in biotechnology. Deep Learning neural networks and big data have also proved to be highly effective in personalized medicine.Benchsci, a provider of AI health technologies, has tracked the growth of biotechnology startups adopting Machine Learning technologies  and has shown that as of 2021, 230 biotechnology startups are using AI in the solutions they provide across the world. Some of the prominent startups in the industry include Ampilon, BioSymetrics, 3BIGS, BioRelate and Causaly. Story continuesPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashBig PlayersSome of the top market players in the biotechnology industry include Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), argenx SE (NASDAQ:ARGX) and Galapagos NV (NASDAQ:GLPG).Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) are known for significant contributions in helping solve recent disease outbreaks, with vaccines.Other Biotechnology Trends to Watch in 2023Another often overlooked but highly lucrative emerging field in biotechnology is the artificial meat industry. The meat and dairy industry’s carbon footprint is leading to a demand for artificial meat/dairy products. Its technology has been pioneered through stem cell research. Some leading US startups in this domain include Memphis Meats, New Age Meats and Finless Foods.Industry Outlook: 2030According to Grand View Research, the biotechnology industry is valued at $1 trillion as of 2021. The value is projected to reach nearly $4 trillion in 2030, with a CAGR of 14%. The cultured-meat sub-industry, on the other hand, is in its early phase and is valued at $600 million, going by their funding in 2020 and 2021. McKinsey estimates that the market value of lab-grown meat will reach $25 billion in 2030, as consumer acceptance gradually takes hold. Lab grown meat could account for 0.5% of the global meat supply by that time. Some of the top countries in terms of research in biotechnology include Singapore, Sweden, United States, United Kingdom and Germany. Below, we list the 12 most advanced countries in biotechnology.Our MethodologyFor our list of the 12 most advanced countries in biotechnology, we’ve ranked them based on a Nature study that evaluated the advancement of biotechnology in different countries based on important factors. The first factor was ‘public biotechnology’ that evaluated publicly listed biotech companies. Another pillar is focused on education and considers countries’ efforts in biotech fields in academia, like the number of degrees and students.

177,def13471-6dc8-323c-99bd-b12d87e3faaf,PFE,2022-12-22,Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $0.41,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-nyse-pfe-increasing-dividend-154407095.html,1671637447,STORY,['PFE'],"[The board of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend by 2.5% on the 3rd of March to $0.41, up from last year's comparable payment of $0.40. This takes the dividend yield to 3.1%, which shareholders will be pleased with. Check out our latest analysis for Pfizer Pfizer's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. However, prior to this announcement, Pfizer's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 36.5% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 50%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendPfizer Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.88 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.60. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.2% over that duration. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Pfizer has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 27% per annum. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.Pfizer Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Pfizer is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for Pfizer that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Is Pfizer not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

These payment options are more popular in Europe and US, but are gaining prominence in Asia, Australia and New Zealand as well. With the rise of digital payments, there has also been a marked increase in the use of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) applications. Buy Now, Pay Later is basically short-term financing that allows consumers to make purchases and pay for them later through interest free installments. Many BNPL companies have emerged over the years, offering digital payment services to customers and merchants around the world. The BNPL companies charge retailers a fee, which is between 3% and 6% of BNPL sales, and this cost is likely to be passed onto consumers.  BNPL apps are the latest financial tools which make it easier for customers to access credit for the products they have bought. These apps integrate with retail stores, allowing the customers to carry on shopping activities conveniently and settle the bill offsite with deferred methods. Some of the top firms in this space include Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), among others discussed in detail below. The global BNPL market size is expected to expand up to $20.40 billion by 2028. It is important to note that since the global pandemic struck, the buying patterns of customers have changed drastically. It is also noteworthy that almost 75% of BNPL users are Generation Z or millennials, and they are more cautious about credit in times of financial crisis. The global BNPL market was valued at $15.91 billion in 2021. The market is projected to grow from $22.86 billion in 2022 to $90.51 billion by 2029, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate of 21.7% during the forecast period of 2022 to 2029. The global BNPL market exhibited a higher growth of 48.3% in 2020 due to the global pandemic. The US tops the BNPL market. According to recent research, BNPL users in the country have increased by 300% since 2018, with 45 million users in 2021.Story continuesThe leading players in BNPL are offering various services for categories such as travel and tourism, online shopping, consumer electronics, retail, healthcare insurances, banking and financial services. Further, several e-commerce companies across retail, banking and healthcare insurance are adopting this service to facilitate customers around the globe. With these dynamic changes worldwide, the online shopping and digital payments segment has gained immense significance, leading towards increased demand for BNPL services all around the world. Today, millions of shoppers use BNPL services, evidenced by the 215% year-over-year growth for the industry in the first two months of 2021. Further, it has been forecasted that around 1.5 billion consumers around the world will spend $995 billion through BNPL by year 2026. Our MethodologyThese were picked from a careful assessment of the BNPL industry.

We discussed Affirm in our Q4 letter, saying the following:Affirm is a “Buy Now, Pay Later” (BNPL) company founded by former PayPal CTO and cofounder Max Levchin. They provide installment loans to consumers, partnering with retail companies looking to drive higher sales. They have two primary products: a zero-fee installment loan for consumers with the best credit scores, and a more traditional product with 20%+ interest rates for subprime borrowers. Their stated plan is to disrupt the credit industry with more transparent, lower-fee loans. At a roughly $28b market cap at the start of 2022, AFRM stock was priced at more than 20x trailing sales, a steep price for a money-losing lender. While their early lead in online BNPL transactions and partnerships with fast-growing retailers like Peloton has fueled significant historical growth, a wave of competition has arrived… While the stock has already fallen sharply from where we initiated our short position, we think it could fall another ~40% to trade at 8x FY2022 sales.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest BNPL Companies In The World. Suggested Articles:11 Best Low Risk Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

The stock is down -5% this year vs. the decline of -8.2% for the Zacks Diversified Chemicals industry and -7.3% decline for the Zacks Basic Materials sector. Driving the stock's momentum is the wide range of applications for its industrial gases, Linde is making the world more productive by the day. The company’s primary products in industrial gases include oxygen, which is used as life support in hospitals. Its process gas, like hydrogen, is being utilized for clean fuels, while its high-purity and specialty gases are employed to manufacture electronics.Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers backed by minimum purchase requirements, thereby securing stable cashflows. The firm reported strong third-quarter results, owing to increased prices and volumes across all end markets, except for healthcare.(You can read the full research report on Linde here &gt;&gt;&gt;)BP shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+28.9% vs. +15.9%). The company has a strong portfolio of upstream projects, backing impressive production growth. BP boasted that the target of adding a net production of 900 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 from key projects was met successfully.It set an aggressive energy transition plan to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy. Although there is no production from its Russia incorporated joint ventures, BP is projecting higher upstream volumes this year. Before reporting its December-quarter results, the energy major is willing to complete an additional $2.5 billion in share buy-backs.However, the leading integrated energy company’s balance sheet is considerably more levered than most peers, limiting its financial flexibility.

The company trimmed its guidance for revenue growth in anticipation of an economic downturn, which might slow down consumer spending. This is a major negative. Further, intensifying market competition and foreign exchange headwinds remain risks.However, PayPal’s third quarter results were driven by strong growth in total payments volume owing to increasing net new active accounts. Strengthening customer engagement was a positive. Strong performance by Venmo contributed well to the TPV growth. The Zacks analyst believe growing transaction revenues are likely to continue driving the top-line growth.Also, solid momentum across peer to peer and PayPal Checkout experiences is a tailwind. Further, PayPal’s growing traction in the United States remains a major positive. Considering the abovementioned facts, the Zacks analyst expect net revenues in 2022 to rise 8.4% from 2021.(You can read the full research report on PayPal here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include BHP Group Limited (BHP), Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) have proposed an amendment to the $1.7 billion funding package, to raise the $600 reporting requirement for third-party payment networks such as Venmo and PayPal, to $10,000.See: Don’t File Your Taxes Early Says IRS, Wait for Form 1099-KUsed Car Market: Who Are the Biggest Winners and Losers as Prices Drop?“This is the best relief we can get for people,” Manchin told CNBC about the $10,000 threshold, adding that it was “the best way to approach it.”The lower threshold was enacted as part of the American Rescue Plan (ARP), in March 2021. Now, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires reporting of payment transactions via payment apps such as Venmo, PayPal, Stripe and Square, for goods and services sold that meet or exceed $600 in a calendar year.The threshold for reporting was significantly lowered, as the former requirement was to report payments above $20,000 and exceeding 200 transactions within the calendar year, according to the IRS.It’s important to note that this change applies only to payments received for sales of goods and services and not to friends and family payments, for example.Venmo says on its website that what makes a payment “goods and services” is when senders tag a purchase as “goods and services,” whether it’s for a product you sell, a service you provide or even an old couch you don’t want anymore.However, several experts and organizations have argued against the new rule, in part because it might create confusion.The American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) for example, wrote a letter to the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee on Dec. 16, expressing its “deep concerns” regarding the reporting threshold.AICPA said it supported the suggestion from The National Taxpayers Union Foundation (NTUF) to revert the change.Both organizations also said that even increasing the requirement to $5,000 would make a difference.“Setting the level at, say, $5,000 would not eliminate the entirety of the paperwork challenges associated with a new 1099-K standard, but it would make significant progress toward that goal while shielding taxpayers, platforms, and the IRS from some of the worst administrative fallout,” the NTUF said in a statement.Story continuesAs for Hagerty, he led a group of Republican senators in February 2022 to introduce the Stop the Nosy Obsession with Online Payments Act (SNOOP) to strike the tax code provision.Take Our Poll: How Long Do You Think It Will Take You To Pay Off Your Credit Card Debt?“As a result of the new provision, thousands of small businesses will have to fill out 1099-Ks to provide their personal information to the IRS, despite the IRS’ poor history of safeguarding Americans’ personal data,” according to a statement at the time.More From GOBankingRates25 Sneaky Car Dealership Tricks To Avoid at All CostsSocial Security Payment Schedule 2023: What Dates To Watch Out ForThe 10 Best Balance Transfer Credit Cards for 20237 Ways To Know You're Ready To Start InvestingThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Proposal Made to Raise Venmo, PayPal Tax Reporting Requirement to $10,000 – How Could It Impact You?]"
184,80e31f7d-cbd2-3b5d-80ca-cc45232461ff,IBM,2022-12-22,5 Things You Might Not Know About Apple CEO Tim Cook,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-things-might-not-know-141212143.html,1671650755,STORY,['AAPL'],"[In August 2011, Tim Cook was named the CEO of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) following the death of company CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs.Through the years, Cook has guided Apple to become one of the biggest companies in the world, with market capitalization now over $2.3 trillion.Here are five things you might now know about Tim Cook.1. Education: Cook graduated in 1982 with a bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering from Auburn University. After Auburn, Cook went on to attend Duke University. While at Duke, Cook earned an MBA from the Fuqua School of Business in 1988. Cook was in the top 10% of his business school class, earning the title of Fuqua Scholar.Cook returned to Auburn in 2010 to be the graduation commencement speaker.2. Worked for Apple Competitor: One of Cook’s first jobs out of college was working for IBM (NYSE: IBM). While at IBM, Cook became the fulfillment director for the company’s North American division, where he managed manufacturing and distribution. Cook worked at IBM for 12 years.Related Link: If You Invested $1,000 In Apple Stock When Tim Cook Became CEO, Here's How Much You'd Have Today3, Career at Apple: After working at IBM and a six-month position at Compaq Computer as a vice president of corporate materials, Cook joined Apple.“My most significant discovery so far in my life was the result of one single decision: my decision to join Apple,” Cook said in 2010.Cook took a leap of faith in joining Apple as it came in 1998, when the company was in near bankruptcy.Positions held by Cook included vice president, executive vice president and chief operating officer. Cook also led the Macintosh division.4. Coming Out In 2014: Cook confirmed he was gay in a Bloomberg opinion piece written in October 2013.“While I have never denied my sexuality, I haven’t publicly acknowledged it either, until now. So let me be clear: I’m proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me,” Cook wrote.Story continuesCook declared that coming out publicly was an important step in helping push for human rights and quality for all. He was encouraged by the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who said, “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’”Cook said that he didn’t consider himself an activist for gay rights but hoped that it could inspire others.“If hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is, or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone, or inspire people to insist on their equality, then it’s worth the trade-off with my own privacy,” Cook said.5. Misdiagnosed With MS: In 1996, Cook was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, which ended up being a misdiagnosis.“The doctor said, ‘Mr. Cook, you’ve either had a stroke, or you have MS,’” Cook recalled when telling of his MS diagnosis. The symptoms came from “lugging a lot of incredibly heavy luggage around,” according to Cook.Cook is now a frequent supporter of multiple sclerosis events and makes donations to organizations associated with the disease.Cook has credited this experience as a wake-up call to take care of himself and his health. He enjoys cycling and hiking and also has a regular gym routine.Photo: Courtesy AppleSee more from BenzingaThis Celebrity Has Owned Berkshire Hathaway Shares For 25 Years And Claims He Is Related To Warren BuffettIf You Invested $1,000 In Bitcoin When Donald Trump Said He Wasn't A Fan, Here's How Much You'd Have TodayDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

If you want to read about some more tech stocks for long term investment, go directly to 5 Best Tech Stocks For Long Term Investment.In no era of human history have business and technology been so inextricably linked as they are in the present times. The significance of this can be gauged from a recent report that outlines the six trending industries in 2022. All of these overlap with the technology space. The industries include space tech, bio tech, neuro tech, robot tech, climate tech, and energy tech. These trends were witnessed despite a broad macro slowdown at the market which favored value stocks as investors reevaluate their risk profiles in light of recession fears. According to analysts, the tech industry remains a robust choice for business growth and career advancement in 2022. As per a recent report, the information technology market grew from $8,384.32 billion in 2021 to $9,358.51 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate of 11.6%. This growth came despite the pandemic, the Russia Ukraine war, and economic uncertainties. Looking forward into 2023, these growth trends are likely to accelerate as the economy recovers from a tumultuous 2022. Investors should monitor long-term trends in the tech space, like the optimizing of IT systems for greater reliability, maintaining the value integrity of production AI systems and scaling vertical offerings, as well as the accelerating strategies to tap new virtual markets. Digital immune systems, applied observability, AI trust, risk and security management, industry clouds platform, platform engineering, wireless value realization, super apps, adaptive AI, metaverse, and sustainable technology are all also sectors investors should keep a close eye on. Some of the top stocks in the tech sector for the long term include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). Analysts have urged leading technology providers to play a top role in helping enterprises use innovative technologies to slide through the current storms of disruption. The use of tech as a safe haven in times of recession, especially in the services sector, is also likely to rise in the coming years. Story continuesSource:PixabayOur MethodologyThe companies that have long-term growth catalysts and operate in the tech sector were selected for the list. Special importance was assigned to outlining the basic business fundamentals and analyst ratings for each firm to provide readers with some context so they can make more informed investment choices. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Best Tech Stocks For Long Term Investment12. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40 International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) provides integrated solutions and services worldwide. On December 13, the firm announced that it had signed a deal with Rapidus to work on developing the breakthrough 2 nanometer node technology of the former for implementation in Japan by the latter. The US government plans to invest hundreds of billions in chip firms over the next few years to shore up chip manufacturing in the country. As the demand for electronics and electric vehicles rises, so will the demand for chips. IBM can jump on this growth curve by investments in the chip space. On October 18, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan maintained a Buy rating on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stock and lowered the price target to $145 from $155, noting that it has been estimated that about 80% of the software portfolio is non-transactional contracts linked to mission-critical projects.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Boston-based investment firm Arrowstreet Capital is a leading shareholder in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) with 4.3 million shares worth more than $515.8 million. Just like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the best tech stocks for long term investment. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, St. James Investment Company, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was not the first company to build computers. The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department in the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.One cannot overstate how powerful IBM was in the computer industry in the 1950s and 1960s. Every competitor rightly worried that if their product worked too well for too long, it was only a matter of time before an army of IBM salesforce representatives mobilized. In their easily recognizable uniforms of starched white shirts, red ties and blue suits, IBM marketers marched on their customers and offered a more expensive, but much more defensible, choice. “Nobody gets fired for buying IBM” was a common phrase. Even competitors acknowledged that the company excelled at sales. As a UNIVAC executive once complained, ‘It doesn’t do much good to build a better mousetrap if the other guy selling mousetraps has five times as many salesmen.’” (read more)11. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69    Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, manufactures and sells computer products and technologies worldwide. On November 18, Intel revealed that it has introduced its real-time DeepFake detector, FakeCatcher. This Deep Fake detector analyzes the blood flow in the video pixels to return results in milliseconds with an accuracy of 96%. The product is just one example of the growth path that the firm has in different sectors, like video editing and news dissemination, as the demand for powerful chips rises. The company, one of the leading US-based plays in the semi space, is also a reliable dividend player for the long term. On October 31, Citi analyst Christopher Danely maintained a Neutral rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock and lowered the price target to $27 from $30, noting that the company reported mixed results and guided well below consensus driven by the PC downturn.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 69 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.9 billion in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 65 in the preceding quarter worth $2.5 billion.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”10. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74   Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. On December 5, Micron Technology revealed that its mobile memory chip, low-power double data rate 5X (LPDDR5X), is gaining market traction with the validation of its mobile memory for Qualcomm Technologies’ latest mobile platform for flagship smartphones. The smartphone market is one of the biggest businesses in the world. Billions of people own smartphones and are increasingly reliant on these machines for many basic tasks. Micron, whose chips power these phones, has a steady avenue of growth in the smartphone space for the long-term. On October 7, Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers maintained an Overweight rating on Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stock and lowered the price target to $70 from $75, noting that it won’t be surprising to see shares trading lower ahead of the upcoming first-quarter earnings release.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 74 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.5 billion in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”9. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88   Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, and energy generation and storage systems. On September 30, Tesla launched the prototype of its humanoid robot named Dubbed Optimus. This launch has set a mark on reshaping the future of physical work using artificial intelligence. The company said that the robot is running on its Self-Driving computer. Over the years, the firm has distinguished itself in the electric vehicle space through the use of cutting-edge software that competitors are often lacking. The foray into robotics underscores the innovation-driven values of the firm which have helped it build such a strong profile in the EV space. On December 13, Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney maintained a Buy rating on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock and lowered the price target to $235 from $305, noting that it is believed that if Tesla can demonstrate that its demand levers and the Inflation Reduction Act contribution can help drive strong growth and margins in the coming quarters, then an upside case could be visible for the stock to trade to about $300.     At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 88 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $7.4 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 73 in the preceding quarter worth $7.2 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In 2014, before we began to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Musk’s electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Tesla’s prospects. That was principally for two reasons:First, automobile manufacturing and distribution is unusually complicated, capital intensive, and highly regulated, which makes profitability problematic;second, cars with ICE motors require extensive annual maintenance, and dealer services revenues, not profits from automobile sales, are the most important contributor to profits of perpetual licensed ICE car dealerships.Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE, not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motors’ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful. (click here to read more…)8. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89     NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 16, NVIDIA made a multi-year partnership with Microsoft to build a supercomputer powered by Microsoft Azure’s advanced supercomputing infrastructure. This would be one of the most powerful cloud-based artificial intelligence supercomputers in the world. NVIDIA chips are considered some of the most advanced across the world and are especially popular among gaming enthusiasts. This niche has helped the company establish a stable foundation which it is now using to expand into new spaces in the tech sector. On December 12, Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay maintained an Outperform rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and raised the price target to $220 from $200, noting that the company is believed to be the leader in accelerated computing, and maintains wide and deep technological moats.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with 19.3 million shares worth more than $2.3 billion.  In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“At the company-specific level, there was a broad correction across the entire portfolio. While four of our holdings contributed to performance, the contribution to absolute returns was less than 100bps combined, as unfortunately none of them was large enough to move the needle. We had 16 investments detracting over 100bps each with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), our second largest detractor, costing the Fund 254bps.NVIDIA’s stock was hit even harder, down 44.4%, impacted by concerns over the health of the consumer, dramatic declines in crypto, and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Despite the sell-off and the increased near-term volatility in its gaming business, NVIDIA’s revenues grew 46% year-over-year with 48% operating margins, driven by continued strength in its data center business as companies across industries adopt AI and ML…(read more)7. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 103    ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) provides enterprise cloud computing solutions that define, structure, consolidate, manage, and automate services for enterprises worldwide. On October 5, ServiceNow unveiled that it would acquire Era Software, an observability and log management innovator. The company said that customers will be able to gather actionable insights that deliver value across the business, within a single solution purpose-built for the era of digital business. The purchase highlights the growth momentum in the software industry that has showed it can handle macro pressures this year. As more businesses go digital, the firm can expect to grow significantly in the coming years. On October 27, Truist analyst Joel Fishbein maintained a Buy rating on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stock and lowered the price target to $525 from $550, noting that the company reported a strong quarter of constant-currency growth, but currency headwinds continue to be a drag on the top line performance and are starting to impact the bottom line as well.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management LLC is a leading shareholder in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) with 1.7 million shares worth more than $639.7 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Ensemble Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an enterprise software company that helps its corporate customers integrate all of their various software products into a unified platform. Their products are a key element in driving the digital transformation nearly every large company is undergoing. At the recent JP Morgan investor day, CEO Jamie Dimon explained that while the company could reduce expenses if needed should the economy slow, their spending on digital transformation would continue as this spending was critical to the company managing costs and maximizing revenue over time. As an example of this type of spending, Dimon specifically pointed to ServiceNow, calling out that the company’s products now oversaw the single largest collection of JP Morgan data and highlighted that working with them had saved JP Morgan $50 million over the past few years.

(NYSE:CRM) provides customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together worldwide. On September 21, Salesforce revealed its real-time platform Genie, a hyper-scale real-time data platform that powers the entire Salesforce Customer 360 platform. With this platform, every company can turn data into customer magic, delivering seamless, highly personalized experiences across sales, service, marketing, and commerce. The revelation is the latest example of the leading cloud services provided by the firm to businesses across the world. The firm is firmly committed to a strategy focused on delivering growth while continuing to expand operating margins. On December 5, Credit Suisse analyst Phil Winslow maintained an Outperform rating on Salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) stock and lowered the price target to $225 from $250, noting that the company reported solid third-quarter results on the income statement.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 117 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $8.2 billion in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), compared to 116 in the preceding quarter worth $7.9 billion. Along with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the best tech stocks for long term investment. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has become a dominant global player in sales, customer service, commerce and marketing software over the past 20 years. The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. This discount is an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Tech Stocks For Long Term Investment. Suggested Articles:15 Biggest Endowments in the US10 Best BDC Stocks To BuyTop 13 Gas Tanker Shipping Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

Obviously a lot for everyone to unpack here. We're going to take a look at what might be in store for 2023.Now, forecasts see pressure ahead as companies face growing recession risks, but what role could the US dollar play in all of this? I mean, we know that as we saw the yields rise, we saw a lot of people going into the US dollar for safety, wondering what would happen with recession fears. And that's obviously affecting a lot of companies-- multinational companies with exposure in overseas markets, Akiko.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah although we have seen the dollar index come down since the end of November, about 8% right now, and that's kind of been the story here. When you think about what's been playing out among corporates in 2022, it really has been about the strength of the dollar.Now, we've got some companies who are especially exposed to all of this-- Nike, IBM, P&amp;G, Hasbro, Caterpillar, Qualcomm, I mean, basically any company that has a significant exposure outside of the US. The stronger dollar obviously makes those foreign revenue less valuable when they bring it back into the US. So you could argue that as we've seen the dollar weakening, that would potentially be good news for some of these corporate earnings.Now having said that, it's the reason behind the weakening of the dollar that's raised questions about where things could go going into next year. I want to point out a note from Wells Fargo saying they expect a rally in Q1 before things start to weaken, and they've talked about the dollar falling as much as 10%. A lot of that has to do with where the Fed's likely to move. Even though the rate hikes are likely to slow down, that's partly because of the recessionary concerns. That is likely to pull back on the dollar even further.Story continuesAnd right now we're looking at 104.11. Again, worth noting that at the end of November, we were looking at roughly somewhere around 114.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, when we look at some of these predictions for where we could see the S&amp;P going, we know that Morgan Stanley's chief equity strategist Mike Wilson, he sees the S&amp;P falling as much as 21% in Q1. Recovering, though, to about 3,900 by the end of 2023. We saw similar bearishness also from Bank of America as well. They're also expecting that the earnings outlook will deteriorate next year.And a lot of this, the turning point in what they're considering which might push equities back up is whether or not the Fed will halt when it comes to these Fed rate hikes. So a lot of big ifs because there's a lot of data that can come out between now and then. We know the Fed is data dependent, so we'll be keeping an eye on that.]"

Currently, IBM has a set of environmental commitments, including achieving Net Zero GHG Emissions by 2030 and diverting 90% of nonhazardous waste (by weight) from landfill and incineration by 2025. And IBM Global Real Estate (GRE) plays a critical role in meeting these targets.IBM, Wednesday, December 21, 2022, Press release pictureRoughly 40% of the global share of annual carbon dioxide emissions comes from buildings. The UN Environment Program states that if nothing is done, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from buildings will more than double in the next 20 years.To meet targets for GHG emissions, buildings and cities must shift from being part of the problem to being part of the solution. A survey from IBM and Morning Consult found that in the next two years, 62% of business leaders plan to invest in solutions that help manage assets, facilities and infrastructure to drive clean energy transition, efficient waste management and decarbonization.Clients are looking for mature, real-world solutions that can shorten their path to sustainability, while helping improve the efficiency and performance of their operations. In this context, IBM GRE is leading a far-reaching transformation of nearly every facet of IBM's real estate and asset management practices that demonstrates how to turn sustainability ambition into action.Using IBM's technology and expertise to capture dataLike other corporations, IBM is on a journey to not only reduce its GHG emissions, water consumption and waste, but also to track, analyze and report its progress toward carbon reduction goals.For IBM, everything starts with data, so our first step was to implement solutions that capture the right data and embed the sustainability and environmental impacts of our day-to-day decisions into our operations. Two integral tools that help IBM manage its real estate operations more effectively are the IBM TRIRIGA® solution for facilities management and the IBM Maximo® solution for asset management.Story continuesCharged with the sustainable management of over 50 million square feet of space under management, across some 800 locations in 100 countries, IBM GRE had a large potential to deliver change-and a large challenge. So IBM worked with process experts from IBM Consulting to create a plan for extracting and capturing sustainability and operational data automatically and in real time to enable better decision making.Our journey toward actionable insightsOnce the plan was set, we focused on building a consistent base of data, a ""single source of truth"" for all underlying facilities and assets. That consideration led to two major developments to help put this foundation in place.The first development was a close collaboration with the IBM Chief Data Office to build a new data governance program that aligns with IBM's enterprise data standards and emphasizes data ownership. The second step was GRE's decision to use sustainability performance management software from Envizi (now an IBM company) to help consolidate sustainability data (including key elements from TRIRIGA and Maximo) into a single, auditable system of record.The Envizi solution was selected based on its automation capabilities, its ease of integration with core systems like TRIRIGA and Maximo, and its ability to deliver dashboard-based insights that inform business strategy.Embedding insights into everyday operating decisionsA consistent data baseline allowed us to embed insights into everyday operating decisions. For example, using Maximo for data center maintenance, GRE analyzes sensor data to detect and fix problems before scheduled maintenance would find them. This eliminates the extra energy consumption, waste and emissions that invisibly failing parts would cause. Maximo also enables technicians to skip unnecessary repairs and avoid incidental carbon impacts like travel and parts shipping.This transformation is already paying offAs GRE's transformation continues to unfold, it's already achieving results. In 2021, IBM registered a 61.6% emission reduction against base year 2010, placing the company on track to meet its goal of a 65% reduction by 2025 (adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures). And with its recent investments, IBM is also improving its reporting capabilities. Replacing third-party tools with IBM's Envizi ESG Suite has enabled a roughly 30% reduction in reporting costs.Building a more sustainable organization requires strong partnerships and shared vision. At IBM, we lead by example and work with clients to turn that vision into a reality.

188,68a2744e-3217-3d07-b43f-463098ab2143,IBM,2022-12-22,Biggest CEO successes and setbacks: 2022’s triumphs and 2023’s challenges,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biggest-ceo-successes-setbacks-2022-121600911.html,1671624960,STORY,"['IBM', 'MSFT', 'BA', 'RTX', 'META', 'TSLA']","[It is that time of year again when we recognize five CEOs for their accomplishments in the last 12 months and spotlight five CEOs who will be under scrutiny in 2023.While many of last year’s winners such as GM’s Mary Barra and Honeywell’s Darius Adamczyk, along with Chris Kempczinski of McDonald's and Rodney McMullen of Kroger deserve honorable mention, here are our top five this year:1. Satya Nadella, Microsoft: Even Bill Gates is impressedDespite some short-term focus on the FTC’s antitrust suit against Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision, Satya Nadella deserves credit for fortifying Microsoft’s peerless position after years of arduous, successful transformation into a cloud platform business. Nadella successfully renewed and reignited Microsoft’s culture of innovation while integrating new product lines seamlessly into the company’s unrivaled legacy Windows platform.Microsoft founder Bill Gates provided these words of praise when we gave Nadella the Yale Legend in Leadership Award this month. “I still remember the presentation Satya gave to the board when we were picking Steve Ballmer’s successor”, said Gates. “We needed a high level of investment in cloud that was quite daunting, but Satya has delivered and has turned it into an extraordinary asset…it’s comforting to me that Microsoft is in such great hands”.Microsoft’s large footprint within the enterprise software space and its vast, flourishing product portfolio–which includes applications, platforms, and infrastructure and extends across Office, Azure, GitHub, Teams, gaming/metaverse, and other growth business lines–makes it truly unmatched amongst its technology peers.Microsoft now boasts a $60 billion+ commercial cloud business (including offerings such as Azure, Office365, Dynamics, and LinkedIn Commercial). Office 365 has a user base of 300 million users. Revenues from Azure grew 42% year-over-year and the commercial cloud business overall grew 20% year-over-year.Story continuesThis is possible not only because Nadella has constantly re-invested in R&amp;D, committing $25 billion annually, but also because he has strategically added nearly 50 companies to Microsoft’s portfolio through successful M&amp;A transactions with heavy investments in healthcare, manufacturing, and education, such as its $20 billion acquisition of Nuance in March 2022.Furthermore, Microsoft has struck partnerships with competing and adjacent vendors such as IBM, SAP, and Oracle to further Microsoft’s role as a holistic strategic partner across technology challenges rather than as a simple software vendor.As IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told us, “I am a great admirer of Satya. I’ve learned a lot watching him bridge the world of business and technology. He has focused on building new partnerships and expanding Microsoft’s ecosystem. A big lesson he has taught all of us is cooperation can be much more powerful than head-to-head competition, partnering with potential competitors grows the pie for everyone. I am proud IBM is a partner of Microsoft.”Since Nadella took over in 2014, Microsoft’s stock became one of the best-performing stocks in the index, up 1000%.Additionally, Nadella has led the effort to fortify trust in technology by defining the company’s success as driving economic and social surplus in every community where they operate, with a particular dedication to strengthening democracy and sustainability. Accordingly, the executive team’s compensation tracks progress on their commitment that by 2030, Microsoft will become a carbon-negative, water-positive, and zero-waste company.2. Arvind Krishna, IBM: Building out new businessesArvind Krishna, chief executive officer of International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), during a Bloomberg Technology television interview in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, July 13, 2022. Krishna said he expects business technology spending will remain robust even as recession fears escalate. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesArvind Krishna has accelerated IBM’s transformation into a leading provider of enterprise cloud solutions by combining its legacy portfolio of I.T. hardware, business, and I.T. services with a rapidly evolving full suite of software solutions. More than 50% of IBM's revenue is now linked to software and consulting solutions when just a few years ago IBM was still primarily known for its hardware business.On the software front, Krishna is building out synergies between the Red Hat integration and legacy IBM software assets. Just this year, Red Hat has gained new partners such as ABB and Dell, and IBM cloud seized market share from VMware and SAP.A focus on partnerships is one of the biggest changes since Krishna took over as CEO in 2020. Pipelines with AWS and Azure are $1 billion each, compared to no dialog two years ago. Nascent partnerships that are on pace to drive multi-billions of revenues include SAP, Palo Alto Networks, Zscaler, Adobe, and Salesforce.IBM is building out its consulting practice, which brings in steady fee-driven revenue, through acquisitions. In 2022, the company spent $1 billion on eight acquisitions, including four consulting acquisitions. Just this month, IBM acquired Octo, which adds 1,500 employees with expertise in A.I., cyber, cloud infrastructure, and data analytics, with a focus on consulting the U.S. federal government.IBM under Krishna is also building out its cybersecurity platform, including its acquisition of offensive cyber provider Randori this year.IBM is now moving into quantum computing development, announcing a 433-qubit “Osprey” processor in November, and investing in A.I. models–including an automated ordering pilot at McDonald’s across the country.3. Jane Fraser, Citi: Leading Citi out of old cities and into greener pasturesUNITED STATES - SEPTEMBER 21: Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, testifies during the House Financial Services Committee hearing titled Holding Megabanks Accountable: Oversight of Americas Largest Consumer Facing Banks, in Rayburn Building on Wednesday, September 21, 2022. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)Jane Fraser is executing the ambitious transformation agenda she laid out a year ago, selling off low-margin legacy international consumer businesses with difficult operating and political headwinds (such as in Russia, Korea, China, India, Mexico, Thailand, and Malaysia). This year alone, the selloff generated $3 billion of capital, with more to come next year.  Meanwhile, Fraser is making progress on re-orienting Citi’s core focus towards wealth management and U.S.-based personal banking.That turnaround strategy will take years to fully materialize–but Fraser deserves recognition for moving swiftly and efficiently right out of the gate, with the initial green shoots leading to votes of confidence from major shareholders, including Warren Buffett who opened a new position in Citi this year after discussions with Fraser. Citi has picked up market share in the wealth management space, with the number of new ultra-high-net-worth clients up 7% year-over-year and the number of new client advisors up 5% year-over-year, winning market share from European competitors such as Credit Suisse.The pivot away from international consumer businesses to wealth management is transforming Citi’s business from one dependent on net interest income, which is extremely macro-sensitive and fluctuates with interest rates, to one in which fees are the key driver of revenue growth, which provides a more stable, less cyclical, and more predictable source of revenue.Fraser has also completely re-engineered Citi’s internal risk control systems and technology after the embarrassing errant $500 million mistaken transfer to creditors of Revlon last year.4. Dave Calhoun, Boeing: Finally time for takeoff after a long tarmac delayDave Calhoun, chief executive officer of Boeing Co., speaks during a panel session on day two of the Qatar Economic Forum (QEF) in Doha, Qatar, on Wednesday, June 22, 2022. The second annual Qatar Economic Forum convenes global business leaders and heads of state to tackle some of the world's most pressing challenges, through the lens of the Middle East. Photographer: Christopher Pike/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesAfter years of severe challenges, starting with the 737 Max crisis to misfires with regulators to COVID-related demand destruction to Chinese order cancellations and the company’s cash crunch and high debt levels, Calhoun has finally guided Boeing to an inflection point where things are finally turning around.Global air travel has largely recovered. Airlines are now placing orders for new planes from Boeing at a record pace (United Airlines just ordered 100 787 and 100 MAX aircraft with an option for 100 additional 787s, the largest order in Boeing’s history). The MAX and 787 delivery and production rates are re-ramping up (400-450 MAX and 70-80 787s deliveries in 2023)­–and Boeing still has record backlogs (&gt;4,000 order backlog for the 737, 500 backlog for 787s). Cash flow has inflected into positive territory, with $2 billion in free cash flow in 2022, $3-$5 billion projected in 2023, and $10 billion by 2025.Not only has Boeing charted this return to profitability without needing a single airplane purchase from China–but this also takes the necessity of further cash raises off the table, so Boeing will not have to dilute its existing shareholders or add to its already high debt burden through additional debt issuances.Cash generation is on pace to exceed debt maturities over the next three years, with a path to restart shareholder capital returns. In fact, Boeing is projected to have $17 billion cash on hand by the end of next year.5. Greg Hayes, Raytheon: Providing defense support against TyrantsRaytheon CEO, Greg Hayes, attends a meeting between US President Joe Biden and business leaders and CEOs on the need to address the debt limit, on October 6, 2021, in the South Auditorium of the White House in Washington, DC. (Photo by Nicholas Kamm / AFP) (Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images)As the Russian invasion of Ukraine brings security and defense concerns to the forefront once again, defense companies are back in vogue with record earnings. Many European countries are accelerating their defense spending up to 2% of GDP, with most analysts calling for an era of secularly higher defense spending amidst heightened military competition. Raytheon has been perfectly positioned to benefit from these tailwinds, as military sales account for over 50% of revenues.The conflict in Ukraine has increased demand for best-in-class Raytheon weaponry including advanced air defense systems like NASAMS, the PATRIOT surface-to-air missile, as well as Raytheon’s legendary F-35 fighter jets.Raytheon just booked a $1 billion contract to develop a hypersonic attack cruise missile (HACM) and a $972 million contract for the Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM) for the Air Force. It has a $6.25 billion contract with Switzerland to deliver 36 F-35 jets. The company has a daunting $168 billion order backlog: Raytheon Missile &amp; Defense alone has an order backlog of $32 billion, while Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space has a backlog of $17 billion.One Raytheon division, Pratt &amp; Whitney, saw sales rise 15% year-over-year while another, Collins Aerospace, had 13% growth year-over-year.Raytheon has further consolidated market share gains in the aviation aftermarket with sales up 24% year-over-year.Stumbling CEOs:While the world was better off with the enterprises created by the ingenious Elon Musk, he is approaching a point of inflection where his righteous disdain for naysayers seems tone-deaf and destructive at Twitter, Tesla, and his other four enterprises. CZ of Binance and Sandeep Mathrani of WeWork also represent once high-flying enterprises that are approaching crash landings. Returning for encore appearances are Mark Zuckerberg of Meta/Facebook and Cathie Wood of Ark.1. Elon Musk, Tesla, Twitter, SpaceX, Boring Company, etc.: A new set of problems was not the vacation he neededGRUENHEIDE, GERMANY - MARCH 22: (Alternate crop of #1239417601) Tesla CEO Elon Musk contemplates during the official opening of the new Tesla electric car manufacturing plant on March 22, 2022 near Gruenheide, Germany. The new plant, officially called the Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, is producing the Model Y as well as electric car batteries. (Photo by Christian Marquardt - Pool/Getty Images)At our recent CEO Summit, we polled our gathering of 100+ top CEOs for their opinions on Musk’s challenges, and the results were not pretty.79% believe Elon Musk has become a detriment to the value of his businesses.69% believe Twitter’s best days are already behind it.Only 25% believe Twitter will be more valuable five years from now than it is today.98% believe Elon Musk overpaid for Twitter.56% believe companies should stop advertising on Twitter.41% believe people should stop using Twitter.This damning verdict from an audience of his CEO peers speaks to the tremendous pressure Musk is under. Facing increasing business challenges across both Twitter and Tesla due to his own mistakes, 2023 will make or break Musk.For years now, Musk has proven skeptics wrong by constantly defying established norms. But even geniuses have to know where their limits are–and it may well be that Musk has finally overreached with Twitter, with his insatiable yearning for attention proving to be his undoing.Attention is generally good for Musk’s businesses–but attention of the kind he is getting right now is not beneficial. His investors are getting spooked and spurning his requests for additional funds across both Twitter and Tesla. Users are leaving Twitter in droves amidst hate speech and indiscriminate censoring of journalists. Meanwhile, Tesla’s value has sunk 70% this year. Even if Musk finds a crony to install into the top job at Twitter, that is only the start, not the end, of more troubles, as his sweeping, grandiose visions collide with the realities of a world full of embittered and alarmed regulators, alienated investors, departed customers, and spurned corporate partners.The laundry list of promises Musk has failed to keep is striking. Where is that fleet of a million autonomous taxis announced five years ago and slated for delivery three years ago? Where is that world’s largest automotive insurance company he promised? Where are those underground tunnels the Boring Company hyped but never followed through on? Musk has less slack to afford misfires than ever before: nominally running six companies simultaneously with massive debt obligations to pay off, he has little margin for error as the walls close in around him.Of course, he is showing the stress of a wounded animal trapped in a corner slashing out in desperation. He tried to escape his legal commitment to buy Twitter and failed and now is failing in reviving the brand he trashed.  With the billionaire spread so thin, even with a 12-hour day he’d merely have 80 minutes per business to stay informed, solve problems, and take action. With fluid technologies and dynamic markets, that is, of course, a recipe for failure.2. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta/Facebook : A black hole of wealth destructionMark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Meta Platforms Inc., demonstrates the Meta Quest Pro during the virtual Meta Connect event in New York, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 11, 2022. Zuckerberg unveiled his company's newest virtual-reality headset, the Meta Quest Pro, the latest foray into the world of high-end VR devices that Meta Platforms hopes will entice creators and working professionals to adopt its vision for a virtual future. Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesMeta/Facebook under Mark Zuckerberg has spent $100 billion on R&amp;D related to the metaverse–and all it has to show are less than 200,000 metaverse users, a lost $800 billion in market capitalization, and $100 billion trimmed off Mark Zuckerberg’s fortune this year alone.Making matters worse, Meta’s splashy “Reels” debut has been underwhelming, with usership falling and “no substantive engagement” by the company’s own assessments.With Meta’s traditional Facebook platform rapidly losing ground against new competitors such as TikTok, Zuckerberg faces intense pressure in 2023 to show he has not lost his touch. When we surveyed 100 CEOs at our CEO Summit last week, 75% said they saw no commercial value in the metaverse for their own business this year.Making matters worse, Zuckerberg is no closer to solving lingering concerns surrounding inappropriate content, misinformation, toxic hate speech, and consumer privacy.Self-inflicted crises such as allegedly deceptive competitive practices did not help, nor did withering congressional hearings prompted by Frances Haugen’s whistleblowing disclosures, which highlighted the company’s malignant influence on political discourse, teen mental health, vaccine misinformation, and misuses of the platform by human traffickers and drug cartels.Adding to the challenges, Meta is now staring down investigations by EU and FTC regulators over antitrust violations with the EU commission poised to levy an $11.8 billion fine.3. ‘CZ’ Changpeng Zhao, Binance: Be careful what you wish forROME, ITALY - MAY 10: Founder and CEO of Binance Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as ""CZ"", attends the ""CZ meets Italy"" at Palazzo Brancaccio on May 10, 2022 in Rome, Italy. Changpeng Zhao is the founder and CEO of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume as of April 2018. (Photo by Antonio Masiello/Getty Images)CZ seems to be riding high after essentially single-handedly taking down his longtime rival, Sam Bankman-Fried. This leaves Binance as the undisputed largest crypto exchange–yet the downfall of FTX leaves landmines that now endanger CZ more than anyone else.Over the last few weeks, customers have already withdrawn billions of funds from Binance. The company contracted accounting firm Mazars to document its reserves, only to have Mazars swiftly withdraw and suspend all future work with Binance. Regulators from around the world are investigating Binance, while the days of crypto’s cross-border jurisdictional jumping seem to be coming to an end.The challenge for CZ is to reassure a skeptical and weary public that Binance’s books are clean–hardly an easy or enviable task given the ambiguities, jargon, and commingling of funds inherent to the crypto space–amidst widespread deterioration in crypto confidence.As governments and regulators contemplate seriously restrictive legislation around crypto assets, CZ has to engage policymakers from a position of weakness, having never cultivated political ties the way his vanquished rivals at FTX did. Perhaps in 2023, CZ may have cause to regret killing off his rival so mercilessly.4. Cathie Wood, ARK Investments: If a tree falls in the woods, would anyone be left to hear it?Cathie Wood, chief executive officer and chief investment officer, Ark Invest, speaks during the Milken Institute Global Conference on May 2, 2022 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Patrick T. FALLON / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)Even as Ark’s flagship ARKK ETF has sunk by 80% this year, Cathie Wood still sounds sanguine notes on her regular TV appearances, saying that now is the time to “bargain hunt”.It’s too bad that many of her “bargain picks” have only proceeded to crash even more, with some such as Invitae down 99%, others such as Coinbase and Twilio down 90%, and others staring down potential bankruptcy.Wood’s prognostications are shedding credibility as quickly as her investors are fleeing for the exits–and one cannot help but wonder if even her trademark pollyannaish media appearances may soon come to a close unless she finally accedes to reality and changes her tune.5. Sandeep Mathrani, WeWork: Will WeWork WeFail?MIAMI, FLORIDA - FEBRUARY 15: WeWork CEO, Sandeep Mathrani speaks on stage during Pivot MIA at 1 Hotel South Beach on February 15, 2022 in Miami, Florida. (Photo by Alexander Tamargo/Getty Images for Vox Media)Years after its founder Adam Neumann imploded in a blaze of scandal, WeWork may finally be circling the drain. Even after SoftBank sank $10 billion into the business, its cash reserves are rapidly dwindling as the company confronts more than $3 billion of debt and expensive long-term leases. WeWork’s largest clientele, tech companies, have been hit hard this year with many announcing job cuts. Financial markets are already pricing in WeWork’s imminent death with bonds trading at below 50 cents on the dollar.The challenge for Sandeep Mathrani is to right-size and transform WeWork’s business model into one that actually works–since the current one has never worked, even during times of lower interest rates and stronger economic activity. The growing popularity of remote work should, at least on paper, provide WeWork with some alternative monetization options.It is ironic the most successful CEOs of last year are understated, humble team-oriented leaders, while the stumbling CEOs indulged in a mix of grandiosity, bravado, and media-targeted hype.The best CEOs are happy to let performance speak for itself. The stumblers create razzle dazzle media to lure in innocents by exploiting their fear of missing out.

That's where a fuel storage facility also known as a ‘tank farm' operated by Marathon Pipe Line (MPL) is also home to a thriving pollinator habitat. Established in the spring of 2021, the Lima Area Pollinator Habitat includes over 30 acres of pollinator-friendly land to support a variety of wildlife, including butterflies and bees.Part of a company-wide effort by Marathon Petroleum to lead in sustainable energy, MPL is harnessing nature-based solutions to operate its pipelines safely while providing wildlife habitats for pollinating insects, migratory birds, a variety of aquatic and mammal wildlife, in addition to a diverse mix of wildflowers.""Building sustainable landscapes through a variety of measures is something that is very important to us,"" said Pete Thomas, Advanced Environmental Specialist at MPL. ""The Lima team not only did the research but applied what they learned while working with partners in the community to take this idea and turn it into a reality.""The project has exceeded the team's expectations as the habitat has grown exponentially in year two.""We are very pleased with the growth this year and all of the wildlife that came with it,"" said Pat Thompson, Lima Area Manager. ""Many of us live in the Lima area, and we want to optimize our pipeline station in ways that will benefit the community.""Story continuesLike the wildflowers, Thompson said the initiative is thriving and growing, with more pipeline stations wanting to take part.""We're learning along the way and sharing best practices,"" Thompson said.Building on Lima's success, MPL has added pollinator habitats in other areas, while testing out a different mix of seeds to foster even more growth. In addition to the flowering plants, employees have constructed nesting boxes for migrating birds and underwater structures for fish habitats in area ponds to support breeding seasons and promote a healthy nesting environment inside the pollinator habitat.""We thank our employees who have willingly and so graciously devoted their time and energy to this work and everyone involved for helping us make it the success it is today,"" said Ryan Korkos, MPL's Ohio Valley Region Manager.In addition to maintaining nearly 300 acres of certified wildlife habitat, the pipeline company established its first biodiversity goal for 2021 to apply sustainable landscapes to 50% of compatible rights of way by the end of 2025.With over 50,000 acres of pipeline rights of way, this goal is sure to have a positive impact on local vegetation and wildlife across MPL's national footprint.""While there is no formal goal established for in-station biodiversity efforts, our frontline workforce has taken this initiative to heart and made it a calling of their own,"" Korkos said.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Marathon Petroleum Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Marathon Petroleum CorporationWebsite: https://www.marathonpetroleum.com/Sustainability/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Marathon Petroleum CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/732876/From-Butterflies-to-Bees-Pollinator-friendly-Habitat-Creates-Buzz]"

It has 3 motors pumping out 1000 horsepower, features an 800-volt EV platform with massive Ultium battery (212.7 kWh), and has a range of around 350 miles.The Edition 1 costs a Hummer-size $112,839 as tested, but you do get a lot for the money. Cheaper versions of the Hummer EV will start at around $80,000, GMC (GM) says.The designGMC Hummer EV pickup (credit: Pras Subramanian)The big, bold exterior design of the Hummer in an exercise in non-restraint. One only need look at the massive light bar in the front with the glowing HUMMER EV printed on it. The truck is also over a foot wider than a Toyota Camry.The bruising, bold look starts at the front, which is unmistakable Hummer, hearkening back to the old H1 and H2 of years past. The hulking front end with nearly flat windshield—with three windshield wipers—flows back to the full-size four door cab, and features buttress-like C-pillars that form the upper part of the truck bed.GMC Hummer EV pickup (credit: Pras Subramanian)Our tester continued the out of this word look with two massive 35-inch off-road tires in the pickup bed, capped off with GMC’s MultiPro tailgate that can fold in several stages, with one part incorporating a KICKER audio system and speakers for outdoor tunes.GMC Hummer EV interior (credit: GMC)Inside the Hummer is all business - lots of right angles and hard edges, nothing rounded or curved to speak off. A prominent floating touchscreen display houses GMC’s infotainment system, which uses a Hummer specific graphical background design, mimicking the surface of the moon. There are other moon references in the vehicle, from the floor mats to the speaker covers, echoing what the GMC Hummer team dubbed their moonshot vehicle.Story continuesGMC Hummer EV pickup (credit: Pras Subramanian)The driveBefore picking up the Hummer, the thought of driving this thing—almost the size of a medium-duty commercial vehicle—on New York City streets was agita inducing.But hopping (literally) into the driver's seat and taking off didn’t prove as arduous as I imagined. The nearly 10,000-pound Hummer was somewhat nimble; its EV powertrain made accelerating and stopping with its regenerative braking system a smooth affair. Air suspension ate up potholes when encountered, and the vast array of cameras helped with visibility.Sure there were a couple scary moments when trying to weave through heavy traffic, or the all to common squeezing around a double-parked car on an NYC side street. But the Hummer includes rear-wheel steer to reduce its turning radius, and a party trick known as “crabwalk,” to maneuver when confines are tight, like on an off-road trail. (I actually used crabwalk to parallel park on a narrow city street.)But out of the city is where the Hummer shined. Sitting high up like a full-size pickup, the Hummer offers a commanding view of the road. With 1000 horsepower on tap, zooming past smaller cars and weaving around traffic felt like we were breaking the laws of physics.GMC Hummer EV pickup (credit: Pras Subramanian)Yes - it’s a capable truck, and we didn’t even have the chance to take if off road and use those 35-inch tires to good use. But the hummer is more than its physical presence. It’s GM’s way of showing what’s possible with EVs, and showing a skeptical public that an EV can be the biggest, baddest thing on the road.“Hummer bordered on an evil brand when GM finally retired it,” my co-pilot Newman said about the brand’s once reviled history. “Environmentalists despised it because it was so needlessly obnoxious, and it got single-digit mpg. It had to be the most inefficient vehicle there was when it stopped production in 2010.”But with the Hummer being all electric, those legacy issues are now gone. “It still might be inefficient, but there are no greenhouse gasses coming out the back,” Newman added. “They’re taking a sin brand and turning it into a virtuous brand.”And that might be GM’s real moonshot. Taking the Hummer brand out of the dustbin of history, and making it king of the hill across all of GM’s truck offerings - electric or not.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Just the latest in a long list of issues, but really-- it's really just an ugly car to begin with.- There was another fire issue, remember, regarding the battery that triggered an earlier recall. So now there's a fire from a different source. Yes, indeed, that the seatbelt can somehow have some sort of exhaust that can catch fire to the rug in the back.- My goodness.- I don't really know.- Yeah, the previous recall was the battery pack and the electric propulsion. This particular recall is going to affect about 119,000 vehicles in the US and about 20,000 vehicles in Canada as well.- Not only you have to look-- worry about looking bad. You have to worry about going up in flames. So it's just-- it's-- nah, just not a fan of the car at all.- Well, obviously the people are buying it. They don't think that they--- Well, maybe they should. They should do Yahoo searches.- --look bad.

196,9bcaa53c-bb39-35d7-bb05-2c8801b314ac,MKC,2022-12-22,Hershey (HSY) Up on Solid Brands & Pricing Amid Rising Costs,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hershey-hsy-solid-brands-pricing-164604792.html,1671641164,STORY,"['HSY', 'MKC-V', 'CHEF']","[The Hershey Company HSY is on track with strategic acquisitions and consumer-friendly innovation to boost portfolio strength. The global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery is benefiting from effective pricing actions amid rising inflation.Let’s delve deeper.Buyouts &amp; Innovations Boosting PortfolioHershey has been undertaking buyouts to augment portfolio strength and boost revenues. In December 2021, Hershey acquired Dot’s Pretzels LLC — the owner of Dot’s Homestyle Pretzels, a leading brand in the pretzel category. The addition of Dot’s Pretzels is a perfect match for Hershey’s growing salty snacking portfolio. The company also purchased Pretzels Inc. from an affiliate of Peak Rock Capital. The acquisition further expands Hershey’s snacking and production capabilities. On Jun 25, 2021, Hershey concluded the acquisition of Lily's, a leading better-for-you (BFY) confectionery brand. The buyout is in tandem with Hershey’s focus on creating an impressive BFY confection portfolio as part of its multi-pronged, better-for-you snacking strategy.In the third quarter of 2022, net sales included a 4.1-point benefit from the Pretzels and Dot's buyouts. The impact of Pretzels, Dot's and Lily's buyouts is likely to add a 4-5 point benefit to net sales.Hershey regularly brings innovation to its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. The company anticipates momentum to continue into the Holiday season, with its products already out in stores and selling well. In addition, it is committed to supporting brands through solid media marketing. An important strategy of the company is to create a unique and holistic portfolio for every season, which can meet consumers’ seasonal shopping needs.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWill Cost Hurdles be Countered?In the third quarter of 2022, Hershey’s adjusted gross margin came in at 42.5%, down 180 basis points (bps). The downside was caused by raw material, packaging and logistics inflation and labor investments. Increased supply chain costs stemming from sustained consumer demand also hurt the metric. In addition, an unfavorable mix from recent buyouts was a hurdle. These factors were somewhat offset by net price realization and volume gains.For 2022, management expects the adjusted gross margin to decline by nearly 120 bps. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it expects the operating environment to remain dynamic in 2023. The company anticipates high single-digit cost inflation for commodities, packaging, logistics, wages and other general operating expenses. That being said, the focus on strategic pricing actions is helping Hershey mitigate the impacts of rising inflation.We note that Hershey is undertaking strategic pricing initiatives to improve its performance. In third-quarter 2022, net price realization contributed 7.7 points to net sales growth. In the North America Confectionery segment, net price realization contributed 7.7 points to net sales. In the North America Salty Snacks segment, net price realization contributed 12.5 points to net sales growth. Price realization contributed 4.4 points to sales in the International unit.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 24.7% in a year compared with the industry’s 19.9% growth.Story continues3 Solid Food PicksSome better-ranked stocks are The Chef's Warehouse CHEF, Conagra Brands CAG and McCormick &amp; Company MKC.The Chef's Warehouse, which distributes specialty food products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

AAL recently announced that it is putting an end to its 30-year-long collaboration with Mesa Air Group, Inc. MESA.Mesa Air will stop flying American Airlines’ flights from Apr 3, 2023. Also, Mesa Air is actively involved in signing a new five-year deal with United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (UAL). Accordingly, Mesa Air will shift its operations from AAL to UAL from March 2023.With this new deal, UAL will start using Mesa Air’s existing crews. The new contract will also allow Mesa Air to open a crew base in Houston and a new pilot base in Denver, with the potential for other incremental crew bases.Mesa Air used to operate regional flights for both United Airlines and American Airlines and had witnessed profitability even during the initial days of the pandemic when the majority of airline companies faced quarterly losses. However, Mesa Air was unfavorably impacted by the industry-wide pilot shortage issue. As a result, Mesa Air was unable to operate all of its contracted flights with American Airlines.Derek Kerr, American Airlines’ CFO, stated, “As a result, we have concerns about Mesa’s ability to be a reliable partner for American going forward. American and Mesa agree the best way to address these concerns is to wind down our agreement.”Mesa Air CEO Jonathan Ornstein stated, “Once finalized, our expanded agreement with United is expected to both solidify our operations and, in conjunction with our amended agreements with key stakeholders, significantly improve our financial position.”He further added, “Most importantly, after years of reduction in service to smaller and rural communities, this agreement will help turn the tide and is expected to add over 100 regional jet flights into the United network.”Further, Mesa Air has inked another deal with United Airlines, wherein Mesa Air pilots will be able to participate in UAL’s career development programs. This should help Mesa Air hire and retain more pilots and provide them with a better career.Story continuesWe believe that the deal termination with AAL and signing a new deal with UAL should create more opportunities for Mesa Air and enhance it financially.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, both American Airlines and Mesa Air carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

But it's a challenge PNC embraces every year when it bestows its highest employee honor to recipients of the Performance Award.PNC's values - Customer Focus, Diversity and Inclusion, Integrity, Performance, Quality of Life, Respect and Teamwork - have served as guides for the Performance Award selection committee as it has typically chosen eight winners every year since 1993. Most years, more than 600 candidates are nominated by their PNC colleagues.""When it comes to employee engagement, and the things that matter and keep you at a company, this honor is pretty hard to top,"" said Vicki Henn, PNC's chief human resources officer and a past Performance Award winner. ""I think it says a lot that most of our previous winners are still with PNC.""The award affirms to others that the winners have contributed a lot and have the ability to contribute even more. When I won the Performance Award, it was clear to me that PNC was willing to invest in me and my career, wherever that may have taken me in the organization.""The selection committee consists of representatives from across PNC, as well as the previous year's award winners. New representatives are rotated into the process every couple of years.Selections are based on three criteria: business impact, which usually includes a quantitative measure of success; leadership and teammate engagement, which attests to the scope of the nominee's influence; and community involvement, which is not required but often serves as proof of the nominee's well-rounded activities.Nominations are reviewed in successive waves by committee members who work in the same area of the company as the nominee as well as by those who work elsewhere within PNC.Story continuesCommittee members offer expertise when they evaluate someone from their own world - a wealth management leader might explain the impact of a fiduciary advisor, for example.Often the strongest arguments for winners and finalists come from members who know little about the specific business roles and responsibilities of the nominees but care passionately about serving customers, colleagues and communities.Showcasing the best of the best of PNC's 52,000 employees in order to inspire others is a key part of the Performance Award ceremony, where the winners give moving speeches about their career pathways and experiences.Other PNC awards programs recognize employees for top sales performance and customer service. All are part of PNC's talent-focused culture, which is centered on having the right employees in the right roles at the right time, doing their best work.

ISRG need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $126.67 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Intuitive Surgical shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Intuitive Surgical is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Medical - Instruments industry that ranks in the Top 39% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.24 per share to $1.27 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Intuitive Surgical right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on CSX is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$5.8b ÷ (US$42b - US$2.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, CSX has an ROCE of 15%.  By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 15%. Check out our latest analysis for CSX roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for CSX compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For CSX Tell Us?CSX is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 31% in that same time. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On CSX's ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that CSX has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. Since the stock has returned a solid 82% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for CSX  that we think you should be aware of.While CSX may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

There are several different kinds of banks and investment organizations that cater to the needs of different clients. Zooming in on the banking sector, retail banks are those that offer services to regular users and small businesses. They are smaller in size and have less stringent capital requirements.However, just because they offer retail services doesn't mean that the banks have to be small. For example, some global behemoths with retail banking divisions are JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). These banks also provide corporate banking and investment management services, which end up overlapping their roles with those offered by mutual funds and hedge funds. However, hedge funds differ from the rest since most of their investments come through leverage. Imagine getting $100 in investor capital and using it to borrow $1,000 to invest.Moving down the ladder, we come across regional banks. These banks often operate in some regions of a country, as opposed to national banks that have a larger presence. The primary difference is in the form of an asset base - with regional banks generally having up to $100 billion in capital according to the Federal Reserve. These banks typically offer the same kinds of services to their customers as their larger peers, but also have the advantage of wider coverage within the region that they operate. For instance, it might be easier to find a Signature Bank ATM in Fayetteville, Arkansas, than a JPMorgan ATM.According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), there were 4,750 community banks in the U.S. in 2019 - after dropping from the 6,802 banks in 2016. While community banks are generally thought to be smaller, the FDIC data set also includes those classified as regional on the stock market. The latest data from the government agency lists down 4,747 regional banks, with the largest in terms of assets after the big four JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), being U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) with a massive asset base of $591 billion.Story continuesTop 25 Regional Bank Stocks in the U.S.Photo by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe sifted through the hundreds of regional bank stocks that are traded on American exchanges and over the counter to sift out those that offer banking services to U.S. customers.

If you want to read about some more BNPL companies, go directly to 5 Biggest BNPL Companies In The World.Digital payment options have gained immense popularity in recent years. These payment options are more popular in Europe and US, but are gaining prominence in Asia, Australia and New Zealand as well. With the rise of digital payments, there has also been a marked increase in the use of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) applications. Buy Now, Pay Later is basically short-term financing that allows consumers to make purchases and pay for them later through interest free installments. Many BNPL companies have emerged over the years, offering digital payment services to customers and merchants around the world. The BNPL companies charge retailers a fee, which is between 3% and 6% of BNPL sales, and this cost is likely to be passed onto consumers.  BNPL apps are the latest financial tools which make it easier for customers to access credit for the products they have bought. These apps integrate with retail stores, allowing the customers to carry on shopping activities conveniently and settle the bill offsite with deferred methods. Some of the top firms in this space include Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), among others discussed in detail below. The global BNPL market size is expected to expand up to $20.40 billion by 2028. It is important to note that since the global pandemic struck, the buying patterns of customers have changed drastically. It is also noteworthy that almost 75% of BNPL users are Generation Z or millennials, and they are more cautious about credit in times of financial crisis. The global BNPL market was valued at $15.91 billion in 2021. The market is projected to grow from $22.86 billion in 2022 to $90.51 billion by 2029, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate of 21.7% during the forecast period of 2022 to 2029. The global BNPL market exhibited a higher growth of 48.3% in 2020 due to the global pandemic. The US tops the BNPL market. According to recent research, BNPL users in the country have increased by 300% since 2018, with 45 million users in 2021.Story continuesThe leading players in BNPL are offering various services for categories such as travel and tourism, online shopping, consumer electronics, retail, healthcare insurances, banking and financial services. Further, several e-commerce companies across retail, banking and healthcare insurance are adopting this service to facilitate customers around the globe.

We discussed Affirm in our Q4 letter, saying the following:Affirm is a “Buy Now, Pay Later” (BNPL) company founded by former PayPal CTO and cofounder Max Levchin. They provide installment loans to consumers, partnering with retail companies looking to drive higher sales. They have two primary products: a zero-fee installment loan for consumers with the best credit scores, and a more traditional product with 20%+ interest rates for subprime borrowers. Their stated plan is to disrupt the credit industry with more transparent, lower-fee loans. At a roughly $28b market cap at the start of 2022, AFRM stock was priced at more than 20x trailing sales, a steep price for a money-losing lender. While their early lead in online BNPL transactions and partnerships with fast-growing retailers like Peloton has fueled significant historical growth, a wave of competition has arrived… While the stock has already fallen sharply from where we initiated our short position, we think it could fall another ~40% to trade at 8x FY2022 sales.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest BNPL Companies In The World. Suggested Articles:11 Best Low Risk Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

The greenback was also dented by growing bets that U.S. inflation has peaked, which could invite a slower pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.Spot gold rose 0.2% to $1,818.58 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,827.45 an ounce by 20:08 ET (01:08 GMT). The yellow metal was trading up 1.5% for the week, and was close to a five-month high.Markets are now awaiting revised U.S. GDP data for the third quarter. A preliminary reading showed that the economy grew a better-than-expected 2.9% in the September quarter, with analysts forecasting the figure to remain the same in its first revision due later in the day.Focus this week is squarely on the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditure price index, which is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge. The core index is expected to have eased further in November from the prior month.But the index still remains well above the Fed’s annual target range, indicating that the central bank still needs to tighten policy further to curb inflation.The prospect of rising interest rates in developed markets is likely to keep gold prices subdued in the coming months, with the Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and the Bank of England also sending hawkish messages.Other precious metals rose on Thursday, although their outlook also remains clouded. Focus this week is also on consumer inflation data from Japan, especially after the BOJ somewhat tightened policy after nearly a decade of accommodative measures.Among industrial metals, copper prices surged on more signs of an economic reopening in China, even as the country grapples with a massive spike in COVID-19 cases.Story continuesCopper futures rose 0.7% to $3.8425 a pound and were set to gain over 2% this week.But prices of the red metal are still trading lower for the year, with their outlook remaining uncertain in the face of rising interest rates and a potential recession.Related ArticlesGold holds recent gains as markets await GDP, inflation readingsOil rallies on tight U.S. stocks as winter blast hitsChampagne makers celebrate record sales ahead of Christmas]"

The peso gained 1.8% against the dollar, tracking its best one-day percentage gain in two weeks as prices of the red metal moved higher, shrugging off worries that a recent surge in coronavirus infections in China was reducing consumption in the short term. Chile, which is the world's biggest producer of copper, relies heavily on demand from China, whose zero-COVID policy disrupted economic activity and pulled the industrial metal from a record high. The Chilean currency is on track for its second straight yearly decline, down more than 2%. ""China’s announcement of measures to lower financial costs for businesses adds to the idea that 2023 will be a major recovery year for trade and overcoming the supply-chain woes that have aided inflation worldwide,"" said Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex. Latin American stocks rose 0.6%, outpacing the broader emerging markets. Higher exposure to commodities have helped certain emerging markets more than others, with Latam stocks set to end the year flat against a near-23% plunge in the MSCI's broader EM index . Mexico's peso rose 0.7% tracking firm oil prices. The Colombian peso was subdued on Wednesday and is down 14.6% so far this year, underperforming its regional peers. In Peru, President Dina Boluarte named lawyer Alberto Otarola as the new prime minister as part of a reshuffling of her cabinet. The sol rose 0.1%, while stocks index in Lima was flat. Boluarte was vice president until she replaced then-President Pedro Castillo earlier this month, who was removed from office and then detained after illegally trying to dissolve congress. Peru on Tuesday gave Congress the provisional green light to bring forward a general election to the end of 2023, amid deadly protests over the impeachment of Castillo. ""The approval is positive in the sense that it caters to growing pressures from the population and allows time for potential political reform changes that could limit the common stalemate between congress and executive branches,"" Citi strategists wrote in a client note. Brazil's real edged up against a firm dollar. Data showed the country's federal tax revenue totaled 172.038 billion reais ($33.29 billion) in November, a 3.25% growth in real terms over the same month last year. Sao Paulo stocks rose 0.5%, with a 27.2% jump in Brazilian reinsurer IRB Brasil Resseguros SA leading gains after it posted a monthly profit in October. Argentina's economic activity expanded 4.5% in October from a year earlier, the country's official statistics agency said, in line with a recent Reuters poll.

The OZ board had last month accepted BHP’s offer, and recommended it to shareholders.The deal is also subject to regulatory approvals in Australia, Brazil, Vietnam.After being rejected in its first approach to OZ earlier this year, BHP made a higher cash offer of A$28.25 per share in November, as it looks to enlarge its interests in copper and nickel mining.The move comes as BHP pivots further away from fossil fuels and into what it sees as a future of clean energy.Copper and nickel are integral parts of clean energy infrastructure, and have seen increased demand in recent years amid the growing popularity of electric cars and renewable energy.The deal will position BHP as one of the largest copper producers in the world, with the world’s largest miner forecasting a spike in demand for the red metal in the coming years.OZ Mineral holds projects close to BHP’s Olympic Dam mine in South Australia, which is also why the Anglo-Australian miner is seeking to integrate the firm into its holdings.BHP plans to fund the deal through a mix of cash and by taking on new debt.The deal is the largest mining deal in Australia since BHP’s purchase of Petrohawk Energy Corp in 2011 for $12.1 billion.But BHP has since then sold all of its oil and gas assets to Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum, and has also trimmed the size of its coal businesses. The mining giant also expects demand for its key iron ore exports to plateau in the coming years.Shares of BHP and OZ Minerals were trading slightly higher in early trade.Related ArticlesStory continuesMining giant BHP Group finalizes $6.4 bln offer for OZ MineralsAsia shares join Wall St bounce, yen keeps climbingModerna's vaccine facility in Britain to create over 150 new jobs]"

BHP made its first offer to acquire 100% of the issued share capital in OZ Minerals Limited for AUD25 per share on Aug 7, 2022. OZ Minerals’ Board had rejected the offer citing that it undervalues the company and was not in the best interests of shareholders.On Nov 18, BHP raised its offer price to A$28.25 per share which represented a 49.3% premium to OZ Minerals’ closing price on Aug 5, 2022 — the last trading day prior to BHP’s initial proposal.OZ Mineral’s board had then confirmed to BHP that it intended to recommend the revised offer to the company’s shareholders. The parties had entered into a Confidentiality and Exclusivity Deed under which BHP had four weeks to undertake due diligence and negotiate a binding scheme implementation agreement reflecting the key terms of the revised proposal. Now that the due diligence has been duly completed, OZ Minerals has extended the period to next week so that BHP can finalize the terms. The terms of the scheme implementation deed however remain subject to both the companies’ Board approval.OZ Minerals owns and operates Prominent Hill, a high-quality copper-gold mine, and Carrapateena, an iron-oxide-copper–gold underground mine, both located in the highly prospective Gawler Craton in South Australia. The Carajás East Hub located in Brazil is also part of its portfolio. This hub comprises the Pedra Branca underground mine, which is the beginning of a potential series of small, high-quality copper-gold mines with ore being processed at existing facilities at the nearby, now-depleted Antas mine.This deal, which values OZ Minerals at AUD9.6 billion ($6.34 billion),  would add to BHP’s pipeline of growth options and enhance its exposure to future-facing commodities like copper and nickel, while adding attractive synergies. BHP has been lately focusing on building its capabilities in commodities like copper, nickel and potash to ride on growing global trends such as decarbonization, electrification, population growth and rising living standards in developing countries among others.The combination will also help BHP unlock potential operational synergies in South Australia as OZ Minerals’ Carrapateena and Prominent Hill mines are in proximity to the Olympic Dam and Oak Dam development resources. OZ Mineral’s West Musgrave project will add a large greenfield nickel option to BHP’s Nickel West premier nickel sulfide resource position in Western Australia.Story continuesPrice PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBHP Group’s shares have gained 3.9% over the past year compared with the industry’s 4.5% decline.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderBHP currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/E.Verizon Communications hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. It seems that many are expecting the dour earnings performance to persist, which has repressed the P/E. If this is the case, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Verizon Communications.How Is Verizon Communications' Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as low as Verizon Communications' is when the company's growth is on track to lag the market.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 14%. Regardless, EPS has managed to lift by a handy 18% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the earlier period of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 4.5% per year over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.1% growth per annum, the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.With this information, we can see why Verizon Communications is trading at a P/E lower than the market. Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.We've established that Verizon Communications maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast growth being lower than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Verizon Communications that you should be aware of.If P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly and trade on P/E's below 20x.Have feedback on this article?

One arm, responsible for the development of discrete Graphics Processor Units (GPUs), will slot under Intel’s client computing group. The other, high-performance computing (HPC) accelerators, will join its data center and artificial intelligence business.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureThe restructuring of the graphics chips business signals Intel’s intention to renew efforts to take on Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). The market leader in integrated GPUs—where the graphics card is part of the CPU, a product where Intel also leads—has failed to make a mark in the discrete GPU (dGPU) space.Charted: Nvidia is winning in dGPUsdatawrapper-chart-m4sg8Intel trails Nvidia in discrete graphics cardsThe AXG group, formed in 2016, has so far guzzled $3.5 billion with little to show for it—especially when it comes to the development of dGPUs, which has been growing in demand among PC and laptop gamers, and has several other use cases in banking, automotives, and more.Intel’s foray into graphics cards earlier this year, after a 24-year-hiatus from the space, didn’t go smoothly—software problems crippled its hardware sales. It remedied the code causing the snag, and is not looking to get an even bigger piece of the discrete graphics card pie.Intel not only continues to be overshadowed by market leader Nvidia, but it’s also struggling to match semiconductor company AMD, the rapidly rising innovator.In July, analyst Jon Peddie said Intel should probably dump the AXG group as part of its austerity measures. In the six years since it was formed, “AMD and Nvidia have brought out three generations of new and stunningly powerful dGPUs, and more are in the pipeline. Four new companies have started up in China, and two new ones announced in the US. Intel is now facing a much stronger AMD and Nvidia, plus six start-ups—the rules of engagement have dramatically changed while Intel sunk money into projects it can’t seem to get off the ground,” Peddie wrote in his blogpost.Story continuesBut it doesn’t look like Intel is axing the business just yet. “Discrete graphics and accelerated computing are critical growth engines,” it said yesterday. “We are evolving our structure to accelerate and scale their impact and drive go-to-market strategies with a unified voice to customers.”Person of interest: Raja KoduriRaja Koduri came to Intel in 2017, armed with experience from iPhone maker Apple and chips company AMD. Most recently, he was leading the graphic chips unit that was just bifurcated and reorganized. With the recent shakeup, he’s poised to return to his role as chief architect to oversee the company’s long-term technology and chip design strategy.One more thing: Intel and other chip makers are strugglingIntel, which plans to cut $10 billion in costs through 2025, has had to make some tough calls in the middle of “continued macroeconomic headwinds.” In the middle of 2022, it shut down its Optane memory, suffering a $559 million inventory write-off in the process. Come early 2023, it will lay off 200-odd employees.Chipmaker Micron Technology announced yesterday (Dec. 21) that it will lay off 10% of its staff and cut spending as it falls prey to several headwinds including high inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions and China’s covid policies, and more.Related stories👨‍💻 Gamers are going to great lengths to find graphics cards in a chip shortage📌 How Intel became Biden’s main marketing tool for the US innovation bill🚗 The Mobileye IPO can’t save Intel-in-distressMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Nvidia NVDA and Taiwan Semiconductor TSM remain at the top of the semiconductor food chain in terms of diversity.Let’s see which of these semiconductor leaders could be the better investment going into 2023. Brief Overview Nvidia is renowned for its invention of graphic processing units (GPUs) with its range of expertise in the data center, professional visualization, and gaming markets.While there are not many semiconductor companies that can compete with Nvidia’s broad range of dominance, Taiwan Semiconductor is a viable opponent in this regard.Taiwan Semiconductor is the world’s largest dedicated integrated circuit foundry. Founded in 1987, the company manufactures integrated circuits for its customers based on their proprietary designs with one of its most notable clients being Apple AAPL.Taiwan Semiconductor produces the chips used In Apple’s iPhones, iPods, and Mac computers. Furthermore, Taiwan Semiconductor assists with the production of over 12,300 products for over 535 clients worldwide. Pleasantly, Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor aren’t competitors. In fact, Nvidia itself is a customer of Taiwan Semiconductor and has collaborated with the company in manufacturing the graphic chips it designs.Performance &amp; Valuation Taiwan Semiconductor is down -36% in 2022 vs. Nvidia’s -44%. Both stocks have underperformed the S&amp;P 500’s -21% and the Nasdaq’s -31% performances. Over the last decade, NVDA’s total return including dividends is a staggering +5,364% to easily beat TSM and the broader indexes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $165 per share, NVDA currently trades at 72X earnings. In contrast, TSM trades at $77 a share and just 11.9X earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEven better, TSM trades 65% below its decade-long high of 34.4X and at a 25% discount to the median of 15.9X. NVDA is 23% below its decade high of 93.5X but 92% above the median of 37.4X.Story continuesTaiwan Semiconductor definitely looks like the better investment from a valuation standpoint going into the new year. Looking at the growth of both companies will be essential with the economy still very challenging for semiconductors and the broader technology sector.Growth Nvidia earnings are now expected to drop -26% in its current fiscal 2023 at $3.27 per share. This is down from $4.44 a share in 2021. However, FY24 earnings are projected to rebound 34% at $4.37 a share. Earnings estimate revisions have declined for both FY23 and FY24 over the last 90 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSales are forecasted to be virtually flat in FY23 and rise 9% in FY24 to $29.42 billion. Fiscal 2024 would be an impressive 151% increase from pre-pandemic sales of $11.71 billion in 2019.Looking at Taiwan Semiconductor, earnings are anticipated to climb an impressive 54% this year and then decline -9% in FY23 at $5.76 per share. Earnings estimates have gone up for FY22 but have trended down for FY23 over the last quarter. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the top line, sales are projected to jump 27% in 2022 and rise another 7% in FY23 at $77.31 billion. FY23 would represent 129% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $35.77 billion. This is very impressive for a company that has been around for over a quarter century.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line Going into 2023, Taiwan Semiconductor appears to be the better investment at the moment. TSM sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in correlation with rising earnings estimate revisions for its current fiscal 2022 with stellar bottom line growth expected.On the other hand, Nvidia stock lands a Zack Rank #4 (Sell) at the moment with earnings estimates declining for its current fiscal 2023 which is already expected to be a down year.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A sharp drop in gaming sales, softness in the data center business and the constraints put on the exports of state-of-the-art data center chips to China have all been issues the company has had to contend with.The result has been a stock that has shaved 44% off its value, a worse showing than the SOX’s (the major semiconductor index) 33% drop.But with 2023 now clearly in view, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill thinks it’s time to look at the chip giant in a new light. In fact, heading into the new year, such is Gill’s confidence in a turnaound, he has designated Nvidia with 'Top Pick' status.Explaining his stance, the 5-star analyst said, “As we exit one of the semiconductor industry's most volatile years, investors should focus on companies where both the consensus estimates and the end-markets have largely corrected.”And for Nvidia, they most certainly have. The graphics segment has dropped ~30% year-over-year, while China data center has fallen at a similar rate.Yet, Gill thinks we are “approaching a bottom in the gaming segment” in C1Q23. And while the analyst thinks volatility could indeed be in the cards for the overall data center market next year, he believes NVDA’s clients are “upgrading to the latest H100 architecture.”As for EPS consensus estimates, for CY23, these have come down by 31% over the past year, with “underutilization” also negatively impacting them. “NVIDIA took large inventory charges ($1.22BN in F2Q and $702MM in F3Q) related to the weaker gaming and crypto outlook,” Gill noted. “That headwind could abate and reflect higher margins not currently built into estimates.” There’s also been a 20% drop in CY23 sales estimates.But based on the “transition to AI workloads and the adoption of new products (H100, Grace, Thor etc.),” Gill is expecting growth to accelerate in CY23 and CY24 and this sets up the company nicely.Story continuesWith this in mind, Gill bumped his price target on NVDA from $200 to $230, making room for 12-month returns of 39%. The 5-star analyst’s rating stays a Buy. (To watch Gill’s track record, click here)Most other Street analysts remain in NVDA’s corner; based on 22 Buys, 6 Holds and 1 Sell, the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Investors will be sitting on returns of ~23%, should the $202.33 average target be met a year from now.

If you want to read about some more tech stocks for long term investment, go directly to 5 Best Tech Stocks For Long Term Investment.In no era of human history have business and technology been so inextricably linked as they are in the present times. The significance of this can be gauged from a recent report that outlines the six trending industries in 2022. All of these overlap with the technology space. The industries include space tech, bio tech, neuro tech, robot tech, climate tech, and energy tech. These trends were witnessed despite a broad macro slowdown at the market which favored value stocks as investors reevaluate their risk profiles in light of recession fears. According to analysts, the tech industry remains a robust choice for business growth and career advancement in 2022. As per a recent report, the information technology market grew from $8,384.32 billion in 2021 to $9,358.51 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate of 11.6%. This growth came despite the pandemic, the Russia Ukraine war, and economic uncertainties. Looking forward into 2023, these growth trends are likely to accelerate as the economy recovers from a tumultuous 2022. Investors should monitor long-term trends in the tech space, like the optimizing of IT systems for greater reliability, maintaining the value integrity of production AI systems and scaling vertical offerings, as well as the accelerating strategies to tap new virtual markets. Digital immune systems, applied observability, AI trust, risk and security management, industry clouds platform, platform engineering, wireless value realization, super apps, adaptive AI, metaverse, and sustainable technology are all also sectors investors should keep a close eye on. Some of the top stocks in the tech sector for the long term include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). Analysts have urged leading technology providers to play a top role in helping enterprises use innovative technologies to slide through the current storms of disruption. The use of tech as a safe haven in times of recession, especially in the services sector, is also likely to rise in the coming years. Story continuesSource:PixabayOur MethodologyThe companies that have long-term growth catalysts and operate in the tech sector were selected for the list. Special importance was assigned to outlining the basic business fundamentals and analyst ratings for each firm to provide readers with some context so they can make more informed investment choices. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Best Tech Stocks For Long Term Investment12. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40 International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) provides integrated solutions and services worldwide. On December 13, the firm announced that it had signed a deal with Rapidus to work on developing the breakthrough 2 nanometer node technology of the former for implementation in Japan by the latter. The US government plans to invest hundreds of billions in chip firms over the next few years to shore up chip manufacturing in the country. As the demand for electronics and electric vehicles rises, so will the demand for chips. IBM can jump on this growth curve by investments in the chip space. On October 18, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan maintained a Buy rating on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stock and lowered the price target to $145 from $155, noting that it has been estimated that about 80% of the software portfolio is non-transactional contracts linked to mission-critical projects.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Boston-based investment firm Arrowstreet Capital is a leading shareholder in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) with 4.3 million shares worth more than $515.8 million. Just like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the best tech stocks for long term investment. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, St. James Investment Company, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was not the first company to build computers. The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department in the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.One cannot overstate how powerful IBM was in the computer industry in the 1950s and 1960s. Every competitor rightly worried that if their product worked too well for too long, it was only a matter of time before an army of IBM salesforce representatives mobilized. In their easily recognizable uniforms of starched white shirts, red ties and blue suits, IBM marketers marched on their customers and offered a more expensive, but much more defensible, choice. “Nobody gets fired for buying IBM” was a common phrase. Even competitors acknowledged that the company excelled at sales. As a UNIVAC executive once complained, ‘It doesn’t do much good to build a better mousetrap if the other guy selling mousetraps has five times as many salesmen.’” (read more)11. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69    Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, manufactures and sells computer products and technologies worldwide. On November 18, Intel revealed that it has introduced its real-time DeepFake detector, FakeCatcher. This Deep Fake detector analyzes the blood flow in the video pixels to return results in milliseconds with an accuracy of 96%. The product is just one example of the growth path that the firm has in different sectors, like video editing and news dissemination, as the demand for powerful chips rises. The company, one of the leading US-based plays in the semi space, is also a reliable dividend player for the long term. On October 31, Citi analyst Christopher Danely maintained a Neutral rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock and lowered the price target to $27 from $30, noting that the company reported mixed results and guided well below consensus driven by the PC downturn.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 69 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.9 billion in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 65 in the preceding quarter worth $2.5 billion.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”10. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74   Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. On December 5, Micron Technology revealed that its mobile memory chip, low-power double data rate 5X (LPDDR5X), is gaining market traction with the validation of its mobile memory for Qualcomm Technologies’ latest mobile platform for flagship smartphones. The smartphone market is one of the biggest businesses in the world. Billions of people own smartphones and are increasingly reliant on these machines for many basic tasks. Micron, whose chips power these phones, has a steady avenue of growth in the smartphone space for the long-term. On October 7, Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers maintained an Overweight rating on Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stock and lowered the price target to $70 from $75, noting that it won’t be surprising to see shares trading lower ahead of the upcoming first-quarter earnings release.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 74 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.5 billion in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”9. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88   Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, and energy generation and storage systems. On September 30, Tesla launched the prototype of its humanoid robot named Dubbed Optimus. This launch has set a mark on reshaping the future of physical work using artificial intelligence. The company said that the robot is running on its Self-Driving computer. Over the years, the firm has distinguished itself in the electric vehicle space through the use of cutting-edge software that competitors are often lacking. The foray into robotics underscores the innovation-driven values of the firm which have helped it build such a strong profile in the EV space. On December 13, Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney maintained a Buy rating on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock and lowered the price target to $235 from $305, noting that it is believed that if Tesla can demonstrate that its demand levers and the Inflation Reduction Act contribution can help drive strong growth and margins in the coming quarters, then an upside case could be visible for the stock to trade to about $300.     At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 88 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $7.4 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 73 in the preceding quarter worth $7.2 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In 2014, before we began to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Musk’s electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Tesla’s prospects. That was principally for two reasons:First, automobile manufacturing and distribution is unusually complicated, capital intensive, and highly regulated, which makes profitability problematic;second, cars with ICE motors require extensive annual maintenance, and dealer services revenues, not profits from automobile sales, are the most important contributor to profits of perpetual licensed ICE car dealerships.Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE, not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motors’ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful. (click here to read more…)8. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89     NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 16, NVIDIA made a multi-year partnership with Microsoft to build a supercomputer powered by Microsoft Azure’s advanced supercomputing infrastructure. This would be one of the most powerful cloud-based artificial intelligence supercomputers in the world. NVIDIA chips are considered some of the most advanced across the world and are especially popular among gaming enthusiasts. This niche has helped the company establish a stable foundation which it is now using to expand into new spaces in the tech sector. On December 12, Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay maintained an Outperform rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and raised the price target to $220 from $200, noting that the company is believed to be the leader in accelerated computing, and maintains wide and deep technological moats.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with 19.3 million shares worth more than $2.3 billion.  In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“At the company-specific level, there was a broad correction across the entire portfolio. While four of our holdings contributed to performance, the contribution to absolute returns was less than 100bps combined, as unfortunately none of them was large enough to move the needle. We had 16 investments detracting over 100bps each with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), our second largest detractor, costing the Fund 254bps.NVIDIA’s stock was hit even harder, down 44.4%, impacted by concerns over the health of the consumer, dramatic declines in crypto, and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Despite the sell-off and the increased near-term volatility in its gaming business, NVIDIA’s revenues grew 46% year-over-year with 48% operating margins, driven by continued strength in its data center business as companies across industries adopt AI and ML…(read more)7.

Their products are a key element in driving the digital transformation nearly every large company is undergoing. At the recent JP Morgan investor day, CEO Jamie Dimon explained that while the company could reduce expenses if needed should the economy slow, their spending on digital transformation would continue as this spending was critical to the company managing costs and maximizing revenue over time. As an example of this type of spending, Dimon specifically pointed to ServiceNow, calling out that the company’s products now oversaw the single largest collection of JP Morgan data and highlighted that working with them had saved JP Morgan $50 million over the past few years.

(NYSE:CRM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has become a dominant global player in sales, customer service, commerce and marketing software over the past 20 years. The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. This discount is an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Tech Stocks For Long Term Investment. Suggested Articles:15 Biggest Endowments in the US10 Best BDC Stocks To BuyTop 13 Gas Tanker Shipping Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Linde plc (LIN), BP p.l.c. (BP) and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Linde, the maker of industrial gases, have held up better than the peer group as well as the broader market. The stock is down -5% this year vs. the decline of -8.2% for the Zacks Diversified Chemicals industry and -7.3% decline for the Zacks Basic Materials sector. Driving the stock's momentum is the wide range of applications for its industrial gases, Linde is making the world more productive by the day. The company’s primary products in industrial gases include oxygen, which is used as life support in hospitals. Its process gas, like hydrogen, is being utilized for clean fuels, while its high-purity and specialty gases are employed to manufacture electronics.Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers backed by minimum purchase requirements, thereby securing stable cashflows. The firm reported strong third-quarter results, owing to increased prices and volumes across all end markets, except for healthcare.(You can read the full research report on Linde here &gt;&gt;&gt;)BP shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+28.9% vs. +15.9%). The company has a strong portfolio of upstream projects, backing impressive production growth. BP boasted that the target of adding a net production of 900 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 from key projects was met successfully.It set an aggressive energy transition plan to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy. Although there is no production from its Russia incorporated joint ventures, BP is projecting higher upstream volumes this year. Before reporting its December-quarter results, the energy major is willing to complete an additional $2.5 billion in share buy-backs.However, the leading integrated energy company’s balance sheet is considerably more levered than most peers, limiting its financial flexibility.

The company trimmed its guidance for revenue growth in anticipation of an economic downturn, which might slow down consumer spending. This is a major negative. Further, intensifying market competition and foreign exchange headwinds remain risks.However, PayPal’s third quarter results were driven by strong growth in total payments volume owing to increasing net new active accounts. Strengthening customer engagement was a positive. Strong performance by Venmo contributed well to the TPV growth. The Zacks analyst believe growing transaction revenues are likely to continue driving the top-line growth.Also, solid momentum across peer to peer and PayPal Checkout experiences is a tailwind. Further, PayPal’s growing traction in the United States remains a major positive. Considering the abovementioned facts, the Zacks analyst expect net revenues in 2022 to rise 8.4% from 2021.(You can read the full research report on PayPal here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include BHP Group Limited (BHP), Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

However, it is expected to face threats from the growing demand for live sports streaming such as Fubo TV FUBO, which streamed the FIFA games this year as well.Per NewsOnAir, 12% of the total FIFA viewers streamed the match on OTT platforms. Though the numbers are low as of now, it is expected to grow. Per NewZoo, gaming’s live-streaming audience will hit 1.4 billion by 2025 from the current 921 million.To survive this, Fox will have to enhance its streaming services as cable networks and televisions currently account for 98% of its revenues.Fox Sports to Aid Growth at Fox With Exciting TournamentsThe excitement of the FIFA matches has fueled growth at Fox Sports.

(E3) today released a study that outlines pathways for Illinois to achieve full, economy-wide decarbonization in Illinois by 2050, consistent with the state’s pledge as part of the U.S. Climate Alliance to pursue the Paris Agreement. The study accounts for the significant progress expected as a result of the state’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), which aims to decarbonize the power sector and accelerate transportation electrification, as well as the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).The study found that, while CEJA and the IRA will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Illinois, more action – particularly in the transportation and buildings sectors – will be needed to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Decarbonization refers to the process of lowering GHGs produced by fossil fuel combustion, often through the electrification of transportation, buildings and industry. The study was commissioned by ComEd so the company could better understand the impacts of full decarbonization for the 9 million people it serves and the power grid they depend on for clean, reliable and affordable power.""As the operator of the largest electric grid in Illinois, we have a critical role in enabling the state’s decarbonization goals, and we’re committed to making sure the transition to a clean energy economy is affordable and equitable for all of our customers,"" said Gil C. Quiniones, CEO of ComEd. ""All paths to decarbonization will require the electric grid to do more. This report helps us and our partners in Illinois understand the options for getting to a net-zero future, and the considerations we must make in order to ensure all customers maintain access to safe, reliable and resilient power as we continue to address the impacts of climate change.""Story continuesThe independent report was created with input by a technical advisory committee, including: Argonne National Laboratory’s Center for Climate Resilience and Decision Science, the Environmental Law and Policy Center, the Citizens Utility Board (CUB), the City of Chicago, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the Office of the Attorney General for the State of Illinois, and the Accelerate Group.With the input of the technical advisory committee, E3 conducted an eight-month independent review that builds upon the policies and initiatives set forth in CEJA and the IRA to determine how the state could achieve full decarbonization of the Illinois economy (net-zero emissions) by 2050. The study took into account local considerations, including projected climate and weather changes, as well as Illinois’ colder climate conditions, which will require energy storage and back up to maintain system reliability.Researchers tested three scenarios for transitioning to a net-zero economy:A business-as-usual scenario, which accounts for existing state and federal laws that address energy and transportation sector decarbonization. This scenario will not achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.A moderate electrification scenario, which achieves total decarbonization by 2050 with high levels of electrification but a significant role for fuel backup for heating.A high electrification scenario, which achieves total decarbonization by 2050 with very high levels of electrification and less reliance on hydrogen and gas backup for heating.""This study shows in concrete terms where the opportunities lie for Illinois to reach its long-term climate goals in ways that support customers,"" noted Amber Mahone, a Partner at E3. ""We have evaluated deep decarbonization scenarios in many jurisdictions across North America to help inform the climate and clean energy policies that government, regulators, and utilities are making, and we’re seeing the electric sector make huge amounts of progress. In Illinois, CEJA and the IRA will only accelerate that. There’s a lot of work still to be done to decarbonize vehicles and buildings, to reduce emissions from the agricultural and industrial sectors, and to commercialize critical emerging technologies like low-carbon fuels and the negative emissions technologies that will be needed to get to a carbon neutral future.""Key findings by E3 include:Additional renewables generation above and beyond what is likely to be funded by CEJA and the IRA, will be necessary to ensure enough clean energy is available for meeting the state’s goal of a net-zero economy by 2050. The study also identifies a need for energy storage, building up in the 2040s.The existing grid will need to double in size by 2050 to meet growing electricity demands driven by decarbonization.The costs of decarbonization are expected to be net beneficial, as the additional grid investments would be offset by the avoided costs of fossil fuels, carbon output and climate change; as well as the public health benefits of resulting cleaner air.Due to the disproportionate impact that air pollution and fuel emissions have on disadvantaged and low-income communities, these customers stand to benefit most from decarbonization, and should be prioritized for financial assistance (i.e., incentives/rebates/credits) to help lower the cost of adoption.The study follows recent actions taken by ComEd and partners to better understand what infrastructure improvements will be needed to manage the impacts of climate change and the clean energy transition on customers and the grid. ComEd recently issued a climate adaptation study in partnership with Argonne National Laboratory, which provides insight into climate change and associated weather changes and how they may impact the grid.The full study is available on E3’s website.ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 200 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Oneok Inc. (OKE) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this natural gas company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Oneok is 10.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 11.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 7.6%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Oneok is 78%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 11%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 23.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 6%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Oneok. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Oneok a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Oneok is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Don't Ignore These 2 Oils-Energy Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-140002440.html,1671631202,STORY,"['OKE', 'SLB']","[Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Schlumberger (SLB) earns a Zacks Rank #1 30 days from its next quarterly earnings release on January 20, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.72 a share.Schlumberger's Earnings ESP sits at 4.38%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.72 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.69.SLB is just one of a large group of Oils-Energy stocks with a positive ESP figure. Oneok Inc. (OKE) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Oneok Inc. is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 27, 2023. OKE's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.06 a share 68 days from its next earnings release.For Oneok Inc. the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01 is 4.77%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, SLB and OKE could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

253,795475ab-cbd1-353d-9ee9-93fc4f76ef7a,AKAM,2022-12-22,Five Types of Shoppers You'll Find This Holiday Season (and the Cyberscams They Must Watch Out For),PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/five-types-shoppers-youll-holiday-010000881.html,1671670800,STORY,['AKAM'],"[JAKARTA, Indonesia, Dec. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- With the holidays around the corner, we're smack in the middle of every shopper's favourite season. Big sales days like Singles' Day, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and 12.12 all offer many great opportunities for shoppers to get their fill of good deals.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logoAkamai Technologies, Inc., the cloud company that powers and protects life online, shares five common shopper profiles observed during the year-end shopping period and the cyberscams they should watch out for to help consumers and businesses identify potential blind spots, and learn how to protect themselves this holiday season.""The number of cyber-attacks continues to rise and mutate all the time. In 2022, the most alarming has been the sharp increase in malicious bot attacks, where we recorded a three-fold increase of such attacks. What this means for the retail industry is the likelihood of increased credential stuffing, where attackers use lists of compromised user credentials to breach into a system and data scraping attacks, the process of importing information from a website into a spreadsheet or local file saved on your computer."" said Dean Houari, Director of Security Technology and Strategy, APJ, Akamai.""It is no surprise that attackers are looking to take advantage of the flurry of peak retail activity online during the extended shopping festival season since there's much to gain financially, especially in Asia that accounts for approximately 60 percent of global ecommerce sales. It's essential that both shoppers and retailers work together to learn how to watch out for scams and protect themselves,"" he continued.FIVE TYPES OF YEAR-END SHOPPERS1.     THE PLANNERYou can spot a planner miles away! Planners have their presents wrapped and ready, months before the holidays. Making and planning purchases well ahead of time, Planners often save their credit card information, log ins and other personal information on shopping sites.Story continuesMost likely to fall for: Credential StuffingDuring such attacks, attackers use lists of compromised user credentials to breach into a system via malicious bots, based on the assumption that many users reuse usernames and passwords across multiple services.Tips to protect against credential stuffing:Be wary of saving payment details on merchant websites. While this may be convenient, it can leave data vulnerable if the merchant is breached.Practice good password hygiene, by setting up different passwords for different sites. Better yet – use a password manager to set up unique, difficult-to-guess passwords.2.     THE LAST-MINUTE SCRAMBLERThe opposite of Planners, Last-Minute Shoppers often remember its sale day on 11.11 or 12.12 itself, just before the clock strikes midnight. They snag their deals, but it's always down to the wire for them!Most likely to fall for: PhishingIn their rush, the Last-Minute Shopper is likely to accidentally click on untrustworthy links and fall prey to phishing scams. What appears to be an email from a reputable retailer with a coveted discount may be fraudulent, but the last-minute shopper doesn't have time to check.With the rise of online marketplaces, this is becoming more common. Earlier this year, Singapore's most popular peer-to-peer sales platform was affected when attackers posing as legitimate buyers directed victims to a fake bank website where they would be asked to give their banking details to receive payment. This resulted in at least 72 people losing over $109,000.Tips to protect against phishingVerify the validity of sites before clicking on them or providing any personal information.If emails are unsolicited, be alert to any potential errors. Do not proceed if it includes wrong information, or requests to enable macros, adjust security settings or install applications.3.     The Bargain HunterThe price point is the most significant purchase consideration for these shoppers, who would sift through various sites to get a substantial deal.Most likely to fall for: Social Engineering AttacksBargain hunters would be likely to click on spoofed emails or accept malicious extensions that function as price comparison tools.Attackers prey on buyer's eagerness for a good deal by sending them fake offers that request for their personal data on a page, even impersonating legitimate tools like Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager to compromise code and steal valuable information, impacting shopping sites.Tips to protect against social engineering attacksAlways verify the validity of the offer and the legitimacy of the sender.Use a good spam filter for emails, as a first barrier of defence against suspicious files and links.4.     The Impulse BuyerDriven solely by emotions, impulse shoppers often do not have a specific product in mind before placing an order. They often respond to time pressure to access a coveted item on a limited time offer, at a price too good to refuse.Most likely to fall for: Brand Impersonation AttacksVia fraudulent links, cybercriminals impersonate popular brands, tricking victims into sharing personal information, buying contraband products, visiting a fake website, downloading malware, and more. Exacerbating these trends is social media, where attackers can easily impersonate brands, engage with customers seeking to purchase items, and request for their personal details.Tips to protect against brand impersonationScrutinize links provided in emails and be on high alert if they are not pointing to the correct location or direct to a third-party site not affiliated with the brand.If in doubt, reach out to the brand on their official channels to verify offers before clicking on any links to make payments. Make sure to check that accounts are verified.5.     The ResearcherResearchers extensively compare products and offers before purchasing. They often have various browser extensions installed on their browsers to make quick comparisons.Most likely to fall for: Extension Malware Attacks Cybercriminals hide viruses behind add-ons, which can then install adverts, gather users' browsing history, and seek login credentials by impersonating famous apps and extensions. Malicious extensions could go undetected especially if security software programs treat known extensions as trusted applications.Most recently, attackers have been using information-stealing malware like FB Stealer, which mimics the harmless and standard-looking Chrome extension Google Translate, to prey on users. Financially motivated, attackers after effectively locking a user out of their Facebook account, abuse access to ask the victim's friends for money.Tips to protect against extension malware attacksOnly install extensions from official Web stores.If permissions that extensions require even before installing seem suspicious, it'll be best not to install them.Retailers must do their part too!For a cybersafe shopping experience, retailers have a part to play as well.Attacks on popular retail behemoths in the last few years have revealed important lessons for merchants. Prevention is better than cure. Taking proactive steps to monitor potential threats and being ready to block unauthorised access and keep shoppers safe throughout their retail experience is essential.""As web traffic increases, attackers similarly increase their attacks. Case in point,  malicious bot attacks tripled during Single's Day last year. These attacks could, immediately or in future, drain customer accounts, damage site functionality, and hold encrypted data ransom — all at enormous costs to businesses,"" explained Houari.""To ensure loyalty long term, retailers must make every effort to keep shopper data safe. This could include deploying a bot solution to stop credential stuffing attempts early and using password managers and multi factor authentication to secure users,"" he concluded.About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

Onshore gas compression will provide enough flow from the reservoir to extend plateau production and maintain high gas exports from the facility beyond 2030.Beside this, Equinor will replace the facility’s gas turbine generators with an onshore power connection. This will cut carbon dioxide emissions by 850,000 tons per year, which is equivalent to 2% of Norway’s annual emissions. Notably, the project is a major contributor to the energy transition.Hammerfest is the only large-scale LNG facility in Europe. The Hammerfest facility normally delivers 18.4 million standard cubic meters of gas per day or 6.5 billion cubic meters per year. This corresponds to the energy requirements of 6.5 million Europe homes or 5% of all Norway gas export.Upgrading the Hammerfest LNG facility will improve Norway’s position as a reliable LNG supplier to Europe. Electrification will enable Equinor and partners to deliver the gas with negligible emissions from production. The project is expected to secure long-term operations and gas exports from Melkoya toward 2050.The project is one of the largest single-emission-reduction measures for decarbonizing oil and gas production in Norway.

261,e5719279-9e62-3c89-878e-5f736d0e04c4,ORCL,2022-12-22,Exclusive-TikTok steps up efforts to clinch U.S. security deal,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-tiktok-steps-efforts-clinch-100723369.html,1671703643,STORY,['ORCL'],"[By Echo Wang and David ShepardsonNEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Popular short-video app TikTok is offering to operate more of its business at arm's length and subject it to outside scrutiny as it tries to convince the U.S. government to allow it to remain under the ownership of Chinese technology company ByteDance, according to people familiar with the matter.TikTok has been seeking to assure U.S. government departments and agencies for the last three years that the personal data of U.S. citizens cannot be accessed and its content cannot be manipulated by China's Communist Party or any other entity under the influence of that country's government.Last year, President Joe Biden revoked an executive order by his predecessor Donald Trump to ban TikTok in the United States, but negotiations between his administration and the social media company continued over a potential deal that would address the security concerns.U.S. lawmakers seeking to crack down on China as part of broader set of disputes over trade, intellectual property and human rights have seized on the security concerns over TikTok to pressure the White House to take a hard line.TikTok has already unveiled several measures aimed at appeasing the U.S. government, including an agreement for Oracle Corp to store the data of the app's users in the United States and a United States Data Security (USDS) division to oversee data protection and content moderation decisions. It has spent $1.5 billion on hiring and reorganization costs to build up that unit, according to a source familiar with the matter.But some government officials, including at the U.S. Department of Defense, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency, remain opposed to a security deal, according to the sources. These officials argue that TikTok's users would continue to be vulnerable because the app would still rely for its technology on ByteDance, which also operates Chinese short-video app Douyin.Story continuesTo overcome these hurdles, TikTok has sought to provide new layers of oversight to the U.S. government. It has expanded Oracle's role to ensuring that TikTok's technology infrastructure is separate from ByteDance, the sources said.Oracle will review both app codes, which determine the look and feel of TikTok, and server codes, which provide functions such as search and recommendations, according to the sources. The reviews will occur at dedicated ""transparency centers"" visited by Oracle engineers, with the first one scheduled to open in Maryland in January, one of the sources added.TikTok has also proposed to form a ""proxy"" board that would run the USDS division independent of ByteDance, the sources said. This division is headed on an interim basis by Andrew Bonillo, a former U.S Secret Service agent, and until a security deal with the U.S. is reached it reports to TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew.The USDS board would have three members who would be screened by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a national security panel, the sources said. ByteDance would not have control over the board and its decisions even though it would pay for the USDS division's operations, the sources added.TikTok has been also seeking to hire independent auditors and monitors who would be paid by the company but report to CFIUS, according to the sources. It has sent out requests for proposals for some of the roles to companies and consultants and has set a deadline for responses in the first half of January.The sources requested anonymity to discuss Oracle's expanded role, the proposed proxy board and details of the hiring and spending at TikTok, which are reported here for the first time.A TikTok spokeswoman declined to comment on specific concessions the company has made to the U.S. government but said that the solution to security concerns it put to CFIUS was ""comprehensive."" She added that TikTok has not had any discussions with the U.S. government ""on the substance of the proposed agreement"" since the end of the summer.""We have made substantial progress on implementing that solution over the past year, and look forward to completing that work to put these concerns to rest,"" the TikTok spokeswoman said.Oracle did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the Treasury Department, which chairs CFIUS, declined to comment other than to say the panel was committed to safeguarding national security. The White House declined to comment on the CFIUS review of TikTok.WHITE HOUSE TO DECIDEU.S officials involved in the talks have indicated that many of the voluntary measures TikTok is implementing to bolster its security may be part of any agreement to allow ByteDance to retain its ownership, one of the sources said. However, it is unclear whether Biden's administration will eventually sign off on a security deal with TikTok.The U.S. Treasury Department and the Department of Justice, which have been leading the negotiations with TikTok, have been open to a deal to avoid the kind of legal challenge from the company that bogged down Trump's bid to force a divestment, the sources said.The outcome will ultimately be determined by the White House, the sources added, because Biden will be called upon to adjudicate the arguments of the various government departments and agencies that are either supportive or dismissive of a deal.(Reporting by Echo Wang in New York and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Matthew Lewis)]"

(NASDAQ:MU) announced a raft of job cuts next year and unveiled a reduction to its capital spending plans.Dutch semiconductor firms ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML) and ASM International NV (AS:ASMI) were both in the red in early trading, along with chip-tool manufacturers like BE Semiconductor Industries NV (AS:BESI), Aixtron SE (ETR:AIXGn) and VAT Group AG (SIX:VACN). Germany's Infineon Technologies AG NA O.N. (ETR:IFXGn) and STMicroelectronics NV (EPA:STM) in France were also lower.In a statement included in its fiscal first quarter results, Micron said it would slash about 10% of its headcount, which amounted to 48,000 at the beginning of September.Meanwhile, the forecast for capital expenditure in the 2023 financial year was lowered to between $7-$7.5 billion. Utah-based Micron had previously outlined a spending plan worth $8B, itself down from the $12B level expected for 2022.The firm is also ""significantly"" drawing down its fiscal 2024 capex plans, saying that it expects spending on wafer fabrication equipment - a key signpost of chip demand - to fall year-on-year.Chief executive officer and president Sanjay Mehrotra said the belt-tightening was necessary in response to ""the most severe imbalance between supply and demand"" for its DRAM and NAND memory chips in the last 13 years. Returns from these semiconductors have been hit recently by weaker end-market demand, high inventory levels, and a steep decline in pricing.Mehrotra added that Micron expects chip industry profitability to ""remain challenged"" throughout next year.""The timing of the recovery in profitability will be driven by the rate and pace at which supply and demand are brought into balance and inventories are normalized across the supply chain,"" he said.In the three-month period ended on December 1, Micron's adjusted revenue dropped by 47% annually to $4.09B, missing Bloomberg consensus estimates of $4.13B.Story continuesThe outlook for top-line growth in the second quarter was also weaker than expected at the midpoint.Related ArticlesEuropean chipmakers fall after Micron flags capex reduction, job cutsU.S. SEC heightening scrutiny of auditors' crypto work - WSJIndia stocks lower at close of trade; Nifty 50 down 0.39%]"
271,a1fdebdc-54c6-3a44-b0a5-d0900b928dba,HAS,2022-12-22,Steel Dynamics and Hasbro have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/steel-dynamics-hasbro-highlighted-zacks-133001741.html,1671629401,STORY,"['STLD', 'HAS', 'MANU']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – December 21, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Steel Dynamics STLD as the Bull of the Day and Hasbro HAS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Manchester United plc MANU and Bowlero Corp. BOWL.Here is a synopsis of all four stocks:Bull of the Day:Steel Dynamics is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it sports a A for Value and a B for Growth. This steel producer has been super strong since early October back when the stock was $70. Recently, we have seen a pull back from highs that were above $113.  Let's explore more about this company in this Bull of The Day article.DescriptionBased in Fort Wayne, IN, Steel Dynamics, Inc. is among the leading steel producers and metal recyclers in the United States. It currently has steelmaking and coating capacity of more than 11 million tons. It is one of the most diversified steel companies in the United States with a vast range of specialty products. The company makes and markets steel products, processes and sells recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals, and fabricates and sells steel joist and decking products in the United States and internationally.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market's expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.For STDL, I see four straight beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. That is great to see, but by itself that is not enough to make the company a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The average positive earnings surprise over the course of the last year works out to be 6.2%.Earnings Estimates RevisionsThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher.Story continuesOver the last 60 days, earning estimates have moved up for STLD.This quarter has moved up from $3.34 to $3.78.Next quarter has increased from $3.12 to $3.26.The full fiscal year 2022 has increased from $20.95 to $21.89.Next fiscal year has seen the estimate move from $7.86 to $9.49.Positive movement in earnings helped move this stock to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).ValuationThe valuation for this name is low even with the solid growth  I see a forward PE of 4.6x which is very low, but the company is coming off a quarter that saw topline growth of more than 11%. The price to book multiple is 2.3x. Price to sales comes in at 0.8x while the stock carries operating margins of roughly 20%.Bear of the Day:Hasbro is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) after recently missing earnings. The November retail sales report came in awfully weak so it is not surprising to see analysts taking down estimates of select consumer goods names ahead of the holiday. This article will look at why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as it is the Bear of the Day.DescriptionHasbro, Inc., operates as a play and entertainment company. Its Consumer Products segment engages in the sourcing, marketing, and sale of toy and game products. Its toys and games include action figures, arts and crafts and creative play products, fashion and other dolls, play sets, preschool toys, plush products, sports action blasters and accessories, vehicles and toy-related specialty products. The company's Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment engages in the promotion of its brands through the development of trading card, role-playing, and digital game experiences based on Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast games. Hasbro, Inc. was founded in 1923 and is headquartered in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market's expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.In the case of HAS, it has two beats over the Zacks Consensus Estimate and two misses. This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn't make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.The Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.Earnings EstimatesThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower. For HAS I see annual estimates moving lower of late.The current fiscal year consensus number moved lower from $4.75  to $4.66 over the last 60 days.The next year has moved from $5.37 to $5.14. That move lower is probably the biggest deciding factor for this stock to be a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Negative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).It should be noted that a majority of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions. That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Additional content:2 Entertainment Stocks with Over 35% Gains and More Room to RunMost entertainment stocks gradually overcame the pandemic-induced uncertainties this year. The entertainment industry is riding a wave of tremendous opportunity owing to technological innovations, evolving generational behaviors and pandemic-led behavioral changes. While demand for entertainment content has been resilient during periods of economic uncertainty, the continued impacts of inflation might dampen their performances.With the average U.S. household subscribing to almost five streaming services, it is clear that consumers have to stack these services to access the content they want. To support this trend, streamers have increased their investment in original programming and are passing these costs to the customers. Consequently, the average monthly subscription fees of stack services are approaching the cost of cable. Also, certain companies are focused on integrating gaming and live sports streaming to drive growth.Although there is ongoing friction and fragmentation of streaming services and content, industry players are emphasizing on rationalization of marketing spend and optimization of content slate and distribution approach to deliver a steady state of high-impact releases. This paves a path for efficiency in customer engagement as well as drive subscriber acquisition.We believe that emphasis on unit economics by aggregating the best sports and entertainment content, customer engagement (to drive advertising sales) and offerings of additional content and features (without overshooting costs) are likely to act as key catalysts for growth in the upcoming periods.2 Top Stocks to WatchAlthough economic uncertainty prevails due to inflationary pressures, it would be appropriate for investors to focus on these fundamentally-sound stocks. Investors can keep an eye on the following entertainment stocks that have performed well and are expected to continue the winning streak in the upcoming year.We have shortlisted two entertainment stocks with the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and gaining more than 35% so far this year. These stocks have outperformed their respective industries and the broader Leisure sector so far this year. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Manchester United plcv has shown strong momentum in commercial operations, reflecting both the welcome return of match-going fans to the stadium after the pandemic and the strength of its venue, merchandising and partnership operations. Despite global economic headwinds, the company remains optimistic on account of global TV rights for the Premier League and UEFA competitions.Also, a competitive sponsorship market with many new market entrants looking to build and strengthen their brand through associations acts as a tailwind. In terms of digital activity, the company continues to witness growth in the global reach of the club media content across owned and operated channels and all the major social media platforms. The company expects continued growth backed by its fan engagement initiatives, infrastructure upgrades and maintenance projects.Manchester United currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has gained 49.4% so far this year. For fiscal 2023, the loss estimates have improved 30.8% in the past 60 days, narrowing from a loss of 52 cents per share to a loss of 36 cents.Bowlero Corp. is poised to benefit from pent-up demand, algorithmically powered management system (QMS), center acquisitions and cost control discipline. Since the start of fiscal 2022, the company has added 38 new centers to its portfolio, reflecting a growth of approximately 10% annually.

Its Consumer Products segment engages in the sourcing, marketing, and sale of toy and game products. Its toys and games include action figures, arts and crafts and creative play products, fashion and other dolls, play sets, preschool toys, plush products, sports action blasters and accessories, vehicles and toy-related specialty products. The company's Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment engages in the promotion of its brands through the development of trading card, role-playing, and digital game experiences based on Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast games.  Hasbro, Inc. was founded in 1923 and is headquartered in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number.  This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market.  A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved.  That is what you want to see.In the case of HAS, I two beats of the  Zacks Consensus Estimate and two misses.  This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn’t make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.The Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.Earnings EstimatesThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower.  For HAS I see annual estimates moving lower of late.Story continuesThe current fiscal year consensus number moved lower from $4.75  to $4.66 over the last 60 days.The next year has moved from $5.37 to $5.14.  That move lower is probably the biggest deciding factor for this stock to be a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Negative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).It should be noted that a majority of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions.  That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector lost 4.13%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.49%.McDonald's will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.44, up 9.42% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $5.7 billion, down 5.2% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.92 per share and revenue of $22.93 billion. These totals would mark changes of +6.9% and -1.24%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for McDonald's. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

He downgraded Starbucks this morning, warning of recession risks, but picked McDonald's as a favorite going into the new year. The food and drink space is where we find Sozzi's Take today. Let's start with Mickey D's.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, a lot of information to unpack here from Andy Barish. Really good note here. So Barish is bullish on McDonald's, one of his top picks for next year. So let's tick through this. First, same store sales really did well in the 2008, 2009 recession. That is part of Barish's call here that a company like McDonald's-- there I am with my McDonald's hat on-- they're very, very cool-- will do well in a recession as consumers trade down.Now he's also saying that same store sales really did well coming out of the 2008, 2009 recession. So that is a good. Perhaps if we enter a recession in the middle of next year and we come out of it in the latter part, that might benefit McDonald's, at least according to how the 2008, 2009 recession handed down. And as I just mentioned, people trade down historically to McDonald's in tough economic times.Why? Because the food is still relatively cheap despite inflation. And here, you can see that chart from Barish here going back showing those sales outperforming, relatively speaking. The broader restaurant industry during that period of the 2008, 2009 recession. McDonald's doing pretty well during the recession and coming out of the recession.Barish saying that through 2024, he thinks McDonald's brand relevancy led by valuing convenience to support same store sales and profitability outperformance versus peers. McDonald's looking pretty good in a potential US recession next year.BRAD SMITH: OK, and so where is Barish bearish?Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: Bearish. Well, he's not too keen on Starbucks putting out a lengthy, I would say, downgrade report on Starbucks. Really the opposite of the play on McDonald's here that a recession could impact Starbucks in a big way as consumers trade down from that brand. Perhaps maybe they go over to a Dunkin' brands or if they just make their own coffee at home. And then--JULIE HYMAN: What?BRIAN SOZZI: Right, I know. Right? Go figure, people making their own coffee at home instead of spending 12 bucks on Starbucks. But also noting that the shares are a little bit pricey from a valuation level right now. Thinks recession will hurt the company's sales. Also another analyst noting that or just thinking that Starbucks set its expectations for its financials too high at its recent investor day.Now on the positive side, China reopening should benefit a company like Starbucks. It didn't really benefit a company like Nike in the most recent quarter, but still might benefit from Starbucks next year. My take here, to tie this all in a bow, in a recession, cheap burgers ultimately win, $8 coffees do not. And I think that fits or just jives very well in what we've seen in past periods of recession. Consumers just cut these things out and look for cheaper alternatives.JULIE HYMAN: Hm.BRAD SMITH: All right, little luxuries in one way or another, perhaps. Value versus luxury.]"
279,a2f0db98-03ef-3e2a-9125-6270a2d0e5b3,MCD,2022-12-22,McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski hit with racial discrimination lawsuit after firing security chief who says he criticized him in town hall meeting,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonald-ceo-chris-kempczinski-hit-125011387.html,1671627011,STORY,['MCD'],"[A former security chief for McDonald’s is filing a racial discrimination lawsuit against the company and CEO Chris Kempczinski, claiming he was fired for speaking out in a meeting.Michael Peaster was the vice president of global safety, security, and intelligence until 2021 when he was fired after 35 years at the company. McDonald’s claims this was down to performance issues, but Peaster says that it was part of an effort to oust him after he dared to criticize Kempczinski in a Town Hall meeting.Peaster, who is Black, had spoken out in the meeting, which was called to discuss a text sent by the CEO to the Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot reflecting on two fatal shootings.The text read: ""p.s. tragic shootings last week, both at our restaurant yesterday and with Adam Toldeo. With both, the parents failed those kids which I know is something you can't say. Even harder to fix.""When the words were made public it drew mass outcry and Kempczinski was accused of racism and victim-blaming. He later responded to the backlash by saying that his message “lacked the empathy and compassion” he really felt for the families who lost their loved ones.According to the suit, Peaster said in the Town Hall meeting: “We cannot broad brush the violence issues in Chicago to make it appear that all parents who have children who are victims to gun violence are bad parents. We have to have empathy and compassion for the majority of families who live in tough communities that work hard to provide for their family and keep them safe.""Peaster's words were followed by applause, according to the suit.Barred from company jetPeaster, who was responsible for Kempczinski’s personal security, claims that from that point onwards he was discriminated against and undermined—all the way up to his dismissal. According to the suit, the CEO stopped him from flying on the company’s private jet, and Peaster was told he had made Kempczinksi “feel unsafe” during a trip to Mexico City and São Paulo.Story continuesMcDonalds maintains that the timeline is incorrect and that the allegations are false. In a statement, the company added: ""Mr. Peaster was promoted in January 2022; however, he was subsequently terminated due to serious performance issues in his expanded role. To suggest that his termination was based on retaliation or anything other than performance lapses is to completely ignore the facts. We intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit and to continue to lead with our values.""This isn’t the first time McDonalds has faced similar allegations. Two black executives filed a discrimination lawsuit in January 2020 and said they’d suffered emotional distress, humiliation and physical suffering. In September 2020, 52 black former franchisees sought $1 billion in an anti-discrimination lawsuit which was dismissed by a judge, but later amended and refiled.McDonald's is also being sued by media mogul Byron Allen for $10 billion after he claimed the company purposefully cut out African-American owned businesses in their advertising campaigns.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: People who skipped their COVID vaccine are at higher risk of traffic incidentsElon Musk says getting booed by Dave Chapelle fans 'was a first for me in real life' suggesting he's aware of building backlashGen Z and young millennials have found a new way to afford luxury handbags and watches—living with mom and dadMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand]"

Buyers' inclination toward green cars is serving as a key catalyst. The popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) is soaring with each passing day and auto biggies are fast cementing their position in this domain.While supply chain chaos is still there, production challenges are ebbing and inventory levels are visibly improving. Meanwhile, the most pressing concern now is high borrowing costs, which are making it difficult for less-affluent and subprime consumers to find affordable vehicle payments to suit their monthly budgets.Nevertheless, the overall prospects of the industry look decent. We recommend placing your bets on two top-ranked industry participants, PACCAR and Harley-Davidson, to fetch handsome gains.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles.The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through. The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in the fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.Key Investing ThemesRobust EV Sales: Climate change concerns, technological advancement and stringent fuel-emission standards are increasing green vehicles' adoption by both automakers as well as customers. The demand for electric cars is off the charts and EV sales continue to break records.Story continuesThe year 2022 has been the biggest year for zero-emission vehicles in the United States on record. In the third quarter of 2022, U.S. EV sales continued to outpace their ICE counterparts, hitting a new record of over 200,000 units of battery-powered vehicles.Legacy automakers are going the extra mile to gain a strong foothold in this red-hot e-mobility space.The latest Inflation Reduction Act will fuel EV sales further. The EV momentum is only expected to blossom going forward.Inventory Levels Improving: With challenges associated with new-vehicle production starting to abate, we are seeing noticeable improvements in the inventory levels. Strong production levels are likely to translate to higher days' supply and offer shoppers more vehicle options, going forward. Total US automotive inventory increased to about 1.55 million units at the end of October, up from 1.43 million units in September and the highest level since May 2021. Rising inventory and pent-up consumer demand will aid sales.Vehicle Affordability Is the New Concern: Just when new vehicles seem to be becoming more widely available, it's to be seen if Americans wish to continue to splurge on these high-ticket items in the face of rising interest rates. To purchase the same vehicle at the same monthly payment, buyers are now forced to increase their down payment, which is resulting in new affordability challenges. With borrowing getting expensive and risks of a potential slowdown in the economy, consumers might be unwilling to pay a heavy premium for cars.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry is a 20-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #75, which places it in the top 30% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group's earnings growth potential.Before we present you three industry participants worth considering for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Domestic Auto industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the sector over the past year. The industry has lost 53.1% compared with the S&amp;P 500 and sector's decline of 18.7% and 47.6%, respectively, over the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 16.46X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 11.64X and the sector's 12.21X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 54.42X, as low as 8.85X and at a median of 15.30X.2 Stocks to BuyPACCAR: Headquartered in Bellevue, PACCAR is one of the leading names in the trucking business with reputed brands like Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. The new DAF lineup comprising XF and XG models (launched in 2021) and the XD model (launched in 2022) is driving the firm's revenues. Continued growth in the aftermarket parts — which is a high margin and a less cyclic business, thanks to the rampant adoption of its proprietary MX engine — bodes well. Accelerated efforts toward electrification, connected vehicle services and advanced driver-assistance system options are set to bolster PACCAR's prospects. A solid balance sheet with low leverage is another tailwind.PACCAR currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PACCAR's 2022 and 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 53.4% and 4.3%, respectively. The consensus mark for PACCAR's 2022 and 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 23.4% and 5%, respectively. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on all occasions, the average surprise being 12.6%.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Harley-Davidson: Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson is one of the leading motorcycle makers in the world. In sync with long-term growth objectives to streamline its product portfolio, HOG is focusing on motorcycle models and technologies that better align with market trends. Its Hardwire plans look to improve effectiveness and contribute to revenue growth. Per the plan, the company remains focused on bolstering its market position by emphasizing on sportier bikes and a modern marketing strategy. Building on Hardwire strategy, the company announced Hardwire Stage II in May, aiming for increased performance.Harley-Davidson currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HOG's 2022 and 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 12.4% and 1%, respectively. The consensus mark for HOG's 2022 and 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 7.5% and 3%, respectively. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on three occasions and missed once, the average surprise being 43.2%.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investing and returns of dividend stocks in the past, and go directly to read Dividend Champions List Ranked By Yield: Top 10. Analysts recommend loading up on dividend stocks because they are an important source of return and can help investors survive market volatility smoothly. According to a report by Allspring Global, even dividend companies with lower dividend growth rates delivered dividend growth higher than the rate of inflation in the past 30 years.Dividend stocks have exhibited strong performance relative to the broader market during previous inflationary periods.

(NASDAQ:NTAP) stock drops to US$59.47",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-purchased-lose-us-63k-143123414.html,1671633083,STORY,['NTAP'],"[Insiders who bought US$360k worth of NetApp, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:NTAP) stock at an average buy price of US$72.04 over the last year may be disappointed by the recent 7.6% decrease in the stock. Insiders buy with the expectation to see their investments rise in value over a period of time. However, recent losses have rendered their above investment worth US$297k which is not ideal.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for NetApp The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At NetAppOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Executive VP &amp; CFO Michael Berry for US$360k worth of shares, at about US$72.04 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$59.47 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. Michael Berry was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At NetApp Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of NetApp shares. In total, Independent Director Carrie Palin dumped US$174k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes NetApp Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that NetApp insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$40m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About NetApp Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. In contrast, they appear keener if you look at the last twelve months. And insiders do own shares. So the recent selling doesn't worry us too much. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for NetApp (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

292,a75a6b26-dde8-3fff-82c9-b2c628963a0e,NI,2022-12-22,Slowing Rates Of Return At NiSource (NYSE:NI) Leave Little Room For Excitement,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/slowing-rates-return-nisource-nyse-101616594.html,1671704176,STORY,['NIMC'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at NiSource (NYSE:NI) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for NiSource, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.051 = US$1.1b ÷ (US$26b - US$3.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, NiSource has an ROCE of 5.1%.  On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 4.7%. See our latest analysis for NiSource roceIn the above chart we have measured NiSource's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From NiSource's ROCE Trend?The returns on capital haven't changed much for NiSource in recent years. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 5.1% and the business has deployed 30% more capital into its operations. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.What We Can Learn From NiSource's ROCELong story short, while NiSource has been reinvesting its capital, the returns that it's generating haven't increased. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 27% to shareholders over the last five years. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.Story continuesOne more thing: We've identified   3 warning signs  with NiSource (at least 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  , and understanding them would certainly be useful.While NiSource isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

293,c09bb281-e5b1-3178-93bd-10a3cb5a65ce,NI,2022-12-22,Bet on 5 Top Stocks With Rising P/E,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bet-5-top-stocks-rising-143902802.html,1671633542,STORY,"['DOCU', 'ROOT', 'NI', '^GSPC', 'DAVA', 'NIMC']","[Investors always look for stocks with low P/E ratios as the measure indicates undervaluation. This ratio is obtained by dividing a stock’s current market price by its historical or estimated earnings. It tells how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings.In fact, the golden rule is – the lower the P/E of a stock, the higher its value will be for investors. This is because value investors believe that a stock's current market price is not reflective of its historical/future earnings and, therefore, chances of outperformance are higher.But there is another side to the story that points to stocks with an increasing P/E. But this often-overlooked trend can prove pivotal in finding great stocks. The screener yields stocks including Clovis Oncology CLVS, NiSource NI, DocuSign DOCU, Root ROOT and Endava DAVA.How Can Rising P/E Be Helpful?Investors should note that stock prices move in tandem with earnings performance. If earnings come in stronger, the price of a stock soars. Solid quarterly earnings and guidance in turn boost the earnings forecast, leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price.So, if the price is rising steadily, it means that investors are assured of the stock’s fundamental strength, expect some strong positives out of it as well as solid and faster earnings growth. Moreover, studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P/E ratios jump over 100% from their breakout point in the cycle. So, if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle, you can end up seeing considerable gains.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P/E, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year’s actual growthPercentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal zero(These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years).Story continuesPercentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeksPercentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks(These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes).Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S&amp;P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&amp;P 500Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&amp;P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S&amp;P 500(Here, the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S&amp;P 500).Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20% higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks, but it should not exceed 100%(A 20% increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend. But a jump of over 100% indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal).In addition, we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 27.Here are five out of the 27 stocks:Clovis Oncology (CLVS): Clovis Oncology, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing innovative anti-cancer agents. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2.The average earnings surprise of CLVS for the past four quarters is 5.19%.NiSource (NI): This Zacks Rank #2 energy holding company, together with its subsidiaries, provides natural gas, electricity and other products and services in the United States.The average earnings surprise of NI for the past four quarters is 0.33%.DocuSign (DOCU): Zacks Rank #2 DocuSign is a global provider of cloud-based software. The company’s DocuSign Agreement Cloud is a cloud software suite that automates and connects the entire agreement process.The average earnings surprise of DOCU for the past four quarters is 6.60%.Root (ROOT): This is the parent company of Root Insurance Company. It is a technology company revolutionizing personal insurance with a pricing model. ROOT currently carries a Zacks Rank #1.The average earnings surprise of ROOT for the past four quarters is 22.44%.Endava (DAVA): The Zacks Rank #2 company provides information technology services.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) insiders sold US$4.9m worth of stock, possibly signalling a downtrend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mondelez-international-inc-nasdaq-mdlz-120105096.html,1671710465,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Over the past year, many Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Mondelez International Mondelez International Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Robin Hargrove, for US$2.0m worth of shares, at about US$65.86 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$66.89). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 49% of Robin Hargrove's holding.Insiders in Mondelez International didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Mondelez International better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Mondelez International Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Mondelez International shares. Specifically, Executive VP and President of Asia Pacific Maurizio Brusadelli ditched US$1.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Mondelez International insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$107m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Mondelez International Tell Us?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Mondelez International (1 shouldn't be ignored) you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Geopolitical issues, stubborn COVID-19 uncertainties, and a hawkish pivot from the Federal Reserve have all been thorns in the market’s side year-to-date.However, believe it or not, there have been plenty of stocks in 2022 snapping the overall bearish trend.Three of the top S&amp;P 500 performers in 2022 – Occidental Petroleum OXY, Cardinal Health CAH, and Hess Corp. HES – have all delivered substantial gains to investors.The chart below illustrates the year-to-date performance of all three stocks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we can see, all three stocks have gone on a stellar run in 2022. Let’s take a closer look at each one.Occidental Petroleum Occidental Petroleum is an integrated oil and gas company with significant exploration and production exposure.Like many stocks in the Zacks Oils and Energy sector, OXY’s growth trajectory is impossible to ignore; the company’s earnings are forecasted to soar nearly 280% year-over-year in its current fiscal year (FY22) paired with revenue growth of 42%. Still, the growth is projected to cool off in FY23, with estimates calling for a 23% year-over-year drop in earnings and a 9.6% pullback in revenue. This is shown in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the company generates solid cash; OXY reported free cash flow of $3.6 billion in its latest quarter, enough for a sizable 36% Y/Y increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCardinal Health Inc. Cardinal Health is a nationwide drug distributor and provider of services to pharmacies, healthcare providers, and manufacturers.Analysts have raised their earnings outlook for CAH’s current and next fiscal year as of late, helping land the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUndoubtedly a major positive, Cardinal Health belongs to the elite Dividend Aristocrat group; Dividend Aristocrats are classified as companies with at least 25 consecutive annual dividend increases.Story continuesCAH’s annual dividend currently yields roughly 2.5%, above its Zacks Medical sector by a fair margin.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHess Corp. Hess is a globally integrated energy company engaging in the exploration, production, development, transportation, purchase, and sale of crude oil and natural gas liquids.Hess has been on a strong earnings streak, exceeding earnings and revenue estimates in four consecutive quarters.

298,3f0e616f-0269-3761-873a-9fe37dfece92,BSX,2022-12-22,Here's Why You Should Retain Boston Scientific (BSX) For Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-boston-scientific-164004906.html,1671640804,STORY,"['BSX', 'SWAV']","[Boston Scientific Corporation BSX is gaining from new strategic investments. The robust performance of the WATCHMAN device instills optimism. However, unfavorable currency movements and stiff competition raise apprehension.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 8.7% against45.2% fall of the industry.The renowned manufacturer of medical devices and products has a market capitalization of $65.65 billion. The company’s long-term projected growth of 10.3% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 13%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayImpressive Q3 Results: Boston Scientific ended the third quarter of 2022 with revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Third-quarter 2022 total operational sales grew 14% and organic sales grew 11.5% year over year, exceeding the high end of the company’s guidance of 8-10%. The majority of the company’s business units rose double-digits organically and nearly all of the businesses and regions grew faster than their respective markets.New Strategic Investments to Drive Electrophysiology: Investors are optimistic about Boston Scientific’s acquisition of Farapulse -- a leader in pulsed field ablation, an emerging field that has the potential to improve safety, efficacy, and ease of use for cardiac ablation procedures. This acquisition complements Boston Scientific’s electrophysiology portfolio to include the FARAPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) System. In its fourth-quarter earnings call, the company noted that the early Farapulse launch has been progressing in Europe, as physicians remain enthusiastic about this technology’s safety and ease of use.WATCHMAN, a Long-Term Growth Component: Boston Scientific’s structural heart programs are fast building momentum, banking on the strong performance of the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. In this regard, WATCHMAN recently received reimbursement in Japan. Also, the next generation WATCHMAN FLX is strongly capturing the European market.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the third quarter, Boston Scientific noted that WATCHMAN’s organic sales rose 26% year over year. Global growth remained strong supported by the FDA approval of an expanded label to include dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). This gave physicians and patients choice of DAPT or Oral anticoagulation (OAC) in the first 45 days post-implant. In terms of innovation, Boston Scientific is optimistic about Trusteer, the new steerable sheath and the next-generation FLX device, WATCHMAN FLX PRO.DownsidesForex Woes: With Boston Scientific recording 47% of its sales from the international market, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. Unfavorable currency movements have been a major dampener over the last few quarters, as in the case of other important MedTech players too.Competitive Landscape: The presence of many players has made the medical devices market highly competitive. Boston Scientific participates in several markets, including Cardiovascular, CRM, Endosurgery and Neuromodulation, where it faces competition from large, well-capitalized companies and several other smaller companies.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boston Scientific’s 2022 earnings is pegged at $1.73, indicating a 6.1% increase from the 2021 reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $12.68 billion, suggesting a 6.6% rise from the 2021 figure.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that investors can consider are ShockWave Medical, Inc. SWAV, Orthofix Medical Inc. OFIX and Merit Medical System MMSI.ShockWave Medical, sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 33.1% for 2023. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 180.1%.ShockWave Medical has outperformed its industry in the past year. SWAV has gained 35% against the industry’s 32.6% fall in the past year.Orthofix Medical currently carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted EPS of 13 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a stupendous 550%. Revenues of $114 million outpaced the consensus mark by 2.7%.Orthofix Medical has an estimated next-year growth rate of 58.97%.

If you want to read about some more retail stocks, go directly to 5 Best Retail Stocks to Buy Now.As per Retail Global Market Report 2022, the global retail market was valued at roughly $23.65 trillion in 2021. The market is expected to reach a valuation of $26.33 trillion by the end of 2022 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.3%. The market size is forecasted to be worth approximately $38.71 trillion by 2026 at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1%. This growth is attributed to the use of data analytics in management by retailers to enhance supply chain efficiency, streamline operations to engage customers, and build loyalty.Despite the large size of the market itself, some of the leading retail stocks have struggled this year due to an unsteady economic climate brought on by rampant inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain disruptions, and rising inventories. Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has raised the benchmark interest rates five times in response to growing inflation. Currently, inflation is at 40-year highs. The consumer price index (CPI) for October 2022 climbed 7.7% over the previous year, according to a report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on November 10.However, analysts remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of the retail sector and foresee a rebound in the strongest retail stocks during the holiday season.

Online and non-store sales are projected to rise by 10-12% to meet the target of $263 billion over the holidays. The organization estimates that each American will spend about $832 on gifts, food, and decorations this year.Therefore, to keep up with the rise in demand during the holidays, retailers have positioned themselves in line with the anticipated shift in customer behavior.

The contract will serve the U.S. Navy and FMS customers.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Story continuesPer a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during the 2022-2028 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.3%.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Recent times have been advantageous for Coca-Cola as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Coca-Cola will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Is There Enough Growth For Coca-Cola?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Coca-Cola's to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 12% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen a 26% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been respectable for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 7.5% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.1% growth per annum, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.With this information, we find it interesting that Coca-Cola is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Final WordUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Our examination of Coca-Cola's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.Before you take the next step, you should know about the 2 warning signs for Coca-Cola that we have uncovered.You might be able to find a better investment than Coca-Cola.

Speculating on capital gains is inevitable as a financial market participant; however, maximizing your portfolio's total return prospects makes life easier and returns more stable and predictable.Furthermore, financial literature has proven that dividend stocks tend to outperform most market segments whenever the macroeconomic climate is uncertain. Many analysts are predicting that a 2023 recession is likely, which prompted me to take a closer look at the market with a focus on dividends to bulk up total return potential. Following my research, here are three of my favorite dividend stocks that demonstrate solid yields and dividend consistency.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with INTC. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioNYSE:KO) is considered a Dividend King. Investing in quality dividend stocks isn't just about scouting for yield, it's also about consistent dividend growth, and in this respect, few can match the maker of Coke.Coca-Cola's 2.81% dividend yield is accommodated by an interest coverage ratio of 16.47, suggesting the stock has plenty of leeway to continue paying dividends on top of the interest on its debt.Many might be concerned about the stock's elevated price-earnings ratio, which is currently at 27.42. However, I'm from the school of thought that believes higher price multiples for low-beta assets are justified. In addition, Coca-Cola's five-year net income compound annual growth rate of 16.88% phases out much of the stock's valuation risk.3 Dividend Stocks to Maximize Total Return PotentialIn recent news, Coca-Cola beat its third-quarter earnings target by $0.05 per share. Additionally, the company's top line surged by 11% year over year, beating analysts' expectations by $600 million.Much of Coca-Cola's recent growth remains related to its staple fizzy drink products. However, the company's pivot into newer generation products is apparent with the recent acquisitions of Innocent, Ades and BodyArmor. Coca-Cola's Costa takeover added hot drinks to its portfolio with critical geographic exposure in the United Kingdom.Coca-Cola is considered a core holding by many investors. Its beta coefficient of 0.57x means it's 1.75 times less risky than the S&amp;P 500. Yet, the stock's total returns have eclipsed the S&amp;P 500's over the last five years.Realty Income CorpRealty Income Corp. (NYSE:O) provides an exceptionally attractive compounding opportunity in my view with its incredible monthly dividend distributions. The company is structured as a real estate investment trust (REIT) which derives its income from a portfolio of approximately 7,000 rental properties. The annual dividend yield currently sits at 4.71% with an interest coverage ratio of 2.85.Investors need to be careful with REITs whenever recession risk is elevated. However, Realty Income's dividend yield of 4.59% and its 0.79 beta coefficient mean it could survive severe cyclical drawdowns.The REIT released its third-quarter earnings report last month, revealing an earnings per share beat of $0.02 per share and a revenue beat of $15.67 million. Moreover, the REIT's long-term trajectory remains firm, with its adjusted funds from operations growing at a compound annual growth rate of 5.1% since 1995.A key value addition to the REIT's business model is its ""key anchor"" strategy. The strategy includes hosting large brands as tenants, allowing it to lure in smaller leasees at premiums.The REIT's valuation metrics might concern many as its price-to-funds-from-operations ratio of 17.53 is worse than 67.74% of its peers. However, as previously mentioned, low-beta assets that are considered best-in-class tend to exhibit higher price multiples.3 Dividend Stocks to Maximize Total Return PotentialIntel CorpIntel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) has two primary advantages as a dividend income play Firstly, its business is conducive to today's consumer environment, especially with the semiconductor industry in the U.S. benefitting from the government's deglobalization efforts. And secondly, the stock hosts a magnificent dividend profile with a forward dividend yield of 5.53%, secured by an interest coverage ratio of 16.68.3 Dividend Stocks to Maximize Total Return PotentialIntel is considered one of the key players in the semiconductor industry. Even though it has fallen from the top of innovation in recent years, the company still holds 63.5% of the CPU market, which has allowed it to achieve economies of scale, conveyed by its gross profit margin of 46.56%. The knock-on effect of Intel's low-cost business model will enable it to leverage key relationships with corporate buyers, adding to revenue consistency.3 Dividend Stocks to Maximize Total Return PotentialSource: StatistaWith a price-earnings ratio of merely 8.14, Intel provides a rare value opportunity in the technology sector in my view. Technology stocks' price multiples are typically high, yet Intel's valuation metrics remain suppressed due to the business troubles it has been experiencing, resulting in a more attractive valuation than 76.59% of its peers.Lastly, the relative strength index indicates that Intel stock has fallen into a momentum pattern during the past two weeks, suggesting the market believes the stock is oversold.3 Dividend Stocks to Maximize Total Return PotentialConcluding thoughtsI believe dividend stocks could outperform from a total return perspective in the near-term as investors pivot strategies in 2023. The likes of Coca-Cola, Realty Income and Intel could thus provide diversified options with robust dividend portfolios and the potential for eventual capital gains once the recession ends.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"
311,0daa11af-6b5c-37a6-8bd6-ace75a086063,KO,2022-12-22,CocaCola Company The (KO) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cocacola-company-ko-trending-stock-140002186.html,1671631202,STORY,['KO'],"[Coca-Cola (KO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned +0.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.5% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coke belongs, has gained 1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.48 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.53 indicates a change of +1.9% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Coke is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Coke, the consensus sales estimate of $9.95 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.1%. The $42.8 billion and $43.69 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.7% and +2.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $11.06 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.2%. EPS of $0.69 for the same period compares with $0.65 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.37%. The EPS surprise was +7.81%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

One of those areas is among the hottest healthcare stocks.With company-specific catalysts outweighing negative macro factors such as high inflation, rising interest rates, and slowing economic growth, scores of healthcare stocks have delivered strong returns in 2022. However, far from a “one and done” phenomenon, it’s not too late to dive in if you’ve yet to add these plays to your portfolio.Although the market has caught on to the opportunity with these biotech, pharmaceutical, and medical device product stocks, several of them continue to have a material runway.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat’s the case here with these seven hottest healthcare stocks. As their respective catalysts (namely new treatments/products) continue to play out, each one has a strong chance of making another significant move higher in 2023 and in the years ahead. Consider now an ideal time to initiate or add to a position.TickerCompanyPriceBIIBBiogen$284.98BNTXBioNTech$175.25INCYIncyte$82.03INSPInspire Medical Systems$253.66LLYEli Lilly$359.87VEEVVeeva Systems$168.26VTRSViatris$10.96Biogen (BIIB)BIIB stock: Biogen Factory Building in: Luterbach Solothurn SwitzerlandSource: PictureDesignSwiss / Shutterstock.comTrending lower for most of 2022, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) ripped higher on Sep. 28, on the heels of game-changing news regarding one of the key drug candidates in its pipeline, Alzheimer’s treatment Lecanemab.Trial data released on that date indicated that Lecanemab, which the company is developing with Japan-based pharmaceutical company Eisai (OTCMKTS:ESALY), helped to slow down the progress of the disease among early-stage patients. While it may seem as if the potential upside from Lecanemab is already priced-into BIIB stock, that’s not necessarily the case.Story continuesFor one, while the stock has moved higher, its valuation hasn’t exactly gotten out of hand. Its shares today trade for 16.6 times forward earnings. More importantly, if this drug makes it to market, based on forecasts from analysts at JP Morgan (calling for as much as $10 billion in peak annual sales), commercialization could further boost both BIIB’s earnings and its stock price.BioNTech (BNTX)The headquarters of BioNTech (BNTX) in Germany.Source: Palatinate Stock / Shutterstock.comThe mass wave of Covid-19 vaccination may have long since passed, but that doesn’t mean BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) has ceased to be one of the hottest healthcare stocks. Shares in this German-based biotech company, which co-developed widely-used Covid-19 vaccine Comirnaty with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), have fallen around 20.5% since January.However, even as the vaccination bonanza is coming to an end, this may be more than reflected in the valuation of BNTX stock. Shares sell for only five times estimated 2022 earnings and just 10.2 times 2023 earnings forecasts, which already take into account a massive drop off in Covid-19 vaccine sales.That’s not all. Besides being a good value, BNTX has emerging growth catalysts in play as well. With a pipeline filled with promising mRNA-based vaccine candidates covering a wide variety of ailments, including malaria and tuberculosis, success with a few of them may be enough to spark a comeback.Incyte (INCY)incy stockSource: Eyesonmilan / Shutterstock.comA developer of therapeutics, Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) is an established biotech company generating billions in annual revenue. Jakafi, a treatment for myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, is now Incyte’s flagship product. Last quarter, Jakafi’s net product and royalty revenues made up around 85.7% of overall sales.That said, Jakafi may not make up the lion’s share of INCY’s top line for long. As a Seeking Alpha commentator argued last month, one of Incyte’s other treatments at the commercialization stage, Opzelura (a non-segmental vitiligo treatment), is poised to experience a massive jump in revenue. Sales doubled last quarter and could keep taking off in the coming quarters.Furthermore, the company continues to make big progress with several promising treatments in its pipeline. Broadening its product pipeline and earnings growth, making its current forward earnings multiple (around 30) reasonable. There’s plenty of room for INCY stock to keep climbing.Inspire Medical Systems (INSP)Modern Medical Research Laboratory with Computer, Microscope, Glassware with Biochemicals on the Desk. Scientific Lab Biotechnology Development Center Full of High-Tech Equipment. Biomedical technology stocksSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comBased in Golden Valley, Minnesota, Inspire Medical Systems (NYSE:INSP) makes medical devices used to treat obstructive sleep apnea. Its namesake product, Inspire, is an implantable nerve stimulator. This is an alternative treatment to the traditional continuous positive airway pressure (or CPAP) therapies that are commonly used to treat this disorder.With the commercialization of its technology, INSP’s revenue has increased well over tenfold over the past five years. On Dec 13, KeyBanc’s Matthew Mishan gave INSP stock the equivalent of a “buy” rating and a $287 per share price target. Per the analyst, Inspire is “well-positioned to meet or exceed revenue growth expectations.”With its high operating leverage, further revenue growth may result in a big improvement in Inspire’s bottom line. Current losses could swing to high earnings down the road. This will likely enable INSP, currently sporting a $7.4 billion market cap, to sustain, then grow, its current valuation.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) has been one of the hottest healthcare stocks of 2022. Yet despite its big year-to-date run-up, don’t assume shares will soon lose their current “hot stock” status. Why?As I argued earlier this month, the potential with Mounjaro, the company’s main drug candidate, is more than enough to send LLY stock even higher from here. Mounjaro initially developed as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes, is now in the running to become approved for use as a treatment for obesity.If Eli Lilly obtains regulatory approval to market Mounjaro for this use, it could translate into impressive levels of revenue/earnings growth for this large, established pharmaceutical company. According to analysts at UBS, peak annual sales for Mounjaro could top $25 billion. Given that a mere $1 billion in annual sales makes a drug a “blockbuster,” this drug could ultimately become a “blockbuster among blockbusters.”Veeva Systems (VEEV)veev stockSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAfter looking at biotech, medical device, and pharma plays, let’s look at a healthcare technology stock that’s among the hottest in the sector. Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) is a provider of cloud-based software to the life sciences industry.Sure, with the VEEV stock dropping 33.75% this year, amid the market sell-off that in particular knocked SaaS stocks like this one significantly lower, you may be doubting that it still holds “hot stock” status. However, VEEV differs from many SaaS stocks. Namely, while many other similarly-sized SaaS companies remain unprofitable, Veeva is already consistently-profitable.Since it is operating in a sector more likely to stay resilient during an economic downturn, revenue and earnings growth could carry on in the years ahead. Analyst forecasts call for earnings of $5.33 per share by FY 2025 (fiscal year ending January 2025). That’s more than double the reported earnings from the preceding fiscal year.Viatris (VTRS)Viatris (VTRS) website page. Viatris.com logo on display screenSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.comViatris (NASDAQ:VTRS) was formed in late 2020 when Pfizer merged its former Upjohn unit into Mylan N.V. Since that Reverse Morris Trust merger transaction, shares in this pharmaceutical company have struggled. Despite a low valuation, with high debt and low growth, investors have largely shied away from it until recently.As Louis Navellier discussed late last month, a pair of pending transactions point to brighter prospects ahead, shifting sentiment for VTRS stock. The forthcoming purchases of Oyster Point Pharma (NASDAQ:OYST) and Famy Life Sciences could enable the company to wring out revenue and cost synergies.Trading for just 3.3 times forward earnings, even if these acquisitions translate into modest operating improvements and a modest re-rating, it could still result in a big move higher ahead for VTRS. In the meantime, you can generate steady returns from the stock via its 4.31% dividend.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayEarly Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air”It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Recycling Stocks To Buy Now. The global waste recycling services market was valued at $57.69 billion in 2021 and is expected to be worth $88.01 billion by 2030, indicating a compound annual growth rate of 4.8% during the forecast period of 2022 to 2030. The high volume of global economic activities has heightened the demand for recycling of waste materials. The recycling sector has become an integral part of the urban infrastructure since it ensures the protection of both the human health and environment. In addition to higher urbanization and the expanding industrial sector, the growing agricultural production leads to more wastage from the agro-industries, thus driving the demand for the waste recycling services across the globe. There are new entrants looking to resolve the lags in the waste management and recycling industry. For example, solar panels are considered green hardware, but older versions of panels are turning into hazardous waste. Thus, a California-based startup, SolarCycle, is using that waste by recycling parts of the older panels and disposing them off for profit. SolarCycle asserts that it can cheaply extract about 95% of the important materials in solar panels, like silver, silicon, copper, and aluminum. These can then be recycled or repurposed, resulting in an efficient circular solar economy.Some of the best recycling stocks to invest in include Waste Connections, Inc. (NYSE:WCN), Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM), and Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE:RSG). Our Methodology We selected the following recycling stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continues11 Best Recycling Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Nick Fewings on UnsplashBest Recycling Stocks To Buy Now11. Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 8Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG) was founded in 2012 and is headquartered in North Little Rock, Arkansas. It is an environmental services company in the United States, operating through three segments – Assessment, Permitting and Response, Measurement and Analysis, and Remediation and Reuse. It provides its services to the technology, media, chemical, energy, power and utility, industrial and manufacturing, financial, and engineering industries, as well as local, state, provincial, and federal government entities. On December 12, BofA analyst Andrew Obin upgraded Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG) to Buy from Neutral, citing a forecast for accelerating earnings growth in 2023. Montrose Environmental Group (NYSE:MEG) stock also rose on December 12 after the company announced it had acquired Huco Consulting, a company focused on safety and ESG goals, to expand its range of environmental services. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 8 hedge funds were bullish on Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 9 funds in the last quarter. Richard Driehaus’ Driehaus Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 342,461 shares worth $11.5 million. Like Waste Connections, Inc. (NYSE:WCN), Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM), and Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE:RSG), Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG) is one of the best recycling stocks to consider buying. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Montrose Environmental Group, Inc.(NYSE:MEG), an environmental services company, underperformed during the quarter. Despite reiterating guidance for 2022, Montrose underperformed as the market penalized high-growth companies generally. We continue to remain positive on the company’s prospects and ability to achieve or beat its long-term growth target of over 20% per year. We remain particularly excited about Montrose’s potential to benefit from increased government regulation around PFAS chemical contamination and methane emissions.”10. Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 9Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) is a Texas-based company that provides solutions for the reuse, recycling, and disposal of waste streams and recyclables in the United States. It offers disposal and recycling services for motor oil and automotive lubricants, oil filters, scrap tires, goods destruction, food waste, plastics, cardboard, metal, glass, mixed paper, construction debris, and regulated and non-regulated solid, liquid, and gas wastes. Even without gaining new clients, existing customers will likely expand operations and require more waste services, making Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) one of the premier recycling stocks to invest in. On April 18, EF Hutton analyst Chip Moore initiated coverage of Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) with a Buy rating and a $13 price target. As a leading national provider of waste and recycling solutions, Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) is ""differentiated"" by its asset-light, national footprint, and ability to handle comprehensive waste streams, the analyst told investors. He noted that the company has also developed ""valuable"" data warehousing capabilities, offering full waste-stream services for its clients.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 9 hedge funds were long Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) at the end of September 2022, with collective stakes worth $29.5 million, compared to 7 funds in the prior quarter worth $14.7 million. Nelson Obus’ Wynnefield Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 2.5 million shares worth $21.7 million. Here is what Long Cast Advisor specifically said about Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC)  in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) borrowed heavily to purchase Rome RWS, Inc., and with results from the acquired company not yet fully on the income statement, the debt ratios expanded and equity valuations declined. Management – and really the Board – is undertaking a high skill maneuver of integrating its largest acquisition to date, carrying an unprecedented level of debt all concurrent with the long planned retirement of the long tenured CFO. It’s a little more exciting than necessary but the valuation is undemanding and the opportunity set is quite large.Since I’ve long written about what this company could look like if it leaned more deeply into utilizing technology within its two-sided marketplace, I’ll be closely following the XPO Logistics (XPO) spinoff of the truck brokerage business, expected in 4Q22. Truck and waste brokerage share some similar dynamics and as I’ve long noted, the technologist at XPO worked at Oakleaf concurrently with QRHC CEO Ray Hatch. Technology was a big enabling factor at Oakleaf and in XPO’s +10x growth. I think it would have a similar function for QRHC were management to wisely invest time and resources in its development.”9. Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE:LICY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE:LICY) is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, and the company engages in the lithium-ion battery resource recovery and lithium-ion battery recycling business in North America. On October 13, the company announced that it has initiated commercial operations at its lithium-ion battery recycling facility in Alabama. The facility, which is based in Tuscaloosa, uses patented technology to recycle and directly process full EV battery packs without any dismantling through a submerged shredding process that produces no wastewater. Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE:LICY) is one of the premier recycling stocks to invest in. On December 15, ​​Citi analyst P.J. Juvekar maintained a Buy recommendation on Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE:LICY) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $7.50 from $8. The analyst observed that while there is an inclination to go back to cyclical chemical names after having lagged in 2022, he has decided to ""stay defensive"" going into 2023. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 15 hedge funds were long Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE:LICY) at the end of September 2022, and Zilvinas Mecelis’ Covalis Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 11.6 million shares worth $61.8 million. 8. Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) is an Illinois-based company that provides parts cleaning, hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and used oil collection services to small and mid-sized customers in the industrial and vehicle maintenance sectors in the United States and Canada. The company also provides containerized waste management, wastewater vacuum, antifreeze recycling, and field services. Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) is one of the leading recycling stocks to invest in. On October 19, Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) reported Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.01 and a revenue of $172.22 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.21 and $17.23 million, respectively. The Q3 revenue increased nearly 40% compared to the prior-year quarter. Needham analyst James Ricchiuti on October 21 maintained a Buy rating on Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) but trimmed the firm's price target on the shares to $40 from $43 as he noted that the company delivered ""another impressive quarterly report."" Oil business margins are forecasted to shrink in Q4 as a result of downtime in Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI)’s refinery, which may have contributed to the pullback in shares, but it is ""unwarranted,"" the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 19 hedge funds were long Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) at the end of September 2022, compared to 16 funds in the last quarter. Chuck Royce’s Royce &amp; Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.15 million shares worth $34 million. Meridian Funds made the following comment about Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) is an environmental services company focused on machine parts cleaning, used oil collection, oil re-refining, and hazardous and non-hazardous waste services. Our rationale for investing in this company includes the recurring revenue stream it generates from its environmental services business unit and substantial growth opportunities in the re-refinery and used oil collection segments. Continued strong execution and higher oil prices contributed to the stock’s solid performance during the period. Notably, Heritage-Crystal Clean’s oil business segment generated record revenue in the second quarter and saw segment margins improve to 41%, as the spread between base oil sales and the cost of collecting used oil widened. The company’s core environmental services segment also recorded record quarterly revenue. We believe the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) story at Heritage remains under appreciated by the market as the company collects used motor oil and recycles it for reuse. We have high conviction in the long-term growth story for the company, but trimmed our position in the stock during the period as the share price appreciated.”7. PureCycle Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PCT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23PureCycle Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PCT) was founded in 2015 and is headquartered in Orlando, Florida. The company produces recycled polypropylene (PP) and holds a license for restoring waste PP into ultra-pure recycled resin. Its recycling process separates color, odor, and other contaminants from plastic waste feedstock to turn it into virgin-like resin. PureCycle Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PCT) is one of the best recycling stocks to consider. At the end of September 30, the company had total liquidity of $416.1 million, including $215.0 million of cash, cash equivalents, and debt securities available for sale and $201.1 million in restricted cash.On November 11, Cowen analyst Thomas Boyes maintained an Outperform rating on PureCycle Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PCT) but lowered the price target on the shares to $11 from $15. The analyst said as expected, pellet production at Ironton shifted into January and said the facility is still forecasted to fully ramp at the end of 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 23 hedge funds were bullish on PureCycle Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PCT), with collective stakes worth $407.7 million, compared to 23 funds in the prior quarter worth $400.6 million. Daniel Patrick Gibson’s Sylebra Capital Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with more than 29 million shares worth $235.5 million. 6. Casella Waste Systems, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CWST) with a Buy rating and a price target of $95, down from $103. The company offers superior pricing power given its Northeast concentration, as well as the ability to see accelerated margins from operating leverage and efficiency investments, the analyst told investors in a research note. She added that Casella Waste Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CWST) is also the only public waste company its size not to be acquired, which provides ""downside support to valuation on a takeout potential"".According to Insider Monkey’s data, 23 hedge funds were long Casella Waste Systems, Inc.

(NASDAQ:INTU) have declined right along with its peers, falling 38% over the last 12 months.There are some risks to the name, but Intuit provides products and services that are in demand. For instance, TurboTax, QuickBooks, Credit Karma and Mint are used by consumers, small business owners, the self-employed and accounting professionals around the globe. Intuit provides these products and services to more than 100 million customers, giving it a large customer pool with which to work.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with INTU. Click here to check it out. INTU 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of INTUPeter Lynch Chart of INTUThis discussion will dive deeper into why I believe Intuit offers immense upside potential.Earnings highlightsIntuit reported earnings results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 on Nov. 29, with the company easily topping what analysts were expecting. Revenue grew 29.4% to $2.6 billion and was $97 million above estimates. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.66 compared favorably to $1.53 in the prior year and was 46 cents more than anticipated.The Small Business and Self-Employed Group, which accounts for the bulk of revenue, grew 38% to $2 billion. This business benefited from a strong showing in QuickBooks, driven by a healthy combination of customer growth, higher prices and mix.Online services more than doubled to $681 million. The addition of Mailchimp, an engagement and marketing platform acquired in 2021, added $264 million of this growth. Even without the purchase of Mailchimp, online services still grew a healthy 28% due to strength in QuickBooks Online payroll and payment platforms.Revenue for Credit Karma grew 2% to $425 million. This business, which was acquired for $8.1 billion in late 2020, had growth in its credit card business. However, higher interest rates led to declines in home loans, personal loans and auto loans and insurance.Story continuesLeadership presented updated guidance for the fiscal year, with Intuit now expected to produce revenue of $14.035 billion to $14.25 billion, down from a prior forecast of $14.49 billion to $14.7 billion. Still, this would be 11% growth at the midpoint from fiscal year 2022. Adjusted earnings per share are still projected in a range of $13.59 to $13.89, which would equate to 15% to 17% growth.TakeawaysPerhaps the most pressing issue for Intuit is the companys addition of Credit Karma. Originally, the company had forecasted growth of 10% to 15% for the segment. Now, Intuit expects the business to decline 10% to 15% from the previous year. This is a substantial swing in forecasts and no small matter as Credit Karma contributed 16% of first-quarter revenue.As seen in the most recent reporting period, higher interest rates pressured loans for the business. Interest rate hikes may be slowing, but rates are significantly higher today then they were a year ago. This pressure is likely to continue for Credit Karma until, at the very least, high-rate periods are lapped.The good news is Credit Karma is just a small portion of the total business. The Small Business and Self-Employed Group is producing high levels of growth even when excluding revenue from Mailchimp. Intuits tax offerings, which include the combination of both software and accountants, has helped to foster an ecosystem that keeps customers in the fold and likely to continue paying for services. A similar buildout of QuickBooks is also taking place, with the most recent quarter showing robust increases in revenue.These tailwinds should help drive growth, something Intuit has a long history of doing.Intuit Has Headwinds, but Shares Are Deeply UndervaluedRevenue growth has been consistently good over the long term as the compound annual growth rate is above 13% over the last 10 fiscal years, according to Value Line. Net income and earnings per share growth has been slightly higher at 15.7% and 16.6% over this same period. Bottom-line improvement came partially due to a small reduction in the share count, but the net profit margin improved 310 basis points between 2013 and 2022.Even with the headwind of higher interest rates, revenue was still higher by a sizeable amount and revised guidance still points toward double-digit top-line growth.As a result of the negative impact of Credit Karma, revenue forecasts were lowered for the fiscal year, though this is only slightly below the long-term average growth rate. Interestingly, adjusted earnings per share was reaffirmed to be 16% at the midpoint, showing that management expects margins to stay high. Share buybacks will also help here as well.Intuit has a GF Score of 96 out of 100, implying outperformance based on a historical study by GuruFocus. This score reflects perfect ratings for growth and value as well as high ranks for profitability, financial strength and momentum.Intuit Has Headwinds, but Shares Are Deeply UndervaluedValuation analysisWith the stock trading at $391.64, shares of Intuit are trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 28.5. This is below the five- and 10-year average price-earnings ratios of 36.4 and 31.2.The GF Value chart also shows the stock is trading below fair value.Intuit Has Headwinds, but Shares Are Deeply UndervaluedIntuit has a GF Value of $557.60, giving the stock a price-to-GF Value ratio of 0.70. Shares could return as much as 43% if they were to reach their GF Value.Lastly, the yield is low at just 0.8%, but this is not due to a lack of effort on the part of the company. Intuits dividend has a CAGR of almost 17% over the last decade.Final thoughtsThe most recent quarter was mostly positive for Intuit. Revenue and earnings proved to be above estimates. Higher interest rates are keeping a lid on demand for loans in the Credit Karma segment, but most of the business is doing quite well.Intuit does have a rating of possible value trap from GuruFocus. Caution should always be exercised when assessing potential return potential. However, historical performance in combination with a review of the most recent quarter show that Intuit is a top name in its industry and will likely continue to be so as the company has multiple tailwinds that are overcoming the negative impact of Credit Karma on the business.Rarely has Intuit been this undervalued relative to its historical multiples and its GF Value as it is right now. With much of the business demonstrating high rates of growth and the valuation lingering at a very reasonable level, it could be an excellent opportunity.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Stryker has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Stryker peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Stryker.Is There Enough Growth For Stryker?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Stryker's to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 29% gain to the company's bottom line. Still, incredibly EPS has fallen 29% in total from three years ago, which is quite disappointing. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 13% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.1% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why Stryker is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Final WordGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.We've established that Stryker maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Story continuesDon't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Stryker  that you should be aware of.If you're unsure about the strength of Stryker's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

(ECA LNG) and Vista Pacifico, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (Vista Pacifico LNG) received authorization from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to re-export U.S.-sourced liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Mexico to non-Free Trade Agreement (FTA) nations. The DOE's significant action is an important milestone for these two development projects, which now are each one step closer to supporting the world's energy security and environmental goals.""Advancing new infrastructure investments is critical to supporting the energy needs of America's allies, and we are grateful for the leadership of the Biden Administration, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, and various Congressional stakeholders—including Sens. Joe Manchin, Ted Cruz and John Cornyn. These export projects are expected to support efforts across the Indo-Pacific region to diversify energy supplies while transitioning away from coal in power production,"" said Justin Bird, CEO of Sempra Infrastructure. ""They are also expected to help strengthen U.S. trading relationships, as well as create new jobs and boost the U.S. and Mexico economies.""Under the permits granted by DOE, Vista Pacifico LNG is authorized to re-export up to 200 billion cubic feet per year (Bcf/yr) of LNG from U.S.-sourced natural gas from the project under development in Topolobampo, Sinaloa, Mexico to any country with which the United States does not have an FTA requiring national treatment for trade in natural gas. Vista Pacifico LNG is projected to be a mid-scale facility with approximately 3.5 million tons per annum (Mtpa) of export capacity. Sempra Infrastructure is advancing the development of Vista Pacifico LNG in collaboration with Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), as previously announced.The DOE also increased the authorized export volumes of ECA LNG Phase 2, permitting it to re-export up to 636 Bcf/yr of LNG from U.S.-sourced natural gas from the proposed project in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico to non-FTA nations. Both permits are applicable for the period beginning on the date of first commercial re-export through December 2050.Story continuesThe proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 is expected to be comprised of two trains and one LNG storage tank and produce approximately 12 Mtpa of export capacity. ECA LNG Phase 1 received non-FTA export authorization in 2019 and is currently under construction with commercial operations expected in 2025.Development of ECA LNG Phase 2 and Vista Pacifico LNG is contingent upon completing the required commercial agreements, securing all necessary permits, obtaining financing, and reaching a final investment decision, among other factors.About Sempra Infrastructure Sempra Infrastructure delivers energy for a better world.

320,adc294c7-c675-3aad-9674-aa93fec664bc,SRE,2022-12-22,4 Gas Distribution Stocks to Watch in a Challenging Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-gas-distribution-stocks-watch-143402773.html,1671633242,STORY,"['SRE', '^GSPC', 'NJR', 'ATO', 'NWN']","[The production of natural gas in the United States is likely to increase year over year in 2023 per the latest report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) and continue driving stocks in the Zacks Utility Gas Distribution industry. The distribution companies offer services to transport natural gas from the region of production to millions of consumers across the United States.Sempra Energy SRE, with its widespread natural gas infrastructure and systematic investments in infrastructure development projects, is poised to benefit as natural gas production volumes are expected to increase in the 2022-2023 time period. Steady investments and expanding infrastructure in key production regions should drive the performance of Atmos Energy Corporation ATO NewJersey Resources Corporation NJR  and Northwest Natural Holding CompanyNWN.About the IndustryThe shale revolution has substantially increased natural gas production. Its clean-burning nature is steadily boosting demand for natural gas from all customer groups. Natural Gas distribution pipelines play a vital role in delivering natural gas from intrastate and interstate transmission pipelines to consumers through small-diameter pipelines. The natural gas network in the United States has nearly 3 million miles of pipelines. Major concerns for the industry are aging infrastructure and increasing investment costs required to upgrade and maintain the vast network of pipelines due to the hike in interest rates. Competition from other clean sources of energy can lower demand for natural gas, and consequently for pipelines. The expected contraction in U.S economic activity in fourth-quarter 2022 and first-quarter 2023 is a concern.Factors Shaping the Future of the Gas Distribution IndustryAging Distribution Infrastructure: The existing U.S. natural gas distribution pipelines are aging. Leakage or breakage in these old cast iron and bare steel pipelines may result in the disruption of services. At present, natural gas distribution utilities provide services to over 80 million customers in the United States. Per a report from Business Roundtable, replacing the old pipelines will cost around $270 billion. To lower the possibility of interruption in services, the Department of Energy announced $33 million in funding for 10 projects involved in natural gas pipeline retrofitting to rehabilitate existing old cast iron and bare steel pipes.  The Rapid Encapsulation of Pipelines Avoiding Intensive Replacement or the REPAIR program will ensure the minimum extension of the service life of distribution pipelines by 50 years and lower the replacement cost of old pipelines by nearly 10 to 20 times per mile. At present, pipe excavation and replacement costs can go up to $10 million per mile. The rising interest rates will increase the overall project financing cost for the utilities compared with what these companies have enjoyed in the past two years. Despite the efforts of utilities to upgrade pipelines, aging natural gas pipelines also resulted in a few accidents in 2022.Production and Export Volumes of Gas to Increase: The short-term energy outlook released by the EIA indicates that domestic dry natural gas production will grow 3.7% year over year to 98.13 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2022 and 2.3% year over year to 100.38 Bcf/d in 2023. EIA also expects U.S. natural gas consumption to increase 5.38% in 2022 to 88.42 Bcf/d due to higher consumption from all customer groups, while 2023 consumption is expected to drop by 3.4% to 85.40 Bcf/d due to the expectation of milder winter temperature and lower usage from the residential and commercial customer group. EIA expects U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export volumes to increase 8.6% year over year to 10.6 Bcf/d in 2022. The export volume was lower than expected due to an accident in Freeport LNG Export Terminal. With the Freeport terminal resuming operation, EIA expects LNG export volumes to increase 15.6% to 12.25 Bcf/d in 2023.Fresh Investments Create Demand: The clean-burning nature and wide availability across the United States is driving demand for natural gas. The distribution network will continue to play a major role in transporting natural gas to nearly 75 million customers in all parts of the United States. The demand from the rising natural gas customer volume and usage of natural gas to produce electricity will play a pivotal role in the utilities’ gradual transition toward clean energy. Three new LNG export terminals being developed in the United States, there should be increased demand for natural gas pipeline services to transfer the gas from production areas to these terminals. Per EIA, once completed, the three new LNG projects will increase the combined export capacity by 5.7 Bcf/d by 2025. As production and demand for natural gas are increasing, more pipelines will be required to safely transfer the natural gas to end-users.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects.The Zacks Utility Gas Distribution industry — a 15-stock group within the broader Zacks Utilities sector — currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #196, which places it in the bottom 21% of the 251 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Progressive The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At ProgressiveThe President of Personal Lines, Patrick Callahan, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.4m worth of shares at a price of US$126 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$129. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was 59% of Patrick Callahan's holding. Patrick Callahan was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Progressive better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does Progressive Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Progressive insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$236m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Progressive Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Progressive insiders selling. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Progressive.

325,358250ba-cf97-3ac9-9256-b9d9d5af6788,VLO,2022-12-22,Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-corporation-vlo-attracting-140002313.html,1671631202,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy (VLO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this oil refiner have returned -14.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Valero Energy falls in, has lost 0.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $6.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +174.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $27.86 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +891.5%. This estimate has changed -1.8% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.77 indicates a change of -32.6% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -10.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Valero Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $38.83 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +8.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $173.47 billion and $143.78 billion estimates indicate +52.2% and -17.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $44.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +50.6%. EPS of $7.14 for the same period compares with $1.22 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +13.94%. The EPS surprise was +2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

326,831edca2-372b-3eef-8467-f9fb3b688be0,EL,2022-12-22,Those who invested in Estée Lauder Companies (NYSE:EL) five years ago are up 99%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-est-e-lauder-120037324.html,1671710437,STORY,['EL'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. To wit, the Estée Lauder Companies share price has climbed 91% in five years, easily topping the market return of 38% (ignoring dividends).Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Estée Lauder Companies achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 10% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Estée Lauder Companies' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Estée Lauder Companies's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Estée Lauder Companies' TSR for the last 5 years was 99%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 21% in the twelve months, Estée Lauder Companies shareholders did even worse, losing 33% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 15%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Estée Lauder Companies   you should know about.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

Obviously a lot for everyone to unpack here. We're going to take a look at what might be in store for 2023.Now, forecasts see pressure ahead as companies face growing recession risks, but what role could the US dollar play in all of this? I mean, we know that as we saw the yields rise, we saw a lot of people going into the US dollar for safety, wondering what would happen with recession fears. And that's obviously affecting a lot of companies-- multinational companies with exposure in overseas markets, Akiko.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah although we have seen the dollar index come down since the end of November, about 8% right now, and that's kind of been the story here. When you think about what's been playing out among corporates in 2022, it really has been about the strength of the dollar.Now, we've got some companies who are especially exposed to all of this-- Nike, IBM, P&amp;G, Hasbro, Caterpillar, Qualcomm, I mean, basically any company that has a significant exposure outside of the US. The stronger dollar obviously makes those foreign revenue less valuable when they bring it back into the US. So you could argue that as we've seen the dollar weakening, that would potentially be good news for some of these corporate earnings.Now having said that, it's the reason behind the weakening of the dollar that's raised questions about where things could go going into next year. I want to point out a note from Wells Fargo saying they expect a rally in Q1 before things start to weaken, and they've talked about the dollar falling as much as 10%. A lot of that has to do with where the Fed's likely to move. Even though the rate hikes are likely to slow down, that's partly because of the recessionary concerns. That is likely to pull back on the dollar even further.Story continuesAnd right now we're looking at 104.11. Again, worth noting that at the end of November, we were looking at roughly somewhere around 114.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, when we look at some of these predictions for where we could see the S&amp;P going, we know that Morgan Stanley's chief equity strategist Mike Wilson, he sees the S&amp;P falling as much as 21% in Q1. Recovering, though, to about 3,900 by the end of 2023. We saw similar bearishness also from Bank of America as well. They're also expecting that the earnings outlook will deteriorate next year.And a lot of this, the turning point in what they're considering which might push equities back up is whether or not the Fed will halt when it comes to these Fed rate hikes. So a lot of big ifs because there's a lot of data that can come out between now and then. We know the Fed is data dependent, so we'll be keeping an eye on that.]"

330,82de4422-00e6-3deb-a614-14f4133b61f6,DHI,2022-12-22,15 Biggest Construction Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-construction-companies-world-202541094.html,1671654341,STORY,"['DHI', 'NVR', 'FGR.PA', 'EN.PA', 'VCISY', 'CRWOF']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 biggest construction companies in the world. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Construction Companies in the World. The construction industry is a pivotal sector of any economy, and it is also one that is often used by governments to stimulate economic growth. This sector employs millions of people, and government spending leads to more employment and spending in the economy as houses, apartment complexes, road works, and other buildings are built. This in turn also ends up supporting a variety of different industries involving building materials such as wood, cement, and steel.Therefore, it's no surprise that the construction industry is also one of the largest in the world - deemed more valuable than lucrative sectors such as crude oil and automotive. For instance, a research report from Exactitude Consultancy outlines that this sector was worth $11 trillion last year and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.3% between then and 2029 to sit at an estimated worth of $17 trillion. The research firm attributes this growth to rising global populations and more people heading to the cities to earn and live.However, simply due to its scale, the construction sector also carries large risks that can disrupt even the global economy. For instance, the hottest topic in the industry these days is China's Evergrande Group. Evergrande is the second largest property developer in the world's largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity. The Chinese government heavily stimulated the real estate sector in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, so much so that there is now an oversupply of housing units and other buildings - leading to what are called 'ghost cities' made up of large apartment buildings and other complexes that are simply sitting vacant. Evergrande, like other real estate firms, relied heavily on debt to fund its construction.But it was declared a defaulter by S&amp;P Global in December last year after it missed bond payments. The liquidity crisis at Chinese firms started when the government introduced a new policy that limited the debt that they could take to fund new projects. The only problem was that the companies, with massive capital tied in illiquid assets, had relied on raising more debt to pay off earlier debt, relying on the age-old mantra of being 'too big to fail'. A failure at Evergrande threatened to disrupt Western financial markets as well, as large firms such as BlackRock had bought millions of dollars of its debt.Story continuesLike other industries, the construction sector is also relying on new technologies to boost its operations. For instance, companies now use LiDAR sensors to survey land, detect if there are any construction flaws, and map out the terrain on which they plan to build their buildings. Additionally, firms such as Shimabun are selling equipment that makes hardhats connect to the cloud to report on worker health to improve safety.Today's piece will focus on the largest construction companies in the world, with the top players being China State Construction Engineering Corporation Limited (SHA:601668.SS), D.R. Horton, Inc.

We know that pilots, in particular, face unique pressures every time they enter the flight deck.For more than a decade, Project Wingman has been providing our pilots and their family members with additional, specialized support whenever they need it. Established by American and the APA, this peer-to-peer 24/7 helpline allows pilots to reach out to other pilots for emotional and occupational support. Because it protects the privacy of its users, Project Wingman also alleviates any concerns pilots may have regarding the stigma of seeking help.More than 40 pilots currently volunteer for Project Wingman. In addition to bringing a unique understanding of the challenges pilots can face in their professional and personal lives, these volunteers all undergo specialized, intensive training. As a result, they know when to lend a sympathetic ear and provide encouragement or recommend other resources when the situation warrants greater intervention.Project Wingman is managed by a deputy chair of the APA aeromedical committee, and American employs a pilot at the managerial level on a full-time basis to support and promote it. That includes visiting our pilot training programs to talk about it and meeting with the chief pilots on a regular basis.

AAL recently announced that it is putting an end to its 30-year-long collaboration with Mesa Air Group, Inc. MESA.Mesa Air will stop flying American Airlines’ flights from Apr 3, 2023. Also, Mesa Air is actively involved in signing a new five-year deal with United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (UAL). Accordingly, Mesa Air will shift its operations from AAL to UAL from March 2023.With this new deal, UAL will start using Mesa Air’s existing crews. The new contract will also allow Mesa Air to open a crew base in Houston and a new pilot base in Denver, with the potential for other incremental crew bases.Mesa Air used to operate regional flights for both United Airlines and American Airlines and had witnessed profitability even during the initial days of the pandemic when the majority of airline companies faced quarterly losses. However, Mesa Air was unfavorably impacted by the industry-wide pilot shortage issue. As a result, Mesa Air was unable to operate all of its contracted flights with American Airlines.Derek Kerr, American Airlines’ CFO, stated, “As a result, we have concerns about Mesa’s ability to be a reliable partner for American going forward. American and Mesa agree the best way to address these concerns is to wind down our agreement.”Mesa Air CEO Jonathan Ornstein stated, “Once finalized, our expanded agreement with United is expected to both solidify our operations and, in conjunction with our amended agreements with key stakeholders, significantly improve our financial position.”He further added, “Most importantly, after years of reduction in service to smaller and rural communities, this agreement will help turn the tide and is expected to add over 100 regional jet flights into the United network.”Further, Mesa Air has inked another deal with United Airlines, wherein Mesa Air pilots will be able to participate in UAL’s career development programs. This should help Mesa Air hire and retain more pilots and provide them with a better career.Story continuesWe believe that the deal termination with AAL and signing a new deal with UAL should create more opportunities for Mesa Air and enhance it financially.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, both American Airlines and Mesa Air carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

They currently span ages 10 to 25, and the older half is starting to enter the workforce — with their first real jobs after graduation, or part-time and summer jobs while they’re still in school. As soon as they start working at any level, they have access to some valuable opportunities to save for the future. And time is on their side. If they start by setting aside some money when they’re young, their savings can grow significantly by the time they retire.Read More: Best Cities To Retire on a Budget of $1,500 a MonthFind Out: 5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Many young workers are already making saving a priority. Principal Financial Group examined attitudes around financial New Year’s resolutions, and Gen Z leads in ambition for saving more and spending less — 70% planned to save more money in a savings account, and 55% planned to spend less money.It may seem difficult to find money to save when you’re just starting out, but making the most of tax-advantaged savings opportunities and long-term investments can make it so much easier to grow your money for the future. Here’s what Gen Z workers need to know about saving for retirement.1. Start Saving Now, Even Just a Little BitWhen you’re earning your first paychecks, it can be difficult to set aside some of that money for such a distant goal. But figuring out ways to fit some saving into your budget can make a big difference in your financial future.“The easiest advice to save for retirement is to start small and think big,” said Amelia O’Rourke-Owens, co-director of America Saves. “There’s no amount that’s too small to contribute to retirement now, and with compound interest you’ll be thanking yourself 20 years from now.”Managing your budget can help you find some money to save, even when you’re just getting started. “Start by covering your living expenses, paying off debt, building an emergency fund and cutting out unnecessary expenses,” said Kevin Driscoll, vice president of advisory services for Navy Federal Financial Group. “From there, compare your income to your monthly expenses to know how much you can save each month for retirement or other financial goals. Fortunately, investing doesn’t require large amounts of money. Anything you can contribute today, no matter the amount, will make a difference long-term.”Story continuesHaving the extra time for your money to grow is a major advantage. “Find a little bit here and there to save,” said Sri Reddy, senior vice president, retirement and income solutions, Principal Financial Group. “Gen Z has the long-term horizon advantage to scoop up returns in the market, so even just a few bucks pays off via compound interest.”A few ways to find some extra money in your budget: “Check those auto subscriptions to be sure you’re only paying for what you’re using, and reallocate funds from any cancellations,” said Reddy. Also, if you get a raise or bonus, add some of that money into retirement savings right away. “It’s hard to miss money you never saw,” he said.Take Our Poll: Do You Think You Will Be Able To Retire at Age 65?2. Save Automatically — and Get Free Money — With a 401(k)When you do get a full-time job, saving some money in a 401(k) should be one of your top priorities. It’s an easy way to start saving because the money is automatically invested from your paychecks before you have an opportunity to spend it on anything else.“Taking advantage of your employer’s retirement plan is one of the best and most simple ways to begin saving for retirement,” said Driscoll. You can contribute up to $20,500 to a 401(k) in 2022 (and $22,500 in 2023), but even small amounts can make a big difference over the long run. If your employer matches your contributions, try to invest at least enough to get the full employer match – that’s free money. Employers typically match up to 4% of pay, either dollar-for-dollar or 50 cents for every dollar you contribute.“The first and most important question with employer-based retirement plans is — do you get an employer match?” said O’Rourke-Owens. “If yes, what are the requirements you must meet to maximize that match? Then your decision should be guided by how you can maximize any retirement match available from an employer. That’s an employee benefit and basically free money, so you don’t want to ever leave that on the table.”3. Choose Between the Tax Advantages of a Roth 401(k) vs. Traditional 401(k)Your employer may give you the choice of two types of 401(k) contributions: traditional or Roth. With a traditional 401(k), your contributions lower your taxable income now, grow tax deferred, and then the money is taxed when withdrawn. With Roth 401(k) contributions, you don’t get a tax break now but you can withdraw the money tax-free in retirement.If you’re in a low tax bracket now — as so many people are when they’re starting out — you could come out ahead by foregoing the current tax break so you can withdraw the money tax-free in the future, when your tax bracket may be higher. However, if you’re having a tough time stretching your budget, getting the tax break now could help you be able to contribute more money. “If you can afford to save the maximum amount of $22,500 (in 2023), you may consider a Roth 401(k) to avoid future tax implications,” said Reddy. “If you can’t afford that option, you may be better in a pre-tax [traditional] plan, lessening the impact on your current paycheck.”4. Build Tax-Free Savings With a Roth IRA at Any Age You don’t need to be working full-time to start saving for retirement. People of all ages who earn some income from working — even teenagers with part-time or summer jobs — can contribute to a Roth IRA. There’s no minimum age requirement; you just need to have earned some money from working. You can contribute up to the amount of money you earned from your job for the year, with a maximum of $6,000 in 2023.You don’t get a tax break for your contributions, but you can withdraw the earnings tax-free after age 59 ½. And Roth IRAs are flexible: You can withdraw your contributions at any time without penalties or taxes. It’s a great way to start saving without having to worry about tying up all of the money if you need it in an emergency.If you earned a few thousand dollars from working this year, you might not be interested in setting aside all of your earnings for the future. But your parents, grandparents or others can give you some money to contribute, as long as you don’t invest more than you earned from working. If you earned $2,000 in your summer job, for example, you can contribute up to $2,000 for the year.You can open a Roth IRA with a brokerage firm, mutual fund company or bank. Minors can contribute to a custodial Roth IRA — their parents just need to sign extra forms, and they’ll take complete control of the account when they reach the age of majority.You can also contribute to a Roth IRA even if you have a 401(k), too. You just need to earn less than the maximum Roth IRA income limits for the year — which is $153,000 for single workers in 2023, and $228,000 for married couples filing jointly. You can even sign up for automatic investments, so the money is contributed directly from your paychecks or bank accounts, similar to a 401(k).5. Save For the Future in a Health Savings AccountA health savings account can be one of the most valuable retirement-savings tools. That sounds strange, since it was created to help build savings for out-of-pocket medical expenses. But there’s no time limit for using the money, and you can let it grow for the future in this tax-advantaged account. You’ll get a triple tax break: Your contributions are tax-deductible (or pre-tax if through your employer), the money grows tax-deferred and then can be used tax-free for eligible expenses at any time.You can use the money to pay your health insurance deductibles, copayments, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, certain drugstore items, vision and dental care, eyeglasses, prescription sunglasses and many other expenses. There’s no use-it-or-lose-it rule: You can keep building up the savings for the future. If you use it for non-medical expenses, you’ll have to pay taxes and a 20% penalty. But that penalty disappears at age 65, when there are even more ways to use the money tax-free — in addition to other medical expenses, after you turn 65 you can also use the money tax-free to pay premiums for Medicare Part B, Part D and Medicare Advantage plans (you can’t make new HSA contributions after you enroll in Medicare, but you can still use money you already accumulated in the account).As long as you have an HSA-eligible health insurance policy — whether through an employer or on your own — you can contribute up to $3,850 to the HSA for 2023 if you have self-only coverage, or $7,750 for family coverage. If you have a high-deductible policy at work, your employer may contribute money to your account — many employers add $500 or more to HSAs for employees who choose a high-deductible health insurance policy.6. Match Your Investments to Your Long-Term PlanNo matter which type of retirement-savings accounts you choose, be sure to invest the money with the long-term time horizon in mind. Since you don’t need to withdraw the money for 30 years or more, you have time to ride the stock market’s ups and downs for the opportunity to have greater growth over the long run.“Individuals who have decades until they need the money can invest more aggressively, with more money in stocks,” said Driscoll. “Your exact allocation will depend on your goals and your risk tolerance, but always remember to diversify your portfolio across a variety of assets.” For example, you can invest some money in mutual funds that focus on large companies, some on small companies and some on international firms.You don’t need to make all of those decisions yourself. Most 401(k)s and IRAs offer target-date funds that make it easy to maintain a diversified portfolio that matches your timeframe. You choose a fund based on your target retirement date — such as a 2060 fund — and the fund starts out invested more aggressively in stock funds and gradually becomes more conservative, switching more money to bond funds and cash, as your retirement date gets closer.“When you’re younger, you can absorb more risk in your retirement savings, and target retirement funds allow for that,” said O’Rourke-Owens. “As you get closer to retirement age, the asset mix changes to minimize investment risk.”Saving for the future doesn’t need to be complicated. You can save automatically in a 401(k) or IRA, invest in a target-date fund based on your retirement time horizon and let the money grow for the future. “There is no denying that investing early can be a key component in a financially secure retirement,” said Driscoll. “Anyone just beginning their savings journey should keep their investments simple, contribute money consistently and monitor long-term returns. The overall returns on stock market investments are realized over time, not on a daily basis.”More From GOBankingRatesSNAP 2023: Everything To Know About Changes in the Coming YearUsed Car Market: Who Are the Biggest Winners and Losers as Prices Drop?The 10 Best Credit Cards for 2023Expert Tips To Help Improve Your Credit on a Limited IncomeThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 6 Best Retirement Investing Strategies for Gen Z Workers]"

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 2.4%, which is fairly typical for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Aflac Aflac's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Before making this announcement, Aflac was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.EPS is set to fall by 23.4% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 28%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future.historic-dividendAflac Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $0.66 total annually to $1.68. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 9.8% over that duration. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that Aflac has grown earnings per share at 19% per year over the past five years. Aflac definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.We Really Like Aflac's DividendOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Aflac is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Just as an example, we've come across 2 warning signs for Aflac you should be aware of, and 1 of them is potentially serious.

(NYSE:UHS) Suggests It's 29% Undervalued",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-universal-health-services-160407193.html,1671638647,STORY,['UHS'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE:UHS) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Universal Health Services Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$394.0mUS$511.0mUS$598.9mUS$674.7mUS$738.4mUS$791.5mUS$836.2mUS$874.1mUS$907.1mUS$936.4mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 17.21%Est @ 12.64%Est @ 9.44%Est @ 7.20%Est @ 5.64%Est @ 4.54%Est @ 3.77%Est @ 3.23% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$367US$444US$484US$508US$518US$518US$509US$496US$480US$461(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.8bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$936m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.0%) = US$18bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$18b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$8.8bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$14b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$136, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Universal Health Services as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.962. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Universal Health ServicesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Garbage disposals do not prevent grease clogs, and detergents that claim to dissolve grease may cause problems in other parts of the sewer system.Allow grease to cool and use a rubber scraper to remove fat, oil and grease from cookware, plates, utensils and cooking surfaces. Once cooled, place the grease in a sealed container and dispose of it in the trash.Install a strainer in your kitchen sink to catch scraps and empty them into the garbage.Also, avoid flushing wipes, even those labeled flushable or biodegradable, and paper towels down the toilet.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about PepsiCo (PEP) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.PepsiCo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.62, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.62 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy, representing 69.2% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PEPBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PEPCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PepsiCo here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying PepsiCo, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is PEP Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for PepsiCo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.76.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PepsiCo. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for PepsiCo.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced the New England Journal of Medicine has published results from a positive Phase 3 trial showing adults and adolescents treated with Dupixent® (dupilumab) 300 mg weekly experienced significant improvements in signs and symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), which were sustained for up to one year. EoE is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. These data formed the basis for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Dupixent in May 2022, making it the first and only medicine indicated to treat patients with EoE aged 12 years and older, weighing at least 40 kg. These Phase 3 data have been submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to support regulatory approval for adults and adolescents with EoE. The EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recently adopted a positive opinion recommending approval, with a final decision expected in the coming months.""The publication of these Phase 3 results in the New England Journal of Medicine reinforces the impact of the clinical trial data. These data showed dupilumab 300 mg weekly substantially decreased patient symptoms of difficulty swallowing, and led to histological disease remission and improvements in the endoscopic appearance of the esophagus, as compared to placebo,"" said Evan S. Dellon, M.D., M.P.H., Professor of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and co-principal investigator of the trial. ""These data also underscore the role of inhibiting the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways in eosinophilic esophagitis with dupilumab, adding to our growing knowledge of this poorly understood disease.""Story continuesAs published, patients received Dupixent 300 mg either weekly or every two weeks in the Phase 3 trial. Patients receiving Dupixent weekly experienced improvement in the ability to swallow and achieved histological disease remission. Additionally, these patients experienced improved anatomic, cellular, molecular and health-related quality of life measures, with improvements in signs and symptoms of EoE sustained for up to one year. Patients treated with Dupixent every two weeks experienced histological disease remission but did not experience improvement in the ability to swallow. The current FDA-approved dosage for Dupixent as a treatment for children and adults aged 12 years and older with EoE, weighing at least 40 kg, is 300 mg weekly.The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events (≥5%) that were more commonly observed with Dupixent included injection site reactions, nasopharyngitis and rash.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE demonstrate that interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. For people with EoE, swallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. They are often left to contend with the frustration and anxiety of a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid, a poor quality of life and a higher risk of depression. In cases where EoE causes the esophagus to narrow, forced and potentially painful dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed. In severe cases, a feeding tube may be the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. Of the approximately 209,000 patients aged 12 years and older living with EoE in the U.S. who are currently treated with therapies not specifically approved for the disease, about 42,000 continue to experience symptoms despite multiple treatments.About the Dupixent Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE in three parts. Part A enrolled 81 patients and evaluated Dupixent 300 mg weekly for 24 weeks. Part B enrolled 240 patients and evaluated Dupixent 300 mg weekly and every two weeks for 24 weeks. Parts A and B were designed similarly and consisted of separate patient groups. All patients in Parts A and B had an option to participate in Part C for an additional 28 weeks, for up to 52 weeks of Dupixent treatment. Part C enrolled 77 patients from Part A.At 24 weeks, the co-primary endpoints in Parts A and B assessed patient-reported measures of difficulty swallowing and esophageal inflammation. The secondary endpoints included assessments of histopathologic measures of the severity and extent of additional histological measures in the esophagus, and other measures. In Part C, all primary and secondary endpoints assessed in Parts A and B were assessed as secondary endpoints at 52 weeks.About DupixentDupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), EoE and prurigo nodularis (PN).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE or PN in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500,000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb ® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including pediatric EoE, hand and foot atopic dermatitis, chronic inducible urticaria-cold, chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic pruritis of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies.

The GARP approach helps identify stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis.The strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive prospects and trading at a discount. GARP stocks have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and others.Therefore, a portfolio based on the GARP strategy contains stocks that offer the best value and growth investing. Ameriprise Financial AMP, RPM International RPM, W.W. Grainger GWW and Grand Canyon Education LOPE are some GARP stocks that hold promise.GARP Metrics — Mix of Growth &amp; Value MetricsThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. The stocks have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, EPS and others.Growth MetricsA strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Growth rates between 5% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric considered by growth and GARP investors is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with a positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing prioritizes one of the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though the investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Story continuesScreening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS &amp; projected 3-5-year EPS growth rates between 5% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than the M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Here are four of the seven stocks that made it through the screen:Ameriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company that offers a wide range of products and services focused on financial planning and advice.
