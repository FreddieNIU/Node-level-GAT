The company deals with a huge amount of data that exposes it to operational risks.The company has an impressive Growth Score of A. This style score condenses all the essential metrics from a company’s financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth.Verisk reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2023 results. Adjusted earnings (excluding 92 cents from non-recurring items) were $1.29 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.3%. This was due to strong segmental revenue growth and core operating leverage. Adjusted earnings decreased 3.7% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenues of $651.6 million surpassed the consensus estimate by 3.1% and decreased 16% from the year-ago figure. The reduced top line can be correlated to the sale of the company’s environmental health and safety business (""3E"") and the Financial Services segment.Verisk has outperformed its Business Information Services market growing 28.9%, compared with its industry’s 8.1% growth and 16.5% rise in the S&amp;P 500 composite.Verisk Analytics, Inc.

QuoteCurrent situation of VRSKVerisk has a robust growth strategy that focuses on organic growth, product development and acquisitions.

The March 2022 acquisition of Opta is expected to expand its footprint in the Canadian market. The acquisition of Automated Insurance Solutions is expected to increase the company’s automation capabilities in the claims ecosystem and help it expand geographically. The acquisitions help the company increase its global footprint and add to the company’s existing capacities.Story continuesVRSK has been consistent with returning value to its shareholders. In 2022, Verisk paid $195.2 million as dividends and repurchased shares worth $1.7 billion. Such moves indicate the company’s commitment to creating value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business.Verisk's current ratio at the end of first-quarter 2023 was pegged at 0.89, higher than the current ratio of 0.40 reported at the end of the prior quarter and 0.47 at the end of the year-ago quarter, indicating the company is unlikely to face difficulties meeting its short term debt obligations.Some Concerning PointsVerisk’s huge database exposes it to operational risks of security breaches, computer networks, and databases, resulting in the loss of its credibility and/or customers.

Our concerns over financials with asset/liability mismatches and those making very long-duration bets led us to reduce our bank exposure in 2022 for example, with trims to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW). We trimmed Schwab further in the quarter due to the potential for more regulatory scrutiny and heightened risk of “cash sorting” as customers shift low-yielding deposits into higher-yielding options such as money market funds and U.S. Treasurys. While this impacts the company’s earnings in the near term, roughly 80% of its deposits are FDIC insured and we believe the vast majority of the deposits are likely to stay inside of the Schwab ecosystem where the company can still collect fee and spread income over time.""Story continuesfinance, investmenteverything possible/Shutterstock.comThe Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on the financial state of retirees and retiring in Central America, you may go to 5 Best Cities to Retire in Central America.The Financial State of RetireesAre you afraid of outliving your assets? 70% of Americans today feel financially stressed, reports CNBC. They are working longer, spending less, increasing their stock exposure, and delaying claim on social security benefits. While these endeavors may be well-intentioned, without planning, they are merely blind attempts. As such, failure to adequately plan is a significant retirement blunder by retirees, leading them to save insufficiently for their golden years.As a result, millions of Americans today are nearing their golden years financially unprepared. The US Census Bureau data notes that 50% of women, and 47% of men between ages 55 and 66, have no retirement savings at all. While saving for retirement is a must, AARP highlights that nearly 57 million Americans work for employers without a retirement savings plan.Only 14 US states today have state-facilitated payroll deduction retirement savings or ""Work &amp; Save"" programs for their employees. Such retirement savings plans are a convenient way for individuals to save for retirement. Savings ensure retirees have additional resources beyond their social security. It must be noted here that average social security benefits are only $1,600 a month, while average monthly expenditures for those 65 or older easily hover around $4,345. The grave disparities between income and expenditure have led many seniors to live below poverty line in the USA. The latest US Census Bureau data highlights that poverty among Americans aged 65 or older has increased from 8.9% in 2020 to 10.3% in 2021.In order to retire comfortably, corporations such as Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) can help retirees take the right steps. Retirement solutions at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) help individuals, families, and institutions reach their financial goals. Similarly, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) can help employees open Individual Retirement Accounts, or IRAs, for funding retirement years.Story continuesAll three corporations, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), are also good stocks to invest in, considering the aging baby boomer population being one of the factors for rising demand of financial services.Retiring in Central and South AmericasConsidering the lack of retirement funds and the graying demographics in parts of the USA, many retirees are considering relocation to cheaper areas such as the South. Apart from the South, there are plenty of affordable places to retire on the East Coast. For those looking to move away from the US, another possible option on many retiree’s radars is Central America. Moving to Central America has many advantages for retirees.

The climate is pleasant and warm throughout the year too.Moreover, many countries, such as Panama and Costa Rica, have reputable healthcare systems.

Retiring in Panama can also help individuals stretch their dollar incomes, with the cost of living as affordable as $1,200 a month.While Central America is one of the cheapest places for retirement, South America can also be a good place to consider for affordable living. Some of the best places in South America to live include Buenos Aires, Argentina; Lima, Peru; Quito, Ecuador; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Florianopolis, Brazil.

SWCAX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 5 (Strong Sell), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerSWCAX is a part of the Schwab Funds family of funds, a company based out of San Francisco, CA. Since Schwab California Tax-Free Bond Fund made its debut in February of 1992, SWCAX has garnered more than $408.01 million in assets. A team of investment professionals is the fund's current manager.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 0.95%, and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of -1.13%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Compared to the category average of 4.82%, the standard deviation of SWCAX over the past three years is 4.9%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 4.54% compared to the category average of 4.65%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.SWCAX carries a beta of 0.73, meaning that the fund is less volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. With this in mind, it has a negative alpha of -0.7, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis.ExpensesCosts are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, SWCAX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.38% compared to the category average of 0.77%. SWCAX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.Story continuesInvestors need to be aware that with this product, the minimum initial investment is $0; each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.Bottom LineOverall, even with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, Schwab California Tax-Free Bond Fund ( SWCAX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and therefore looks a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.This could just be the start of your research on SWCAXin the Mutual Fund Bond category.

7,91a7af54-95b6-3678-bf7b-8143132fd397,PVH,2023-07-04,"PVH Corp (PVH) Rises 20.4% YTD, To Gain From Growth Strategies",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pvh-corp-pvh-rises-20-122700862.html,1688387220,STORY,['PVH'],"[PVH Corp’s PVH performance has been impressive since the beginning of this year, evident from the 20.4% increase in its share price. The company has been gaining from the momentum in its core brands — Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. Strength in the international business bodes well.Year to date, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has outperformed the industry’s 1.4% growth and the S&amp;P 500’s rally of 16.9%.Let’s delve into the factors aiding this stock for a while now. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research What’s Driving PVH?PVH Corp's Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands continued to perform well in first-quarter fiscal 2023, driven by robust consumer demand. Tommy Hilfiger’s quarterly revenues were up 5%, whereas Calvin Klein’s revenues were flat year over year.Calvin Klein witnessed a record-breaking consumer engagement, driven by the most impactful version of the Calvins or nothing campaign. This campaign generated 1.7 billion impressions across PR and social media, leading to the expansion of its social following, with 1.6 million new followers. Owing to this, the brand witnessed a significant rise in traffic in owned and operated e-commerce sites.In another development, Calvin announced popular K Pop Star, Jungkook, as the brand ambassador, leading to a more than 39% increase in site visits across all regions and a visible lift in sales.The brand also launched Jennie for Calvin Klein — a unique limited edition capsule collection designed in partnership with Jennie Kim of Blackpink. The collection, which is Jennie's personal take on hero products and style essentials in denim, underwear and other key categories, generated nearly 700 million social media impressions, along with key products that sold-out within two days of release.Coming to Tommy, the brand continues to drive strong visibility and relevance among consumers, generating 5.5 billion impressions and 56 million social engagements globally in the quarter. Its Classics Reborn spring campaign has been performing well. Its collaboration with Shawn Mendes continued to show momentum. The brand also revealed plans to partner with Disney as part of the latter’s 100th milestone anniversary.Going forward, management remains confident about the underlying power of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, which position the company’s business to succeed amid the ever-changing consumer landscape.PVH Corp’s international business has been witnessing growth for quite some time now. The company witnessed continued momentum in the international unit in the fiscal first quarter.Notably, the international unit’s revenues jumped 9% year over year on a constant-currency (cc) basis, driven by product strength and solid consumer engagement, particularly in Asia. Going ahead, management expects the international business to drive growth.This led to the solid first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the bottom and top lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. Adjusted earnings were $2.14 per share, up 10% from the year-ago quarter’s $1.94.Story continuesRevenues rose 2% year over year (up 5% on a cc basis) to $2,158 million, mainly driven by the solid performance in its international businesses, particularly in the Asia Pacific region, continued growth in Europe and the North America direct-to-consumer business.Driven by these factors, fiscal 2023 revenues are anticipated to grow 3-4% (up 2-3% on a cc basis). This is in sync with our estimate. The bottom line is expected to be $10 per share for the year, whereas it reported $3.03 on a GAAP basis and $8.97 on an adjusted basis last year. The view includes a positive impact of 15 cents from favorable currency.Further, the gross margin is likely to expand 100 bps year over year, driven by a favorable shift in the channel and regional mix stemming from its higher-margin DTC business as part of the PVH+ Plan and lower freight costs due to recovered supply-chain conditions. The operating margin is estimated to be 10%, whereas EBITDA is forecast to grow in the high-single digits.PVH Corp’s multi-year strategy, PVH+ Plan, aims to accelerate growth by boosting its core strengths, and connecting Calvin Klein and TOMMY HILFIGER brands with consumers through five major drivers. These drivers are — win with product; win with consumer engagement; win in the digitally-led marketplace; develop a demand and data-driven operating model; and drive efficiencies and invest in growth.The company expects to strengthen its presence in the global demand spaces, wherein its iconic labels resonate well with consumers. Management reinforces the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands so that these can cater to consumers’ needs in new and engaging ways.PVH is focused on fueling digital growth by developing a holistic distribution strategy for Calvin Klein and TOMMY HILFIGER, driven by digital and direct-to-consumer channels and wholesale partnerships. It looks to develop a demand and data-driven operating model with a systematic and repeatable product creation model. This model will put consumers first, leveraging data to offer fresh products.The company also focuses on boosting efficiencies to be cost-competitive and, in turn, reinvest in strategic plans. In sync with its plans, PVH remains on track to reduce 10% of its workforce in its global offices by the end of 2023. The move is likely to generate savings of more than $100 million, which will be reinvested in digital, supply-chain and consumer engagement related to the PVH+ Plan.In a recent development, PVH Corp announced the extension of its license agreements with G-III Apparel Group from 2025 to 2027 as part of the PVH+ plan. The deal will enable the smooth transition of core product categories back to PVH at the end of the extended terms. The transaction mainly includes Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands in the United States and Canada, particularly the women’s North American wholesale business.Headwinds to OvercomePVH Corp has been reeling under the ongoing macroeconomic challenges. High raw material costs and currency headwinds hurt its margins in first-quarter fiscal 2023. The gross margin contracted 50 bps to 57.9% due to higher product costs, the negative impact of foreign exchange and abnormally high raw material costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2.4% year over year to $1,064 million.Earnings before interest and taxes totaled $199 million compared with $210 million in the prior-year quarter and our estimate of $252 million. This is mainly due to lower gross margins stemming from inventory costs. The metric also included $9 million of adverse foreign currency impacts.For fiscal 2023, management expects SG&amp;A expenses as a percentage of revenues to expand 70 basis points year over year due to expenses related to investments in the DTC and international businesses.Also, the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 guidance seems dull due to global inflationary pressures. It expects revenue growth in the low-single digits on both reported and cc basis. The bottom line is likely to be $1.70, whereas it reported $1.72 in the year-ago quarter on a GAAP basis and $2.08 on an adjusted basis.ConclusionAlthough inflation-led high costs remain near-term headwinds, we believe that strength in core brands and the international unit, as well as gains from the PVH+ Plan, are likely to help the stock sustain its momentum. Notably, a Value Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 15.8% raise optimism in the stock.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Bluegreen Vacations BVH, Royal Caribbean RCL and lululemon athletica LULU.Bluegreen Vacations sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

However, with a price tag of $12.99 for two 28-ounce jars, it might be a bit heavy on the wallet.In contrast, Great Value’s natural no-stir creamy peanut butter offers a budget-friendly alternative, priced at just $1.84 for a 16-ounce jar. According to Harrison, it may not be as smooth as Kirkland’s, but it’s still delicious — and available at a fraction of the price.I’m a Financial Planning Expert: 6 Worst Purchases To Make in an Economic DownturnSea SaltCostco has Walmart beat when it comes to this pantry staple.

But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) shareholders have seen the share price rise 54% over three years, well in excess of the market return (33%, not including dividends).The past week has proven to be lucrative for MetLife investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's three-year performance. See our latest analysis for MetLife To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over the last three years, MetLife failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 52% (annualized).This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Given this situation, it makes sense to look at other metrics too.Do you think that shareholders are buying for the 1.3% per annum revenue growth trend? We don't. So truth be told we can't see an easy explanation for the share price action, but perhaps you can...The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthMetLife is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for MetLife in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for MetLife the TSR over the last 3 years was 71%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in MetLife had a tough year, with a total loss of 7.2% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 16%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 9%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance.

Purchasing managers surveys showed a similar factory downturn in the euro zone.""At least the improved supply-demand imbalance seems to be having an effect on price pressures,"" Capital Economics global economist Ariane Curtis said.Despite evidence that goods inflation was easing off, Curtis cautioned that central bankers might keep policy tight to battle service-sector inflation ""which has proven stickier"".In the U.S., Barclays analysts said in a note to clients, ""rising real incomes, thanks to a strong labor market, will continue to support consumption,"" despite the recessionary signals from the weak ISM data.MIXED BAG OF DATAInvestors are watching out for a mixed bag of economic data ahead of second-quarter earnings while uncertainty remains over the outlook for Fed monetary policy, said Manishi Raychaudhuri, head of Asia Pacific equity research at BNP Paribas.Story continuesThe minutes from the central bank's last meeting are due later this week and could provide additional clues on policy direction, but also inject some volatility, he said.""If the Fed over-tightens and decides to do more rate hikes than twice, as the market widely expected, then there's a concern that the recession may turn out to be deeper than what is being factored in,"" Raychaudhuri said.Geopolitical tensions also persist, he noted, with China's export controls on minerals adding more uncertainty around global trade relations.In the currency market, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major peers, was flat. The euro dipped 0.1% lower against the dollar to $1.0898.Euro zone government debt was steady, with Germany's two-year Schatz yield, which tracks interest rate expectations, drifting around the 3.32% level, around its highest since early March, just before a U.S. regional banking crisis drove a flight into safe havens.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was trading $1.44 higher at $71.23.""Clearly, the Saudis are taking proactive and pre-emptive steps to stabilize the price of crude oil as well as see gains to reach $80 a barrel to sustain their domestic budgets,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Houston-based Lipow Oil Associates.Even so, the market will wait to verify Russia's announced cuts, and concerns continue that high interest rates will weigh on global demand, Lipow said.Oil benchmarks settled about 1% down in the previous session, as a gloomy macroeconomic outlook served to erase early gains.U.S. markets were closed on Tuesday for the Independence Day holiday.Little has changed in oil dynamics despite Monday's announcements, said OANDA analyst Craig Erlam. ""Only a significant break above $77 will suggest something has changed, otherwise range-bound trade could well continue.""Business surveys have shown a slump in global factory activity because of sluggish demand in China and Europe, and U.S. manufacturing also fell further in June to levels last registered in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.Story continuesThis broader uncertainty is likely to overshadow OPEC+ efforts to tighten supply, some analysts said.Even before the latest cut announcements, International Energy Agency (IEA) data suggested the oil market was set to show a supply deficit of roughly 2 million bpd in the third and fourth quarters, Commerzbank analysts said.Oil prices did not jump significantly on the news, largely because of demand concerns over China's sluggish economic recovery after the lifting of pandemic restrictions. Meanwhile, interest rates in the U.S. and Europe are expected to rise further to address persistently high inflation, the analysts said.(Reporting by Natalie Grover in London and Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba; Additional Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar in Houston and Trixie Yap in Singapore; Editing by Mark Potter, Alexander Smith, David Goodman and Bill Berkrot)]"
25,f3168da8-ba7d-337f-b39c-690699871441,O,2023-07-04,Saudi Arabia Sets The Stage For Big OPEC Production Cuts,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/saudi-arabia-sets-stage-big-000000947.html,1688428800,STORY,"['2222.SR', 'CL=F']","[OPEC last week underlined that Asia’s continued strong economic growth would account for virtually all the growth in demand for oil this year. Saudi Aramco added that China and India will drive oil demand growth of more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in the period. Just prior to these two comments, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that OPEC and its allies are in “a state of readiness” amid a divergence between the physical and futures oil markets. These actions, he added, would be “precautionary […,] part and parcel of what we call being proactive and pre-emptive.” For oil trading insiders what these comments add up to is OPEC, and its de facto leader Saudi Arabia, setting the stage for further major ad hoc cuts in their oil production aimed at pushing oil prices much higher. The traders didn’t have to wait long. Saudi Arabia, on Monday morning, announced that it was extending its voluntary 1 million bpd production cut through August, sending oil prices rising by 1%.Taking a look at the longer term, the demand question comes first: someone somewhere in Saudi Arabia, Saudi Aramco and/or OPEC must know full well that the scale and scope of growth this year in the powerhouse Asian economy of China is extremely uncertain. As highlighted in several previous articles by me in OilPrice.com, a cyclical recovery in China for the first time will be led by household consumption, mainly services, as there is a great deal of pent-up demand and savings - about 4 percent of GDP - following three years of intermittent mobility restrictions. For oil prices, as TS Lombard’s chief China economist, Rory Green, has repeatedly stressed, it is apposite to note that transportation accounts for just 54 percent of China’s oil consumption, compared to 72 percent in the U.S. and 68 percent in the European Union. This all leads to the situation in which China now finds itself, of patchy growth and major drags remaining in the economy. In oil market terms, what this means is a rise in net import volumes certainly, but one which is unlikely to cause oil prices to surge, especially as China is buying oil at a discount from Russia, Iran, and Iraq, among others. Broadly the same economic and oil demand dynamics are also in play, mainly for the same post-COVID-19 reasons, in the other great Asian economy of India.Story continuesConsequently, by predicating the argument that global oil demand will be driven by these countries, and others with similar economic profiles in Asia, OPEC and Saudi Arabia are preparing the ground for future oil price-supportive cuts in production when this supposedly expected demand does not fully materialise but oil supply needs to be supported for sudden rises in demand. The method of such cuts has already been laid out (“precautionary […,] part and parcel of what we call being proactive and pre-emptive”), and the rationale has been expounded several times before by OPEC and Saudi Arabia (because they are dealing with “uncertainties and sentiment” that are “working against” the alliance). These comments by Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman build on his earlier statements that the global oil market must be supported through higher pricing in order that it can cater for future demand spikes and not find itself short of supplies as the world transitions to cleaner energy.What all these comments amount to is that OPEC and Saudi Arabia want oil prices much higher than they are now but know that the U.S. and its key allies in the West and the East want the opposite and are working busily to keep them lower. In theory, Saudi Arabia has a fiscal breakeven oil price of US$78 pb of Brent in 2023. In practice, though, as the fiscal breakeven oil price is the minimum price per barrel that an oil-exporting country needs to meet its expected spending needs while balancing its budget, Saudi Arabia’s true fiscal breakeven oil price is a lot higher than that. It is true that the average cost of extracting one barrel of oil in Saudi Arabia (and in Iran and Iraq too) is just US$1-2. With genuine capital expenditure added in then, this per barrel lifting cost is around US$6-8. However, it is also true that there is a huge difference between this actual cost and the official Saudi Arabian fiscal breakeven oil price and that this difference is accounted for by Saudi’s real-world spending. And this spending can vary wildly from one month to the next based solely on a passing whim.This was one of the key reasons why the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco failed to attract any notable buyers from the West, as analysed in full in my new book on the new global oil market order. Examples of unappealing Saudi socio-economic projects at that time included developing a US$5 billion ship repair and building complex on the east coast, working with General Electric on a US$400 million forging and casting venture, and even creating the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. At the same time, a new extravagant vanity project was in the offing in the shape of the then-costed US$500 billion Neom project. According to its own advertisements, Neom would be ‘An Accelerator of Human Progress’ that may include such features as an artificial moon, glow-in-the-dark beaches, flying drone-powered taxis, robotic butlers to clean the homes of residents and a Jurassic Park-style attraction featuring ‘animatronic’ lizards. Predictably, this idea was not well-received by would-be international investors in the US or UK.On the other hand, the U.S. and its main allies in the West and the East are broadly net importers of oil and gas, so sustained oil prices above US$80 pb of Brent, and corollary rising gas prices, mean that inflation will remain higher for longer, which will keep interest rates higher for longer, which will increase the economic damage done to them. For the U.S., these fears have very specific ramifications: one economic and one political, as also analysed in my new book on the new global oil market order. The economic one is that historically every US$10 pb change in the price of crude oil results in a 25-30 cent change in the price of a gallon of gasoline. For every 1 cent that the average price per gallon of gasoline rises, more than US$1 billion per year in consumer spending is lost, and the U.S. economy suffers. The political one is that, according to statistics from the U.S.’s National Bureau of Economic Research, since the end of World War I in 2018, the sitting U.S. president has won re-election 11 times out of 11 if the U.S. economy was not in recession within two years of an upcoming election. However, sitting U.S. presidents who went into a re-election campaign with the economy in recession won only one time out of seven. This is not a position sitting President Joe Biden, or the Democratic Party, wants to be in one year out from the next U.S. election.These are the reasons why the U.S. has long sought to rigorously enforce a price range for the Brent crude oil benchmark of US$40-45 pb on the floor (the price at which U.S. shale oil producers can survive and make decent profits) to US$75-80 pb on the ceiling (the price after which economic threat becomes apparent to the U.S. and its allies, and political threat looms for sitting U.S. presidents). This rigorous enforcement saw its apotheosis under former President Donald Trump, as also analysed in my new book on the new global oil market order. When Saudi Arabia (with the help of Russia) was pushing oil prices up over the US$80 pb of Brent level in the second half of 2018, Trump sent a clear warning to Riyadh to stop doing this. In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, the then-President said: “We defend many of these nations for nothing, and then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices. Not good. We want them to stop raising prices. We want them to start lowering prices, and they must contribute substantially to military protection from now on.” In short, during Trump’s entire presidency, the ‘U.S./Trump Oil Price Range’ was breached only once for a period of around three weeks (toward the end of September 2018 to the middle of that October).Right now, these are also the key reasons why the U.S. has not been too perturbed about Russia undercutting its supposed ‘OPEC+’ brothers to sell as much oil as it can, including to China and India. Legal or illegal, such supplies have the net effect of bringing global oil prices down. The same rationale applies to the U.S.’s view of oil sales from Iran directly to China, or of Iranian oil sold to multiple other countries through its willing conduit Iraq. The details of such sales and the methodology that facilitates them is also analysed in full in my new book on the new global oil market order.By Simon Watkins for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why The EU Is Hesitant To Implement Its New Sanctions FrameworkWhat China’s Solar Dominance Means For Global TradeChina’s Bid For Energy Security Fuels Long-Term LNG Buying SpreeRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

The readings brewed more concerns that global economic conditions will worsen this year, weighing on crude demand.Brent oil futures fell 0.2% to $74.86 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 0.4% to $70.05 a barrel by 21:28 ET (01:28 GMT). Both contracts closed in a flat-to-low range on Monday, following a volatile session.OPEC meeting in focusThe Saudi and Russian supply cuts come just before a conference held by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies this week. Chief executives from major global oil firms are set to meet with energy ministers from the OPEC states on Wednesday and Thursday, potentially offering more cues to oil markets.The OPEC cut oil production twice this year to support prices.

The central bank had kept interest rates on hold last month, but flagged at least two more hikes this year.Story continuesThe prospect of rising interest rates weighed heavily on oil prices this year, as markets feared more headwinds to demand from tighter monetary conditions.Substantially weaker-than-expected manufacturing data from the world’s largest economies furthered this notion on Monday, pressuring crude markets.Focus this week is also on nonfarm payrolls data for June, which is also expected to factor into the Fed’s plans for interest rates.Related ArticlesOil treads water as markets weigh supply cuts, manufacturing slumpChina to restrict exports of chipmaking materials as US mulls new curbsGold moves further above $1,900 support, more Fed cues awaited]"

All three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, indicating optimism surrounding their current outlooks.In addition, all three are forecasted to witness significant growth. Let's take a closer look at each.NvidiaNVDA shares have delivered a remarkable performance since their 2022 October lows, up more than 250%. The company's Artificial Intelligence (AI) operations have become a big focus among investors, with buyers consistently stepping up to get exposure to Wall Street's shiny new toy.As we all know, the company shocked the entire market following its blowout quarter, posting results well above expectations and providing bullish revenue guidance. Nvidia upped its revenue guidance for its 2024 Q2 to $11 billion, well above previous expectations.Another bright highlight in the quarter came from NVDA's Data Center segment, which includes AI operations. Data Center posted record revenue of $4.3 billion, climbing an impressive 14% from the year-ago quarter and 9% above the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Following the blowout quarter, analysts have become notably bullish on the company's outlook, with earnings expectations jumping across all timeframes. The stock is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Impressively, the company is now expected to post 130% earnings growth in its current fiscal year (FY24) on 60% higher revenues.Story continuesSalesforceSalesforce, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is the leading provider of on-demand Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Shares had a brutal 2022 but have stopped for little in 2023, up nearly 60%.The company has enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions across the board, with the revisions trend particularly noteworthy for its upcoming quarterly release expected in late August. CRM posted results above expectations in its latest release, reporting 11% revenue growth and positive results across all segments.CRM's growth is slated to continue, with estimates calling for 42% earnings growth on 11% higher revenues in its current fiscal year (FY24). And looking ahead to FY25, estimates allude to 21% earnings growth on 11% higher sales.Palo Alto NetworksCybersecurity titan Palo Alto Networks posted results that impressed the market in its latest release, with shares seeing an 8% jump post-earnings in the following trading session. The stock is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with analysts taking their expectations higher across the board.Further, the company updated its cash flow margin and operating guidance due to its focus on profitability, which is undoubtedly a positive. PANW also expects FY23 revenues in a range of $6.88 - $6.91 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 23.5% year-over-year growth.The company's top line growth has been rapid.Regarding earnings, the $4.27 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate suggests growth of nearly 70% year-over-year for its current fiscal year. In FY24, estimates suggest a further 17% of earnings growth.Bottom LineWith the Nasdaq delivering an unbelievable first half, those with patience have been rewarded handsomely in 2023, enjoying serious gains.And all three tech heavyweights above have seen their earnings outlooks drift significantly higher amid the optimism and other market-friendly developments.In addition, all three carry impressive growth projections, making them solid considerations for any investor with a growth-focused mindset.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Analysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.The rally in global equities extended into Asia on July 3, buoyed by positive momentum from Wall Street and indications of easing US inflation. Shanghai's equities surged over 1%, and technology companies listed in Hong Kong saw a substantial increase of around 3%. Furthermore, shares of Asian electric-vehicle manufacturers and their suppliers experienced gains, as Tesla Inc. and BYD Co. reported record sales in the second quarter. According to Bloomberg, Japan's Topix index was poised for further gains, reaching levels not seen since the mid-1990s, thanks to increased confidence among major manufacturers. The rise in Chinese stocks on Monday stood in contrast to the 6% decline witnessed in MSCI Inc.'s China Index during the first half of the year. While some investors remain cautious due to policy risks and China's modest economic recovery, others view the market's attractive valuations as an opportunity.Gold prices remained relatively unchanged on July 3 as the strength of the U.S. dollar weighed on the appeal of bullion. Market participants eagerly awaited key economic data to gain further insights into the Federal Reserve's stance on future interest rate hikes. Despite stagnant U.S. consumer spending in May, indicating that the Fed's efforts to curb inflation were having some effect, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose by 4.6% year-on-year, slightly lower than April's increase of 4.7%. According to CME's Fedwatch tool, investors are currently assigning an 87% probability of a 25 basis points rate hike in July. Reuters reported that interest rates are expected to remain in the range of 5.25% to 5.5% before potentially seeing cuts in 2024. Gold experienced a 2.5% decline in the second quarter, mainly driven by the anticipation of a prolonged period of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Higher interest rates typically discourage investment in non-yielding assets like gold.Story continuesAs the second half of the year began, the price of oil remained relatively stable, with traders closely monitoring demand challenges and a complex supply outlook. Brent crude managed to stay above $75 per barrel after experiencing four consecutive quarterly losses, marking its weakest performance in over 30 years of recorded data. Throughout this year, oil prices have declined by approximately 12% due to factors such as a slowdown in China's economic recovery, concerns about a potential US recession, and abundant supplies fueled by robust exports from Russia and Iran. According to Bloomberg, these dynamics have contributed to a cautious market sentiment surrounding oil.Bond investors could benefit in 2023 if indicators suggesting central banks may tighten policy excessively and push their economies into recession are accurate, reported Reuters. While headline inflation has eased, underlying pressures remain high, leading central banks to maintain a hawkish stance. Recent moves by Canada, Britain, and Norway to tighten policy and signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank officials indicated further rate hikes. Markets anticipate a 25 basis point Fed hike in July, reduced expectations for cuts next year, and increased projections for ECB and Bank of England hikes. Additionally, yield curve inversion has deepened as shorter-dated bond yields surge, reflecting concerns of a potential recession.On the stocks market front, analysts are bullish on healthcare stocks such as 89bio, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETNB) and Accolade, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACCD) along with sports apparel and equipment stock NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE).

(NYSE:BLD), headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida, is a company that operates in the field of installing and distributing building materials for commercial, industrial, and residential purposes.

(NYSE:BLD) to $285 from $225. However, despite the price target increase, Loop Capital maintains a Hold rating on the shares. This indicates a neutral stance on the stock's potential performance.

(NASDAQ:PANW)Upside Potential: 12%According to a research note from Scotiabank issued on June 30, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) raised its price target from $269 to $285. This update suggests a more positive outlook on the company's stock performance. Scotiabank's new price target implies a potential upside of 12.50% from the current price of Palo Alto Networks.

(NYSE:PANW) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“Within Information Technology, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) offers network security solutions to enterprises, services providers, and government entities.

(NYSE:IPG) is a major advertising and marketing company. Interpublic Group of Companies Inc. (NYSE:IPG) has gained about 55% over the past 12 months.

Thank you mom and dad for the genes (and thanks Ulta's COO for the skin cream recommendation).Two, Overstock.com purchased Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's website and will change its name to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. I personally would never want to be associated with failure and bad vibes — yet here is Overstock going all in on both.I wish the team there well in trying to walk around in a zombie's skin.morning brief imageAnd lastly, I — along with investors I have chatted up — have been surprised by the performance of most restaurant stocks. That's across the board from fast food plays such as McDonald's to sit-down eateries in the mold of Olive Garden owner Darden.Everything but the kitchen sink has been tossed at restaurant companies and their stocks this year.Slowing GDP growth has taken hold, which usually doesn't translate to strong financial results from restaurants. Rising menu prices have consumers thinking twice about a family dinner out on the town.Higher average hourly earnings for waiters, waitresses, and back-of-house staff are weighing on profits. Inflation has hit everybody.And of course, much higher interest rates make putting 10 orders of pizza from Papa John's after a kid's sports game on a credit card adds another expensive wrinkle.Even the infatuation with AI stocks serving to suck investment dollars from other sectors in the market could be viewed as a headwind.Yet here we stand, with most restaurant stocks doing quite well for the year. Restaurant sales as sourced by the Census Bureau have trended higher in recent months. As you can see in our nifty infographic, same-store sales for most major chain restaurants strengthened in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 2022.Story continuesMcDonald's, for example, saw higher sales in the first quarter on the back of higher menu prices and guest counts.Winning recipe.Veteran restaurant analyst Danilo Gargiulo at Bernstein tells me there are at least three reasons behind the moves in the stocks and the financial resilience:""Restaurants are an affordable luxury: even if consumers’ wallets are more squeezed, the typical spending reduction occurs among durable goods and large ticket items first; reduction in spending at restaurants is the last resort.Unemployment rate is still low. The biggest negative impact on restaurant demand comes from reducing disposable income and increasing unemployment rate. Consumer sentiment and future outlook matter, but only marginally. Today we are still enjoying healthy employment rates in the United States, favoring restaurants’ demand.Restaurant prices have grown less than grocery prices. The relative inflation of food at home (i.e. grocery) vs food away from home (restaurants) has once more favored restaurants’ demand, given that the pricing actions taken by restaurants have been significantly more moderate vs the price increases at the average grocery.""Another ingredient (and one Fed chief Jay Powell could eat up) at play is inflation that is finally cooling.""There’s a line of sight to lower inflation/less margin pressure,"" Bank of America restaurant analyst Sara Senatore tells me of the appetite to own restaurant stocks in 2023So can these stocks continue to cook up the surprising gains?Maybe, but the second half headwinds will be almost as formidable as the first half, pros say. Chief among them is potentially a next leg down in economic growth and two more interest rate hikes from the Fed.""The group is heading into any potential slowdown in much better shape than perhaps any prior US recessions,"" one long-time restaurant analyst remarked to me.Somewhat reassuring.The pros think it's best to remain with best-in-breed names rather than bet on turnaround stories.""We believe that Yum! Brands and Wendy’s will continue to have positive momentum in the second half of the year, but we expect Chipotle and Darden to provide the greatest returns, as they directly operate their stores and can capture the upside from more moderate commodity inflation,"" Bernstein's Gargiulo says.Chew on that.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

48,81dc44d3-2f1d-3f86-b2d0-d98a9bd71ff4,MNST,2023-07-04,15 States with the Worst Job Markets,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-states-worst-job-markets-224810724.html,1688424490,STORY,"['WDAY', 'MNST']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 states with the worst job markets. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 states with the worst job markets.The United States of America actually closed the year 2022 by adding 223,000 jobs in December 2022 as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This meant a great deal for the economy of the country, helping it remain healthy despite the oncoming fears of recession. To find out the best state for economy, there are three values that are taken in consideration: the employment rate, job growth, and the labor force participation rate. Employment is considered as 1/3rd of the value for a good economic state. However, the question still is, is the job market good currently? The answer depends on where you live. Some states in the country have a great job market, with jobs continuously being added in sectors where there is a demand, providing great opportunities to the people dwelling in those states. On the other hand, other states in the United States of America are currently going through a rough time where finding a job is getting harder by the day. In those states, the starting salaries offered are quite low, and there is a poor possibility to find better opportunities as well. So even if you have the best skills and a great past working experience, you are still likely to end up unemployed in these states as they do not have enough options available to hire and fulfill that demand. The job market is also very specific to the professions and industries. While one sector maybe thriving, the rest might be suffering simultaneously. It has been a tough year for the USA, considering that inflation rates reached highs not seen in decades and the Federal Reserve also hiked interest rates to help calm the labor market. However, 2022 proved to be one of the lowest unemployment rates for the USA, though having a low unemployment rate is necessarily not a good thing. Unemployed includes everyone who does not have a job currently but are actively searching for one, and hence low unemployment rates make for a healthier economy. On the other hand, one reason for this could be a decline in the participation rate of labor in America. The labor participation rate is calculated as the percentage of civilians who are actively either working or in search of a job, and only those who are 16 or above are considered to be part of the labor pool. This is why it is also not considered the best of news, as companies then have to fight to find the best labor if the labor pool is very restricted, and this leads to higher costs faced by companies. It is a bittersweet symphony for the country, which is trying to stay afloat despite economic trends showing an upcoming state of recession globally.Story continues Technology companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) have also been hit by the doomed job market in USA. This led to a lot of people being laid off, and thus affected the trust and value that the ""metaverse"" initially had on people. After aggressive hiring during the pandemic, many companies had to cut down expenditure in order to make it through. However, some companies are still working hard in making sure that their companies survive and help the country's economic growth at a significant level. TikTok, a video hosting service platform, owned by a Chinese company ByteDance, announced a major hiring spree at the end of the year 2022, giving hope to the thousands of people laid off from tech companies. There are online business as well that are working in the recruiting industry allowing job seekers to seek jobs, such as Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY). Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY) is a company that specializes in cloud-based human capital management (HCM) software. Over the past year, its stock price has seen a significant rise of approximately 20%. This upward trend can be attributed to the robust growth of the HCM software market and Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY) consistent focus on innovation and the development of new products. Over the past five years, Workday Inc. has achieved an impressive annual revenue growth rate of 19%, allowing the company to showcase its consistent and substantial financial progress. Another such company is Monster Beverage Corporation Corp (NYSE: MNST), a global online employment marketplace. Its stock price has increased by about 10% over the past year. This is likely due to the strong growth of the online employment marketplace, as well as Monster Beverage Corporation Corp's (NYSE: MNST) acquisition of CareerBuilder in 2017.bank, banking, business, businessman, cash, cellphone, concept, corporate, currency, dollar, euro, financial, forex, horizontal, illustration, internet, invest, investing, investor, job, market, marketplace, men, money, network, office, phone, remotely, smart, smartphone, stock, suit, to go, touchscreen, trade, trader, trading, work, worker, workingCopyright: welcomia / 123RF Stock Photo“The lagged impact of aggressive Fed tightening, the drag on real wages from high inflation, and knock-on impacts from the downturn in Europe will drive the U.S. economy into recession territory next year – with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.7% at the end of 2023, and peaking at 5.3% in 2024,” said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. Regional Economics.  Employability consists of a set of skills, achievements, experience, that render a person good enough to be hired. It involves attributes that are more likely going to help someone get a job. So to look at this term from a macroeconomic outlook, a lack of employability will lead to unemployment and this adversely impact the labor's productivity. This will lead to a downward spiral in the gross domestic product per capita of the country and eventually lead to a decline in the standard of living as well. Hence, employability is essential to a healthy growth of a country's economy. As creating jobs help the economy, a bad job market leads to a decline in the state of the economy.MethodologyTo find out the 15 states with the worst job markets in 2022, we have used the statistics published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We used the unemployment rates rates in December 2022, and arranged them in ascending order. The highest unemployment rate stood at number 1 in the list.  Hence, we now take a look at the 15 states with the worst job markets in 2022.15. MississippiUnemployment Rate in Dec 2022: 4.7Total Unemployed: 50,208Even though Mississippi is actively working towards improving their unemployment rate, Mississippi has a relatively low educational attainment rate, which can make it more difficult for people to find good-paying jobs.14. DelawareUnemployment Rate in Dec 2022: 4.8Total Unemployed :21,710Delaware’s economy is heavily reliant on financial services. This industry was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to job losses in Delaware. Also, Delaware has a high cost of living. This can make it difficult for businesses to operate in the state, which can lead to job losses.13. TexasUnemployment Rate in Dec 2022: 4.8Total Unemployed: 571,199With an extremely high number of unemployed people, Texas is considered of the states with the worst job market. The Lone Star state has been under the heat for having low protection standards for the employees. With a decelerating nationwide growth, Texas could be in trouble if a recession hits the country, especially considering its high ranking among the states with the worst job markets.12. ConnecticutUnemployment Rate in Dec 2022: 5.1 Total Unemployed: 79,832In December 2022, Connecticut ended up losing 1,600 jobs, and is still struggling to recover the jobs lost during the pandemic. ""The Federal Reserve is attempting to slow the national economy to lower inflation, and Connecticut is participating in that slowdown as job growth slowed toward the end of the year,"" said  Patrick Flaherty, the states' Labor Department’s Director of Research. However, with a high unemployment rate and rising costs of living, Connecticut is definitely one of the states with the worst job market.11. IllinoisUnemployment Rate in Dec 2022: 5.1Total Unemployed: 303,217High taxes, high unemployment rates and a high number of unemployed people place Illinois number 11 on this list. Stagnant job growth and a large amount of missing jobs makes it hard for people to find good opportunities.10. MichiganUnemployment Rate in Dec 2022: 5.1Total Unemployed: 208,388Michigan is one of the states that have not been able to recover from the job losses that they suffered through the pandemic. They are still reeling from the adverse after effects of the economic shutdown in 2020. If this trend continues, there will be more job losses than gains for the state.9. New JerseyUnemployment Rate in Dec 2022: 5.1Total Unemployed: 162,539With a low average annual income and a high cost of living, it is no wonder New Jersey has one of the worst job markets. Here, the companies looking for people to hire are having a hard time filling up positions that are open, even through the constant distress of an upcoming recession.8. NevadaUnemployment Rate in Dec 2022: 5.2Total Unemployed: 80,470Nevada exhibits one of the highest unemployment rates in the United States of America and thus is considered one of the worst job markets in the country. With higher costs of living, people living in this state have to find higher paying jobs in order to be able to support their families through these rates. Most people are in a state of transition, trying to switch jobs, and shift from the leisure and hospitality sector as well. With inflation hitting them hard, gas prices on the rise, the job market is definitely suffering, and so is the economic condition of the state.7. MarylandUnemployment Rate in Dec 2022: 5.4Total Unemployed: 127,584Boasting an unemployment rate of 5.4 which is considered quite high, the Mid-Atlantic state finds itself at number 7 on this list of states with the worst job markets. However, upskilling might be able to help Maryland get their residents better employment opportunities.6. New YorkUnemployment Rate in Dec 2022: 5.4Total Unemployed: 412,333The unemployment rate of New York has suffered mainly because of COVID-19 and the industries that suffered and continue to do so are the ones that require in-person interactions such as hospitality, leisure, and construction. With unaffordable housing and slow job recovery, the job market in New York has taken a serious hit and it has become increasingly difficult for job seekers to find jobs.Click to continue reading and see the 5 states with the worst job markets.Suggested articles:15 Most Valuable Golf Companies in the World15 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks You Can Buy10 High Growth Dividend Paying Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 15 states with the worst job markets in 2022 is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

Airlines are expected to perform well in the June quarter, driven by increased passenger volumes and declining fuel costs.Given the current scenario of buoyant air-travel demand (both domestic and international), the Zacks Airline industry has been soaring high. Notably, the Zacks Airline industry has risen 36% so far this year, outperforming the 10.9% growth of the broader Zacks Transportation sector and 16.9% rise of the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPeople booking flights is leading to higher passenger revenues and contributing to most airlines’ top line. Driven by increased passenger revenues, the financial health of airlines has improved. We believe that the current summer season is likely to see a further surge in passenger revenues, in turn, aiding airlines’ top lines.Moreover, the lifting of restrictions under the CARES Act has allowed airline companies to initiate shareholder-friendly activities (like dividend payouts or share repurchases), highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.Given this encouraging backdrop, we present three airline stocks, Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL, American Airlines Group Inc. AAL and Southwest Airlines LUV, which have provided their updated second-quarter 2023 guidance.Each of these stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.All the abovementioned stocks have gained with respect to price in the year-to-date period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRevised Q2 ProjectionsDelta Air Lines’ management has issued a favorable outlook for the second quarter and full-year 2023 at the company’s Investor Day presentation. The company attributes this positive outlook to strong air-travel demand.For second-quarter 2023, Delta now expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.50 (prior view: $2-$2.25). Further, DAL now anticipates registering revenue growth between 17% and 18%, higher than the previous range of 15% to 17%. Operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be 16%.Story continuesFor 2023, Delta also raised its outlook. DAL now anticipates full-year adjusted earnings to be $6 per share, which aligns with the top end of its previous expectation in the $5-$6 range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings is currently pegged at $5.97 per share.DAL has also raised its revenue growth outlook to a range of 17% to 20% compared with the earlier forecast of 15% to 20% increase. In 2023, Delta now expects to generate free cash of $3 billion (prior view: $2 billion). The company now expects current-year operating margin at the top end of the 10-12% range expected previously.For fiscal 2024, the airline still expects EPS to exceed $7 and a free cash flow of more than $4 billion. It also foresees an operating margin of 13% to 15%.Driven by upbeat demand, American Airlines lifted its second-quarter EPS (excluding net special items) view in the $1.45-$1.65 range (earlier guidance: $1.20-$1.40). The adjusted operating margin is now anticipated in the 12.5-14.5% band (earlier guidance:11-13%). Average fuel cost per gallon is now expected in the range of $2.55-$2.65 (earlier guidance: $2.65-$2.75).AAL now expects total revenue per available seat miles (a measure of unit revenue) to decline 1%-3% from second-quarter 2022 actuals (the earlier estimate was for a 2-4% decline).Non-fuel unit costs are still expected to increase 3.5-5.5% year over year. Available seat miles (a measure of capacity) are still estimated to increase 3.5-5.5% year over year. For 2023, AAL has reinstated its outlook. Management still expects available seat miles to increase 5-8% year over year. Our model estimates an increase of 6.1% year over year. Non-fuel unit costs are still expected to increase 2-5% year over year. Our estimate hints at a 3.4% year-over-year increase.AAL still expects EPS (excluding net special items) in the $2.50-$3.50 range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.98.For second-quarter 2023, Southwest Airlines now expects revenue per available seat mile to be down 8-10% (prior view: down 8-11%). Capacity or available seat miles are still estimated to improve 14% from the year-ago reported figure.Economic fuel costs per gallon is now expected to be $2.55 (prior view: $2.45 - $2.55). LUV continues to expect consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 5-8% in the second quarter from the comparable period in 2022. Interest expenses are still expected to be $65 million in the second quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend capture strategy and performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best July Dividend Stocks To Buy. The investment landscape is undergoing substantial shifts this year as investors explore different strategies to make the most of the market rebound. Last year, investors loaded up on high-dividend stocks to generate regular income. However, this preference for dividend stocks has now somehow fallen out of favor. Ned Davis Research’s data shows that non-dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have gained approximately 18% in 2023, surpassing a roughly 4% increase seen by dividend-paying companies. The report also mentioned that around 400 companies in the index currently offer a dividend.That said, Ned Davis Research has also highlighted that dividend stocks typically exhibit strong performance when entering an economic slowdown. Therefore, there is a significant possibility for investors to refocus their attention on dividend stocks in the second half of this year as well. With worries of a potential recession still present, defensive companies, known for their substantial dividends, might once again outperform. This is because consumers tend to prioritize essential expenses like utility bills, household goods, and medical costs over discretionary purchases during an economic downturn. Paul Baiocchi, a chief ETF strategist at SS&amp;C ALPS Advisors, spoke with Wall Street Journal about the outlook of dividend stocks this year. He said:“The bulk of your total return from your stock market portfolio has come from compounded dividends over time, much more so than the actual price appreciation of the stock market. We don’t think that the first six months of 2023 has necessarily altered that overall outlook for dividends going forward.”Where the market has seen an increased interest in AI stocks, it also revealed that investors remain highly focused on generating income and achieving compounded growth. This emphasis was evident in the most recent quarter, as companies worldwide distributed a record-breaking amount of dividends. According to a report by Janus Henderson, during the first quarter of 2023, the largest 1,200 public companies globally distributed a total of $326.7 billion in dividends. This represents a 12% increase compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. The report also mentioned that the US accounted for nearly half of the corporate dividends distributed in Q1. The growth in dividends was primarily driven by the real estate, technology, and healthcare sectors. Some of the best dividend stocks that are grabbing investors’ attention include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).Story continuesAlso read: 10 Stocks that Paid Special Dividends in 2023Dividend Capture Strategy:Apart from investing in dividend-growing companies to generate consistent income, investors also employ a dividend capture strategy. This strategy involves buying shares of a company just before the ex-dividend date, which is the last day to own the stock and still be eligible to receive the upcoming dividend payment.

Strong cash flow generation capacity supports its shareholder-friendly activities.Let’s delve deeper to unearth the factors that make this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company a good investment option.Business Strength: Roper’s Application Software segment, which accounts for about 50% of total revenues, is benefiting from strength across its Deltek, Vertafore, Aderant and CliniSys businesses. Strength across enterprise-class customers, government contracting and private sector solutions is aiding Deltek, while record bookings and the adoption of SaaS models are key catalysts to Aderant’s growth. Vertafore, which is already going strong, is likely to get a boost from the recent acquisition of MGA Systems. Owing to growth in recurring revenues, the company expects mid-single-digit organic growth for the segment in 2023.The strong performance of freight-matching business is a key growth driver for the Network Software segment. Strength across the Foundry and iPipeline businesses is driving the unit’s growth. Strong bookings, retention and customer expansions are boosting the iPipeline business’ performance. ROP expects mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment in 2023.Strong momentum across the Neptune business due to increased demand for residential and commercial ultrasonic static meters is a key catalyst to the growth of the Tech-enabled Products segment. Strength across Verathon and Northern Digital business also supports growth of the Tech-enabled Products unit. With rising manufacturing productivity at Neptune and an improvement in the medical product businesses, the company anticipates low double-digit organic growth for the segment in the remainder of 2023.Bullish Guidance: With market conditions remaining strong, Roper’s bullish guidance for 2023 raises optimism in the stock. For 2023, the company expects total revenues to increase more than 12% year over year. Organic revenues are estimated to increase 6-7%. Adjusted earnings are predicted to be $16.10-$16.30 per share compared with $15.90-$16.20 expected earlier.Expansion Initiatives: Roper has been carrying out successive acquisitions to expand its operations. In October 2022, the company acquired Frontline Education for $3.7 billion. The acquisition builds on Roper’s Horizon software business (which it acquired in 2008), expanding its presence in the K-12 education market. It is expected to contribute approximately $370 million to Roper’s revenues and $175 million to its EBITDA in 2023. In January 2023, ROP acquired American LegalNet, strengthening its Aderant business. Acquisitions boosted sales by 8% in the first quarter. Shareholder-Friendly Activities: Roper’s commitment to reward its shareholders through dividends holds promise. In 2022, ROP paid dividends of $262.3 million, up 11% year over year. In the first quarter, the company paid dividends of $72.3 million, up 10.7% year over year. This can be linked to ROP’s strong cash flow generation capacity. In the first quarter, the company generated a free cash flow of $445 million, up 4% year over year. In November 2022, the company hiked its dividend by 10%. Northward Estimate Revision: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Roper’s 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 5 cents in the past 60 days.Price Performance: Due to the abovementioned tailwinds, shares of ROP have outperformed its industry in a year, gaining 20% compared with the industry’s 11.2% increase.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks within the Computers - IT Services industry are as follows:Vertiv Holdings Co.

This is a great time to be doing so. The stock market as a whole is enjoying a strong rally. And yet, there are still plenty of blue-chip stocks with high potential today. Investors might think that they have to give up the possibility of large capital gains to invest in safer conservative companies. But these seven best-value blue-chip stocks to buy offer upside at a good starting price. Morningstar agrees, with all seven of these picks being among their 4- or 5-star stocks today, suggesting they are on sale now.Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Danaher (DHR)a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocks, blue-chip stocks to buySource: ShutterstockOne of the top blue-chip stocks to buy is Danaher (NYSE:DHR), a healthcare company focused on laboratory tools and services.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat is a recent development, however, as Danaher began as an industrial conglomerate with a wide array of products. Over the years, management has been a whirlwind of mergers and acquisitions, deftly adding and divesting operations. It’s been so successful, in fact, that a $10,000 investment in Danaher shares in June 1993 would now be worth a stunning $1.73 million. Danaher hasn’t gotten complacent with its success. In fact, the firm is rapidly reinventing itself once again. It has already divested almost all of its slower-moving businesses, and the spin-off for its water business will conclude later this year.At that point, Danaher will be solely focused on healthcare, primarily on the tools and equipment needed for drug discovery. Analysts expect bioprocessing, in particular, to be a huge growth market over the next decade, and DHR stock will be a big beneficiary. Sales sold off as COVID-related sales have faded, however, that makes for a great entry point today.Becton, Dickinson (BDX)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockBecton, Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) is a leading medical devices company focused on surgical implements. Its core business is in making syringes, needles, infusion pumps, medication dispensers, and so on.Story continuesThese basic goods may seem like commodity products, but Becton, Dickinson has a major scale advantage due to its large size and durable relationships with hospitals, insurers, and other key players. And, like Danaher, it will naturally see revenues rise as the population ages and needs more surgeries and medical procedures.In recent years, Becton, Dickinson saw a surge in revenues related to temporary demand from COVID-19-related products. That has faded recently, and BDX stock has underperformed amid the slowdown. However, the company has reinvested profits into faster-growing device lines which should power growth in future years. Morningstar’s Alex Morozov sees shares as 16% undervalued today.Goldman Sachs (GS)blue chip definition highlightedSource: ShutterstockGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is not having a great year. Shares are down nearly 10% year-to-date. Some of that is due to the banking industry crisis, but people have been griping about Goldman’s performance in particular, as well.It’s true that operations slowed, particularly due to slow capital market conditions in 2022. Revenues from IPOs and merger advising naturally fell as the bear market reduced demand for capital markets services. Goldman is now aggressively cost-cutting to deal with the slowdown in deal activity.However, investors shouldn’t fret over this too much. For one thing, markets are already heating back up. We’ve seen high-profile IPOs such as the Cava (NYSE:CAVA) offering in recent weeks which should bring back demand for Goldman’s services.On the consumer side, Goldman should enjoy substantial growth in the coming years. For example, Goldman is the bank partner for Apple Card’s new high-yield savings program. This should bring in a ton of new deposits for Goldman to invest profitably from Apple’s loyal user base.With the recent pullback, GS stock is back under 10 times forward earnings and offers a 3.2% dividend yield.General Dynamics (GD)a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaperSource: ShutterstockGeneral Dynamics (NYSE:GD) is a leading defense contractor. It also has its Gulfstream commercial jet program.The defense sector has seen a rise in demand recently due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Rising geopolitical tensions in other parts of the world, such as in a potential dispute over Taiwan, are leading to rising spending on General Dynamics products.On the commercial side, Gulfstream produces top-notch long-range wide-body private jets. This segment has come roaring to life over the past few years amid a global surge in spending on luxury goods. The allure of private jets also grew in response to the pandemic as wealthy folks sought to avoid crowded commercial flights.GD stock dipped earlier this year around worries related to the debt ceiling. In theory, a budget impasse could have cut spending on the defense sector. That appears to have cleared up, however, GD stock remains cheap. Shares are down nearly 15% year-to-date, leaving them at less than 17 times forward earnings.Roper Technologies (ROP)Source: ShutterstockRoper Technologies (NYSE:ROP) is a leading conglomerate focused on industrial software. It operates software for a vast array of industries including but hardly limited to K-12 education, power plant management, insurance, animation and graphics, and food service. Roper may not be a household name. But it has a long track record of delivering growth and income for shareholders; it is a Dividend Aristocrat which has increased its annual payout for more than 25 years in a row.Roper shares are undervalued in general. And there is a specific catalyst on the horizon. The company just announced that it will be moving its primary listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq. This will be effective on July 6th. In doing so, Roper will become eligible for a number of new index funds, including ones tied to the influential Nasdaq 100 Index. This should lift ROP stock as a flood of passive money buys into Roper shares.Wells Fargo (WFC)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is one of the largest banks in America. With a well-diversified model, it has sizable operations in both investment and consumer banking. It’s also one of the largest mortgage originators in the country. Wells Fargo greatly underperformed its peers over the past five years. This came about in large part due to the company’s fake accounts scandals. However, it’s time to move on.The company has an entirely new management team now, including the highly respected Charles Scharf as CEO. It has settled most of the regulatory investigations stemming from those events. And Wells Fargo is now focused on cost-cutting as it gets back to normal operations.Wells Fargo is currently dealing with a dip in profits as its mortgage business sees less volume due to high-interest rates and it has reduced its efforts there. Even so, WFC stock is going for less than 9x forward earnings. And earnings should rise considerably once the economic cycle turns. WFC stock also offers a 3% dividend yield.General Motors (GM)the words ""blue chip"" in bold font overtop of a pile of cash. Blue-chip stocksSource: ShutterstockAccording to Morningstar’s analysts, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is one of the single most undervalued blue-chip stocks out there today. Their analysts assign a $78/share fair value to GM stock, as compared to its recent closing price of $36. This suggests GM stock is more than 50% undervalued today.What explains the deep undervaluation? It seems investors might be underappreciating General Motors’ advantages. The company has tremendous scale and has been quick to move into advancing fields such as electric vehicles and batteries. The firm’s financing business also gives it advantages in the marketplace.GE stock is currently selling for 5.4x forward earnings. This low valuation is understandable as investors fret about the potential negative impacts of higher interest rates and a potential recession on the auto market. However, if the economy holds up better than expected, GM shares could have tremendous upside.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in DHR, BDX, GS, GD, ROP, and WFC stock.

However, the company is also facing challenges due to weak demand in Europe and China.To address these challenges, PPG implemented a cost-cutting and restructuring strategy and optimized its working capital requirements. The company's restructuring initiatives are expected to generate significant cost savings, which will positively impact its financial performance. In the second quarter of 2023, the company anticipates incremental restructuring savings of $10-$15 million.To mitigate the impact of cost inflation in raw materials, energy and logistics, the company has been raising selling prices across its business segments. This pricing growth and improved manufacturing efficiencies and cost discipline, contributed to a significant increase in profits in the first quarter. The company expects these pricing measures to continue supporting its margins throughout the remainder of 2023.PPG is actively pursuing inorganic growth through value-creating acquisitions. Acquisitions such as Tikkurila, Worwag and Cetelon are expected to contribute to the company's top line in 2023.The company is committed to enhancing shareholder returns. In 2022, the company returned approximately $570 million to shareholders through dividends and $190 million through share repurchases. In the first quarter alone, dividends worth around $145 million were paid out.Estimates Going UpIn the last three months, the company witnessed a significant upward trend in its earnings estimates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's second-quarter EPS surged by approximately 31%, reflecting the growing optimism about its performance.

GS announced its capital plans that underline a 10% dividend increase beginning Jul 1, conditional on approval by its board of directors at the third-quarter meeting.Last year, after clearing the stress test, the company announced a 25% increase in the quarterly dividend in July 2022.Now, it plans to increase its common stock dividend from $2.50 per share to $2.75. This aside, GS announced a $30-billion common stock repurchase program in February 2023. In first-quarter 2023, 7.1 million shares were repurchased for $2.55 billion, with $27.45 in the remaining authorization under this plan. Such efforts not only reflect the company’s commitment to return value to the shareholders but also its healthy position to endure severe economic downturns.Notably, the stress test determined the firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) at 5.5%, resulting in a minimum Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) ratio requirement of 13%. This will become effective from Oct 1, 2023. The minimum Standardized CET1 ratio is lower than the prior year’s threshold of 13.3%. With a lower capital ratio requirement, a company typically has higher flexibility to deploy capital in share buybacks and dividends.Per management, “We are pleased by the progress we’ve made in reducing the capital intensity of our business as reflected in the stress test results. We will continue to dynamically manage our capital to unlock meaningful value for shareholders, including with a planned increase to our dividend and added flexibility in our capital repurchase program.”However, under the ‘severely adverse scenario,’ Goldman Sachs had the highest amount of estimated losses from commercial estate loans and credit cards. GS also had the highest projected loss under the ""global and exploratory market shock"" scenario.Shares of GS have declined 6.1%in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s fall of 9.6%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research GS currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other Banks With Enhanced Capital Deployment PlansSome other large U.S. banks, including JPMorgan JPM and Wells Fargo WFC, said on Friday that they would return more cash to shareholders after the clearance of the 2023 stress test.JPM, the largest U.S. bank, intends to raise the quarterly dividend by 5% to $1.05 per share.

But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) shareholders, since the share price is down 42% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 42%.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. Check out our latest analysis for Global Payments While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over the three years that the share price declined, Global Payments' earnings per share (EPS) dropped significantly, falling to a loss. This was, in part, due to extraordinary items impacting earnings. Due to the loss, it's not easy to use EPS as a reliable guide to the business. But it's safe to say we'd generally expect the share price to be lower as a result!The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Global Payments' earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Global Payments had a tough year, with a total loss of 10% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 16%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 2% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Global Payments  that you should be aware of.Story continuesIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 10.8% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 12.2%. McKesson’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 4.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcKesson is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its robust Biologics business. The optimism led by a solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and its strength in the distribution market are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trends persist.Let’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversStrength in Biologics: Investors are optimistic about McKesson’s robust Biologics business. Independent specialty pharmacy, Biologics by McKesson, has been making impressive progress lately. In April, the pharmacy was selected by Reata Pharmaceuticals as the sole specialty pharmacy provider for SKYCLARYS (omaveloxolone), the first and only treatment for Friedreich’s ataxia.In February, the pharmacy was selected by Lilly as a specialty pharmacy provider for JAYPIRCA (pirtobrutinib) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma after at least two lines of systemic therapy, including a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor.Strength in Distribution Market: McKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market, which raises investors’ optimism. The Distribution Solutions segment caters to a wide range of customers and businesses and stands to benefit from increased generic utilization, inflation in generics driven by several patent expirations in the next few years and an aging population.Story continuesPer the fiscal fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call in May, the company’s U.S. and international distribution businesses continued to play a key role in the pandemic response. Strong Q4 Results: McKesson’s robust fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy optimism. The company recorded robust top-line and bottom-line performances and strength in its U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments.DownsidesWeak Trends: McKesson distributes generic pharmaceuticals, which are subject to price fluctuation. The Distribution Solutions segment continues to experience weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trends. Continued volatility, unfavorable pricing trends, reimbursement of generic drugs and significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches could have a material adverse impact on McKesson.Stiff Competition: Distribution Solutions faces stiff competition both in terms of price and service from various full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large-payer organizations. Moreover, the company depends on fewer suppliers for its products. As a result, it is not in a position to negotiate pricing.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, HealthEquity, Inc.

The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 11.9% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 15.4%. Integer Holdings’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 1.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInteger Holdings is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its improving non-medical sales. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and its solid foothold in the broader MedTech space are expected to contribute further. However, dependence on third-party suppliers and stiff competition continues to concern the company.Let’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversImproving Non-Medical Sales: We are upbeat about Integer Holdings’ improvement in its Non-Medical sales. In the first quarter of 2023, revenues at the Non-Medical Sales segment rose 63.4% year over year. The upside was driven by strong sales at the Electrochem product line, part of the Non-Medical segment, across all market segments and continued supplier delivery recovery.Solid Foothold in the Broader MedTech Space: We are optimistic about Integer Holdings’ stable footing in the cardiac, neuromodulation, orthopedics, vascular and advanced surgical markets. Its primary customers include large, multi-national original equipment manufacturers and their affiliated subsidiaries.Integer Holdings has been focusing on its sales efforts to increase its market penetration in the Cardio &amp; Vascular, Neuromodulation and Non-Medical Electrochem markets. The company is also making strategic initiatives to maintain its leadership position in the cardiac rhythm management market.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: Integer Holdings’ robust first-quarter 2023 results raise our optimism. The company registered strong year-over-year top-line and bottom-line performances. Robust performances by both segments and strength in all three product lines of the Medical Sales segment were also recorded. The expansion of the adjusted operating margin bodes well for the stock.DownsidesStiff Competition: Competition with respect to the manufacturing of Integer Holdings’ medical products across all its product lines has intensified in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. The market for commercial power sources is competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid technological change. Many other commercial power source suppliers are larger than Integer Holdings and have greater resources, which may help them develop superior (technologically or otherwise) or more cost-effective products than the latter, thus resulting in lower revenues and operating results for Integer Holdings.Dependence on Third-Party Suppliers: Integer Holdings’ business depends on a continuous supply of raw materials, which may be susceptible to fluctuations due to transportation issues, government regulations and price controls, among others. Significant increases in the cost of raw materials, which cannot be recovered through increases in the prices of the company’s products, could adversely affect its operating results.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

It focuses on product launches to strengthen its business on a global scale. However, escalating costs and stiff competition are a concern.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has lost 10.5% compared with a 20.5% fall of the industry and a 18.4% increase of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned food and animal safety products provider has a market capitalization of $4.70 billion. The company’s fiscal third-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a remarkable 200%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayAnimal Safety Business Grows Well: Animal Safety revenues in the fiscal third quarter were up 1.9% year over year, consisting of 2.2% core growth. The core growth was led by the company’s portfolio of biosecurity products, driven largely by insect control share gains in the animal protein market.The company’s genomics business also performed well, with global core growth of 7.7%, led by volume increases in the global beef markets, partially offset by declines in testing in China caused by the continuation of COVID-related lab closures.Per management, the acquisitions of GVS and CAPInnoVet are part of Neogen’s strategy to expand companion animal offerings. The company’s acquisition of Delf UK Limited is expected to bolster its performance dairy chemicals offerings. Delf’s industrial cleaning products complement Neogen’s Quat-Chem disinfectant and cleaner offerings, enhancing its biosecurity portfolio.Food Safety Sales Growth Continues: Neogen continues to see rising revenues from the Food Safety business. For third-quarter fiscal 2023, Food Safety revenues surged 141.5% year over year, consisting of 5.8% core growth and 139.1% from acquisitions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe core growth was led by the Culture Media &amp; Other category, which benefited from a large order from a vaccine manufacturer. In the Bacterial &amp; General Sanitation product category, a solid increase in sales of Soleris spoilage detection products contributed to the growth.Story continuesProduct Launches: Neogen, of late, has been focusing on product launches to strengthen its business on a global scale.In March 2023, Neogen announced that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved additional virucide claims to its Neogen Viroxide Super disinfectant. These label claims specify that Neogen Viroxide Super kills viruses on hard non-porous surfaces that cause Avian Influenza A, Bovine Viral Diarrhea, Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome (PRRS), and African Swine Fever.In November 2022, Neogen introduced an upgraded version of its best-selling Ideal D3 detectable needles, designed to be six times more detectable than the conventional and stainless-steel needles.DownsidesMounting Operating Expenses:  In the fiscal third quarter, Negen’s sales and marketing expenses rose 79.7%, whereas administrative expenses rose 85.7% from the prior-year quarter’s levels. Research &amp; development expenses were up 59.1% year over year. Operating costs increased 80.8% from the last year’s quarter.Competitive Landscape Tough: Neogen faces intense competition from small businesses to divisions of large multinational companies. Some of these organizations have greater financial resources. NEOG faced intense competition from the development of new technologies by the company’s competitor, which could affect the marketability and profitability of Neogen’s products.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Neogen’s earnings for 2023 has moved 11.1% north to 50 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $807.9 million, suggesting a 53.3% rise from the 2022 reported number.Other Key PicksA few top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The Spine and Dental business spin-off is part of the company’s portfolio transformation focused on getting more revenues in faster growth markets.Of late, Zimmer Biomet has been strengthening its foothold within emerging markets that provide long-term opportunities for growth. However, escalated expenses and a competitive landscape pose challenges for ZBH.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has increased 35.8% against the 21.6% fall of the industry and the 16.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The leading musculoskeletal healthcare company has a market capitalization of $30.37 billion. The company has an earnings yield of 5.12% against the industry’s -2.25%. Zimmer Biomet surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average earnings surprise of 7.38%.Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsBusiness Recovery Continues: In the last reported quarter, ZBH’s domestic sales were well ahead of the company’s expectations, with elective procedure volumes recovering and procedure cancellation rates returning to pre-pandemic levels. Internationally, sales across the EMEA region were driven by faster recovery and strength across developed and emerging markets.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn terms of product category, global knees witnessed a strong uptake across the full Persona product portfolio and sales traction in all regions. Global hips’ performance demonstrated continued traction across the Avenir and G7 product lines, along with the ongoing uptake of Rosa hip. The S.E.T. (sports extremities and trauma)category was impacted by the continued strong performance across its key focus areas of CMFT, sports medicines and upper extremities.Dental and Spine Spin-off to Bode Well: Zimmer Biomet recently completed its planned spin-off procedure of the dental &amp; spine arm as part of the company’s third phase of the ongoing transformation.Story continuesThe transaction represents an important step in ZBH’s transition to a more streamlined company with a greater focus on optimized resource allocation, including innovations in profitable core businesses and attractive markets with opportunities to become market leaders.A Focus on Emerging Markets: The company’s strategic investments in emerging markets over the past several quarters to improve operational and sales performance are yielding results. Following the integration of Biomet, the S.E.T business is expected to move forward, due to a strong presence in these regions with an extended portfolio that includes upper and lower joints.Within emerging markets, we note that the strength of the Asia Pacific market has continued to drive strong revenue growth so far. ZBH is expected to continue with this trend post the COVID-19 mayhem, banking on a cadence of product launches and strong customer adoptions.DownsidesQ1 Negatives: The company continued to face significant challenges in terms of unfavorable foreign exchange, supply, inflation and staffing shortage. Reimbursement headwinds in the U.S. restorative therapies are another downside. In APAC, the company saw some pressure on China as anticipated. Meanwhile, mounting expenses are putting pressure on margins.A Competitive Landscape: The medical device market is intensely competitive. The orthopedic industry, in particular, is comprised of players like Stryker, Johnson &amp; Johnson's DePuy, Smith &amp; Nephew and Medtronic. ZBH needs to constantly introduce or acquire new products to withstand competitive pressure and maintain its market share.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Zimmer Biomet’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at $7.45 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $7.33 billion.

The extension could continue beyond next month, the Gulf state said.Meanwhile, Russian deputy prime minister Alexander Novak stated that Moscow will slash oil exports by 500,000 barrels a day next month.The combined cuts account for 1.5% of global supply and raise the total promised by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to 5.16M barrels a day.As of 09:57 ET (13:57 GMT), oil prices had retreated from earlier gains as the prospect of tightening supplies was partly offset by concerns over how further potential Federal Reserve interest rate increases could impact demand.Shares in Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) edged higher in the wake of the announcements.

Earnings per share also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.09 by a margin of 30.1%.CALM has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 20.5%, on average.CalMaine’s revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 had surged 109% year over year to $997.5 million. This was driven by significantly higher market prices and favorable demand boosted by the busy holiday season.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings per share for CALM is pegged at $1.38. The estimate has plunged 57% over the past 30 days. The consensus mark indicates a year-over-year decline of 39%.Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. Quote Factors at PlayCalMaine Food’s results in the last reported quarter had benefited from significantly higher average selling prices for conventional eggs, primarily due to fears of reduced supply, stemming from the outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza in the United States in 2022. Volumes had been strong due to solid customer demand.However, egg prices reversed course this year declining 10.9% sequentially in March, 1.5% in April and 13.8% in May, per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This was mainly due to a recovery in egg production amid weaker consumer demand. This is expected to reflect on CalMaine Food’s top-line performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.Farm production costs have been high mainly due to elevated feed costs. This is also likely to have weighed on margins in the quarter under review. Nevertheless, the company’s ongoing focus on cost control is likely to have helped counter some of this impact.Story continuesWhat Our Zacks Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for CalMaine Foods this time around.

Boehringer Ingelheim and Swiss drugmaker Sandoz launched their Humira biosimilars on Saturday.Biocon Biologics, a unit of Biocon, said Hulio would be available at a list price of 5% below Humira's current list price. Humira comes at list price of $6,922 per carton. The biosimilar would also be available under another plan at a list price of about 85% below that of Humira.Unlike pills, which have extremely cheap generic copies, complex, expensive biologic drugs made from living cells cannot be exactly duplicated. Their closest alternatives are called biosimilars.Amgen launched the first Humira biosimilar for the U.S. in January at 5% and 55% discounts to the branded medicine, depending on the buyer.Lower discount plans usually are more attractive to pharmacy benefit managers, who act as middlemen between insurers and drugmakers, as they come with more rebates from the pharmaceutical companies.Although prices usually fall when generic versions of a widely used medication enter the market, manufacturers of Humira biosimilars are likely to keep prices high to compete with one another for leverage with pharmacy benefit managers, experts have said.AbbVie has forecast a 37% drop in Humira sales in 2023 due to competition. Until recently, it was the world's biggest-selling non-COVID prescription drug, hitting a record $21.2 billion in sales for 2022.

Valued at $92.5 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Jun 28, 2024.The deal has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Arsenal, IL.What’s Favoring BAE Systems?The rise in security threats and the changing dynamics of the defense world have led to increased defense spending by nations on ordnance, ammunition and arms. In this context, defense spending on propellant grain, widely used in firearms, artillery or rocket propulsion systems mainly to provide pressure and gas volumes for projectile propulsion, has increased manifold.Per the report from the Markets and Markets firm, the ammunition market is poised to witness a CAGR of 3.7% over the 2021-2026 period.This stands to benefit BAE Systems as its Ordnance Systems business unit excels in manufacturing a full range of high-quality explosive and propellant products for the military. This results in multiple order inflows for the company, like the latest one, which is likely to boost its revenues from the Ordnance Systems business unit.Peers in FocusThe expanding size of the ammunition market may provide meaningful gains for other defense majors in the industry:General Dynamics GD: Its Ordnance and Tactical Systems (“OTS”) has a long legacy of producing high-quality ammunition. OTS’ munitions manufacture Hydra-70 rockets, bomb bodies, large-caliber tank ammunition, medium-caliber ammunition, military propellants, mortar and artillery projectiles.General Dynamics has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.9%.

82,0e5d09a1-df14-3b7d-be23-abd075386438,GD,2023-07-04,The 7 Most Undervalued Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Now: June 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-most-undervalued-blue-chip-004053226.html,1687912853,STORY,"['DHR', 'GSBD', 'WFC', 'ROP', 'BDX', 'GD']","[Looking for undervalued blue-chip stocks to buy? This is a great time to be doing so. The stock market as a whole is enjoying a strong rally. And yet, there are still plenty of blue-chip stocks with high potential today. Investors might think that they have to give up the possibility of large capital gains to invest in safer conservative companies. But these seven best-value blue-chip stocks to buy offer upside at a good starting price. Morningstar agrees, with all seven of these picks being among their 4- or 5-star stocks today, suggesting they are on sale now.Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Danaher (DHR)a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocks, blue-chip stocks to buySource: ShutterstockOne of the top blue-chip stocks to buy is Danaher (NYSE:DHR), a healthcare company focused on laboratory tools and services.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat is a recent development, however, as Danaher began as an industrial conglomerate with a wide array of products. Over the years, management has been a whirlwind of mergers and acquisitions, deftly adding and divesting operations. It’s been so successful, in fact, that a $10,000 investment in Danaher shares in June 1993 would now be worth a stunning $1.73 million. Danaher hasn’t gotten complacent with its success. In fact, the firm is rapidly reinventing itself once again. It has already divested almost all of its slower-moving businesses, and the spin-off for its water business will conclude later this year.At that point, Danaher will be solely focused on healthcare, primarily on the tools and equipment needed for drug discovery. Analysts expect bioprocessing, in particular, to be a huge growth market over the next decade, and DHR stock will be a big beneficiary. Sales sold off as COVID-related sales have faded, however, that makes for a great entry point today.Becton, Dickinson (BDX)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockBecton, Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) is a leading medical devices company focused on surgical implements. Its core business is in making syringes, needles, infusion pumps, medication dispensers, and so on.Story continuesThese basic goods may seem like commodity products, but Becton, Dickinson has a major scale advantage due to its large size and durable relationships with hospitals, insurers, and other key players. And, like Danaher, it will naturally see revenues rise as the population ages and needs more surgeries and medical procedures.In recent years, Becton, Dickinson saw a surge in revenues related to temporary demand from COVID-19-related products. That has faded recently, and BDX stock has underperformed amid the slowdown. However, the company has reinvested profits into faster-growing device lines which should power growth in future years. Morningstar’s Alex Morozov sees shares as 16% undervalued today.Goldman Sachs (GS)blue chip definition highlightedSource: ShutterstockGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is not having a great year. Shares are down nearly 10% year-to-date. Some of that is due to the banking industry crisis, but people have been griping about Goldman’s performance in particular, as well.It’s true that operations slowed, particularly due to slow capital market conditions in 2022. Revenues from IPOs and merger advising naturally fell as the bear market reduced demand for capital markets services. Goldman is now aggressively cost-cutting to deal with the slowdown in deal activity.However, investors shouldn’t fret over this too much. For one thing, markets are already heating back up. We’ve seen high-profile IPOs such as the Cava (NYSE:CAVA) offering in recent weeks which should bring back demand for Goldman’s services.On the consumer side, Goldman should enjoy substantial growth in the coming years. For example, Goldman is the bank partner for Apple Card’s new high-yield savings program. This should bring in a ton of new deposits for Goldman to invest profitably from Apple’s loyal user base.With the recent pullback, GS stock is back under 10 times forward earnings and offers a 3.2% dividend yield.General Dynamics (GD)a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaperSource: ShutterstockGeneral Dynamics (NYSE:GD) is a leading defense contractor. It also has its Gulfstream commercial jet program.The defense sector has seen a rise in demand recently due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Rising geopolitical tensions in other parts of the world, such as in a potential dispute over Taiwan, are leading to rising spending on General Dynamics products.On the commercial side, Gulfstream produces top-notch long-range wide-body private jets. This segment has come roaring to life over the past few years amid a global surge in spending on luxury goods. The allure of private jets also grew in response to the pandemic as wealthy folks sought to avoid crowded commercial flights.GD stock dipped earlier this year around worries related to the debt ceiling. In theory, a budget impasse could have cut spending on the defense sector. That appears to have cleared up, however, GD stock remains cheap. Shares are down nearly 15% year-to-date, leaving them at less than 17 times forward earnings.Roper Technologies (ROP)Source: ShutterstockRoper Technologies (NYSE:ROP) is a leading conglomerate focused on industrial software. It operates software for a vast array of industries including but hardly limited to K-12 education, power plant management, insurance, animation and graphics, and food service. Roper may not be a household name. But it has a long track record of delivering growth and income for shareholders; it is a Dividend Aristocrat which has increased its annual payout for more than 25 years in a row.Roper shares are undervalued in general. And there is a specific catalyst on the horizon. The company just announced that it will be moving its primary listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq. This will be effective on July 6th. In doing so, Roper will become eligible for a number of new index funds, including ones tied to the influential Nasdaq 100 Index. This should lift ROP stock as a flood of passive money buys into Roper shares.Wells Fargo (WFC)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is one of the largest banks in America. With a well-diversified model, it has sizable operations in both investment and consumer banking. It’s also one of the largest mortgage originators in the country. Wells Fargo greatly underperformed its peers over the past five years. This came about in large part due to the company’s fake accounts scandals. However, it’s time to move on.The company has an entirely new management team now, including the highly respected Charles Scharf as CEO. It has settled most of the regulatory investigations stemming from those events. And Wells Fargo is now focused on cost-cutting as it gets back to normal operations.Wells Fargo is currently dealing with a dip in profits as its mortgage business sees less volume due to high-interest rates and it has reduced its efforts there. Even so, WFC stock is going for less than 9x forward earnings. And earnings should rise considerably once the economic cycle turns. WFC stock also offers a 3% dividend yield.General Motors (GM)the words ""blue chip"" in bold font overtop of a pile of cash. Blue-chip stocksSource: ShutterstockAccording to Morningstar’s analysts, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is one of the single most undervalued blue-chip stocks out there today. Their analysts assign a $78/share fair value to GM stock, as compared to its recent closing price of $36. This suggests GM stock is more than 50% undervalued today.What explains the deep undervaluation? It seems investors might be underappreciating General Motors’ advantages. The company has tremendous scale and has been quick to move into advancing fields such as electric vehicles and batteries. The firm’s financing business also gives it advantages in the marketplace.GE stock is currently selling for 5.4x forward earnings. This low valuation is understandable as investors fret about the potential negative impacts of higher interest rates and a potential recession on the auto market. However, if the economy holds up better than expected, GM shares could have tremendous upside.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in DHR, BDX, GS, GD, ROP, and WFC stock.

86,78f4af33-62da-3b41-a433-143c1dc9ba97,PDCO,2023-07-04,5 Best PEG-Driven GARP Stocks for Investors,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-best-peg-driven-garp-124100172.html,1688388060,STORY,"['NXST', 'PDCO', 'TOL', 'GEF-B']","[The investing track of the Oracle of Omaha over the past few decades shows a gradual shift from being a pure-play value investor to a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) investor. The logic behind this is the effectiveness of a mixed investment strategy over pure-play, value or growth approaches of investments.Several stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, show an overwhelming success of this hybrid investing strategy over pure-play value and growth investments. Here we will discuss the success of five such stocks. These include Toll Brothers TOL, Patterson Companies PDCO, Greif GEF, Nexstar Media Group NXST and Afya AFYA.A Few More Words on GARPThe GARP theory enables the strategic mingling of growth and value-investing principles, which gives us a hybrid strategy by utilizing the best features of both. What GARPers look for is whether or not the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics — the price/earnings growth (PEG) ratio. Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks’ P/E ratio with the future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives an idea of stocks that are trading at a discount, PEG, while adding the growth element to it, helps to identify stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock's P/E ratio is 10 and the expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company's PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio that indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.However, the question that often arises is whether the market has an adequate number of companies that are growing earnings while trading at reasonable valuations? Going by a CFA Institute Blog by Nicolas Rabener, “on average, 38% of all stocks exhibit a PEG ratio below 1, which is more than enough for security selection.”Story continuesUnfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitations in calculating the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It does not consider the common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purposes)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $800 Million (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20-day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential.Here are five out of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Toll Brothers: Based in Horsham, PA, TOL builds single-family detached and attached home communities; master planned luxury residential resort-style golf communities; and urban low, mid, and high-rise communities, principally on the land it develops and improves.Toll Brothers is an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of B. Apart from a discounted PEG and P/E, it also has an impressive long-term historical growth rate of 23.9%.Patterson: St. Paul, MN-headquartered PDCO is one of the leading distributors of dental and animal health products. Patterson currently operates through three segments — Dental, Animal Health and Corporate. A broad product spectrum and huge prospects in animal and dental markets raise investors’ optimism for Patterson.Patterson can also be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of A. Apart from a discounted PEG and P/E, the stock has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 9.2%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Greif: Delaware, OH-based GEF is a leading global producer of industrial packaging products and services with manufacturing facilities located in more than 40 countries. It offers a comprehensive line of rigid industrial packaging products and containerboard and corrugated products for niche markets in North America. It is also a leading global producer of flexible intermediate bulk containers.Greif has an impressive long-term historical growth rate of 21.2%.

Nexstar owns America’s largest local broadcasting group.Nexstar has an impressive long-term historical growth rate of 35.3%.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend capture strategy and performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best July Dividend Stocks To Buy. The investment landscape is undergoing substantial shifts this year as investors explore different strategies to make the most of the market rebound. Last year, investors loaded up on high-dividend stocks to generate regular income. However, this preference for dividend stocks has now somehow fallen out of favor. Ned Davis Research’s data shows that non-dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have gained approximately 18% in 2023, surpassing a roughly 4% increase seen by dividend-paying companies. The report also mentioned that around 400 companies in the index currently offer a dividend.That said, Ned Davis Research has also highlighted that dividend stocks typically exhibit strong performance when entering an economic slowdown. Therefore, there is a significant possibility for investors to refocus their attention on dividend stocks in the second half of this year as well. With worries of a potential recession still present, defensive companies, known for their substantial dividends, might once again outperform. This is because consumers tend to prioritize essential expenses like utility bills, household goods, and medical costs over discretionary purchases during an economic downturn. Paul Baiocchi, a chief ETF strategist at SS&amp;C ALPS Advisors, spoke with Wall Street Journal about the outlook of dividend stocks this year. He said:“The bulk of your total return from your stock market portfolio has come from compounded dividends over time, much more so than the actual price appreciation of the stock market. We don’t think that the first six months of 2023 has necessarily altered that overall outlook for dividends going forward.”Where the market has seen an increased interest in AI stocks, it also revealed that investors remain highly focused on generating income and achieving compounded growth. This emphasis was evident in the most recent quarter, as companies worldwide distributed a record-breaking amount of dividends. According to a report by Janus Henderson, during the first quarter of 2023, the largest 1,200 public companies globally distributed a total of $326.7 billion in dividends. This represents a 12% increase compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. The report also mentioned that the US accounted for nearly half of the corporate dividends distributed in Q1. The growth in dividends was primarily driven by the real estate, technology, and healthcare sectors. Some of the best dividend stocks that are grabbing investors’ attention include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).Story continuesAlso read: 10 Stocks that Paid Special Dividends in 2023Dividend Capture Strategy:Apart from investing in dividend-growing companies to generate consistent income, investors also employ a dividend capture strategy.

Valued at $92.5 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Jun 28, 2024.The deal has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Arsenal, IL.What’s Favoring BAE Systems?The rise in security threats and the changing dynamics of the defense world have led to increased defense spending by nations on ordnance, ammunition and arms. In this context, defense spending on propellant grain, widely used in firearms, artillery or rocket propulsion systems mainly to provide pressure and gas volumes for projectile propulsion, has increased manifold.Per the report from the Markets and Markets firm, the ammunition market is poised to witness a CAGR of 3.7% over the 2021-2026 period.This stands to benefit BAE Systems as its Ordnance Systems business unit excels in manufacturing a full range of high-quality explosive and propellant products for the military. This results in multiple order inflows for the company, like the latest one, which is likely to boost its revenues from the Ordnance Systems business unit.Peers in FocusThe expanding size of the ammunition market may provide meaningful gains for other defense majors in the industry:General Dynamics GD: Its Ordnance and Tactical Systems (“OTS”) has a long legacy of producing high-quality ammunition. OTS’ munitions manufacture Hydra-70 rockets, bomb bodies, large-caliber tank ammunition, medium-caliber ammunition, military propellants, mortar and artillery projectiles.General Dynamics has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.9%.

F117 engines are equipped with a directed-flow thrust reverser capable of being deployed in flight.Its reduced temperature configuration uses technical and material advancements, such as second-generation single-crystal turbine materials, improved cooling management and thermal barrier coatings to lower operating temperatures. These enhancements contribute to F117’s excellent reliability, durability and long time on wing.Buoyed by such remarkable features, one may expect F117 to continue to serve and power the C-17 Globemaster III, which should result in RTX witnessing a strong inflow of orders and support services contracts, like the latest one. This must bolster Raytheon’s revenues from the Pratt &amp; Whitney business unit.Growth ProspectsNations are continuously strengthening their warfare and defense capabilities. In this context, warfare activities like effective airlift missions along with any kind of humanitarian aid or an overnight combat airdrop in an unsecured location that forms part of military abilities can only be carried out through an effective aircraft driven by a powerful engine.Per the reports from Dataintelo, the global military aircraft engine market is expected to witness a CAGR of 5.3% from 2022 to 2030. This unfolds huge opportunities for Pratt &amp; Whitney as it is a forerunner in designing, manufacturing and servicing aircraft engines and auxiliary power units.Story continuesPratt &amp; Whitney-manufactured engines power a series of military aircraft that enjoy strong demand in the combat aircraft market and thus should benefit RTX.

An ABR of 1.67 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 66.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PHMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PHMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PulteGroup here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying PulteGroup, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is PHM Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for PulteGroup, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.9% over the past month to $9.30.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for PulteGroup. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for PulteGroup may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend capture strategy and performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best July Dividend Stocks To Buy. The investment landscape is undergoing substantial shifts this year as investors explore different strategies to make the most of the market rebound. Last year, investors loaded up on high-dividend stocks to generate regular income. However, this preference for dividend stocks has now somehow fallen out of favor. Ned Davis Research’s data shows that non-dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have gained approximately 18% in 2023, surpassing a roughly 4% increase seen by dividend-paying companies. The report also mentioned that around 400 companies in the index currently offer a dividend.That said, Ned Davis Research has also highlighted that dividend stocks typically exhibit strong performance when entering an economic slowdown. Therefore, there is a significant possibility for investors to refocus their attention on dividend stocks in the second half of this year as well. With worries of a potential recession still present, defensive companies, known for their substantial dividends, might once again outperform. This is because consumers tend to prioritize essential expenses like utility bills, household goods, and medical costs over discretionary purchases during an economic downturn. Paul Baiocchi, a chief ETF strategist at SS&amp;C ALPS Advisors, spoke with Wall Street Journal about the outlook of dividend stocks this year. He said:“The bulk of your total return from your stock market portfolio has come from compounded dividends over time, much more so than the actual price appreciation of the stock market. We don’t think that the first six months of 2023 has necessarily altered that overall outlook for dividends going forward.”Where the market has seen an increased interest in AI stocks, it also revealed that investors remain highly focused on generating income and achieving compounded growth. This emphasis was evident in the most recent quarter, as companies worldwide distributed a record-breaking amount of dividends. According to a report by Janus Henderson, during the first quarter of 2023, the largest 1,200 public companies globally distributed a total of $326.7 billion in dividends. This represents a 12% increase compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. The report also mentioned that the US accounted for nearly half of the corporate dividends distributed in Q1. The growth in dividends was primarily driven by the real estate, technology, and healthcare sectors. Some of the best dividend stocks that are grabbing investors’ attention include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).Story continuesAlso read: 10 Stocks that Paid Special Dividends in 2023Dividend Capture Strategy:Apart from investing in dividend-growing companies to generate consistent income, investors also employ a dividend capture strategy. This strategy involves buying shares of a company just before the ex-dividend date, which is the last day to own the stock and still be eligible to receive the upcoming dividend payment.

With 65% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Johnson &amp; Johnson. View our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Johnson &amp; Johnson?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Johnson &amp; Johnson. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Johnson &amp; Johnson's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Johnson &amp; Johnson. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.8% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.2% and 5.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Johnson &amp; JohnsonThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Johnson &amp; Johnson in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$374m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 35% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Johnson &amp; Johnson. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Safe mainstays like short-term Treasury Bills and high-yield savings accounting generate decent returns for the first in years. Still, some investors want to avoid broad market volatility and shy away from tech and growth stocks but want to squeeze a few more basis points from their investment.Dividend stocks, for many, are the answer. The S&amp;P 500’s Dividend Aristocrats index returned more than 8.5% since the beginning of the year, almost doubling even the highest high-yield savings accounts with fewer price swings than the overall market.The dividend yield isn’t the final say in income investing strategies, though. Investors often dig a bit further below the surface to uncover the company’s payout ratio. This metric, calculated as the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends, provides a more complete picture than just the dividend yield. It helps income-focused investors gauge whether a company can maintain or increase its dividends over time, ensuring a reliable income stream – ultimately prizing longevity alongside cash flow.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMedtronic (MDT)Source: ShutterstockPayout Ratio: 96%Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) is a global medical service mainstay firmly entrenched within its industry while still pushing forward with new innovative techniques, including artificial intelligence applications in healthcare.Medtronic took a beating alongside most healthcare stocks post-pandemic, but the company’s payout philosophy is beyond reproach. The company consistently raised its annual dividend for almost half a century, and the company’s CFO reassured investors that Medtronic plans to distribute a minimum of 50% of its free cash flow to shareholders through 2023.Beyond its dividend strategy, Medtronic’s reputation as a pioneering force in medical device innovation adds to its allure. By fostering collaborations with hospital networks through risk-based contracting, it is carving a path for improved patient outcomes and cost reduction. As healthcare delivery becomes increasingly costly, Medtronic’s proposition makes it an appealing ally for many institutions. This and other strategic moves, paired with a high payout ratio and emphasis on returning value shareholders, make Medtronic a high dividend stock dream.Story continuesEdison International (EIX)Southern California Edison sign and logo EIX stockSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comPayout Ratio: 131%Utility companies often attract dividend investors due to their stable customer base, dependable financials, and limited growth prospects leading to profit redistribution to shareholders.Still, among peers, Edison International (NYSE:EIX) stands apart.Viewed through a value lens, Edison surpasses industry dividend averages by nearly 2%, having consistently grown its annual yield for the last 19 years, including a planned 5.4% hike for 2023. In 2023 its stock price, after hitting a low in October 2022, climbed impressively, outpacing industry averages by a significant margin. But numbers are just part of the equation.Based in California, Edison faces greater state regulatory obstacles than its counterparts. However, this could prove advantageous given California’s unique approach to energy and climate management.The spreading ban on natural gas and heightened demand for green energy practices across the state position Edison as one of the rare utility firms with tangible expansion plans. Despite its current focus on southern California, the growing preference for sustainability in the north suggests Edison’s potential to grow in parallel with California’s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2045.Quality growth prospects, decent dividend yield, and a staggeringly-high payout ratio make Edison International among the easiest dividend stocks to pick for income investment strategies.McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.Source: Tama2u / ShutterstockPayout Ratio: 62%McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) likely needs no introduction to American (or global) consumers, but many investors overlook its dividend and income investing value.From a value investor perspective, McDonald’s is a mature mainstay with an unbeatable market presence. It operates 38,000 locations in over 100 countries, giving investors geographic diversification, scaled operations, and a reliable cash flow. Additionally, the company’s robust balance sheet and iconic brand give it an undeniable competitive advantage that stops new entrants in their tracks. Furthermore, McDonald’s embraces technological advances and initiatives, continuing its focus on digital and delivery capabilities. These combine to show it’s adapting to changing consumer habits, indicating potential future growth.For income investors, McDonald’s has a long history of paying and growing dividends. It is a part of the esteemed group of Dividend Aristocrats, which have increased dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. McDonald’s has increased its dividend for almost 50 consecutive years, displaying a strong commitment to return capital to shareholders. This consistent and growing income stream is ideal for those demanding income alongside stability in their dividend stock portfolio.On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held long positions in MDT and EIX.

However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Rockwell Automation, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$1.5b ÷ (US$11b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Rockwell Automation has an ROCE of 19%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 11% generated by the Electrical industry. Check out our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Rockwell Automation compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Rockwell Automation here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?In terms of Rockwell Automation's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 24% over the last five years. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.Story continuesIn Conclusion...While returns have fallen for Rockwell Automation in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. And long term investors must be optimistic going forward because the stock has returned a huge 112% to shareholders in the last five years. So should these growth trends continue, we'd be optimistic on the stock going forward.One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Rockwell Automation and understanding this should be part of your investment process.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Tinker AFB, OK, has awarded the deal.Valued at $5.5 billion, per this contract, Raytheon will provide sustainment support services for the F117 engine. The work is scheduled to be completed by Sep 30, 2027.Importance of the F117 EnginePratt &amp; Whitney’s F117 is the exclusive power for the U.S. Air Force’s advanced transport, the C-17 Globemaster III strategic transport aircraft. F117 engines are equipped with a directed-flow thrust reverser capable of being deployed in flight.Its reduced temperature configuration uses technical and material advancements, such as second-generation single-crystal turbine materials, improved cooling management and thermal barrier coatings to lower operating temperatures. These enhancements contribute to F117’s excellent reliability, durability and long time on wing.Buoyed by such remarkable features, one may expect F117 to continue to serve and power the C-17 Globemaster III, which should result in RTX witnessing a strong inflow of orders and support services contracts, like the latest one. This must bolster Raytheon’s revenues from the Pratt &amp; Whitney business unit.Growth ProspectsNations are continuously strengthening their warfare and defense capabilities. In this context, warfare activities like effective airlift missions along with any kind of humanitarian aid or an overnight combat airdrop in an unsecured location that forms part of military abilities can only be carried out through an effective aircraft driven by a powerful engine.Per the reports from Dataintelo, the global military aircraft engine market is expected to witness a CAGR of 5.3% from 2022 to 2030. This unfolds huge opportunities for Pratt &amp; Whitney as it is a forerunner in designing, manufacturing and servicing aircraft engines and auxiliary power units.Story continuesPratt &amp; Whitney-manufactured engines power a series of military aircraft that enjoy strong demand in the combat aircraft market and thus should benefit RTX. Some of them are discussed below:Boeing BA: Its B-52 bomber jet continues to be a critical contributor to the U.S. National Security Strategy and is powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney’s TF33 engine. Another aircraft of the company powered by RTX’s TF33 engine is the E-3 Airborne Warning and Control Systems aircraft.Boeing has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%. Its investors have gained 51% in the past year.Lockheed Martin LMT: Pratt &amp; Whitney’s F135, the most powerful and most advanced fighter engine ever produced, powers LMT’s F35 aircraft. The stealth aircraft enjoys strong demand worldwide, which propels the demand for F135 engines and benefits Raytheon.Lockheed Martin’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.2%. Shares of LMT have returned 6.2% value to investors in the past year.Price MovementIn the past month, shares of Raytheon Technologies have increased 2.3% compared with the industry’s growth of 6.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankRaytheon Technologies currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Primarily, we all know that digital intelligence commands significant attention. According to Grand View Research, the global AI market size reached $136.55 billion last year.Even better, analysts in the field project that the sector will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030. By the culmination of the forecast period, the industry should hit revenue of over $1.81 trillion. Again, though, you don’t have to pay full retail, which brings us to the best value AI stocks to buy.Fundamentally, with so many people chasing the flavors of the week, certain enterprises have become significantly overpriced. At the same time, some enterprises have become less appreciated than they deserve. Therefore, investors should target these top undervalued AI stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSkyworks Solutions (SWKS)Hand with pen marking holographic chart with the word ""AI"". Artificial IntelligenceSource: shutterstock.com/everything possibleAn American semiconductor company, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) ranks among undervalued AI stocks thanks to its pioneering work regarding audio and voice technology innovation. Specifically, the company develops analog systems on chips (ASoCs) for AI applications such as smart speakers and microphones, virtual assistants, and intelligent gaming controllers. In addition, its tech is also incorporated into automotive in-dash systems.Since the beginning of this year, SWKS gained almost 16% of its equity value. Over the trailing one-year period, it’s up nearly 7%. Nevertheless, it may feature a sustained upside. For one thing, the company is both consistently profitable and commands a growth machine. Per Gurufocus, Skyworks’ three-year revenue growth rate (on a per-share basis) clocks in at 20.2%, above 70% of its peers.Further, SWKS represents one of the best value AI stocks to buy because it prints a forward multiple of only 10.58. As a discount to projected earnings, Skyworks ranks better than 89.31% of the competition. Finally, analysts peg shares as a moderate buy with a $113.25 price target (implying over 8% upside).Story continuesQualcomm (QCOM)Close-up of letters ""AI"" written on a computer chip, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocksSource: shutterstock.com/YAKOBCHUK VA multinational corporation, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) manufactures semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology. It’s one of the top undervalued AI stocks to buy thanks to its acumen in device connectivity solutions. As Qualcomm states on its website, more intelligence is moving to end devices and mobile is becoming the dominant AI platform. Therefore, the company is organically positioned to benefit.Since the start of the year, QCOM gained just under 9%. Over the past 365 days, shares slipped more than 8%. While the market might not appreciate the tech stalwart right now, you don’t want to make the same mistake. Per Gurufocus, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 11.82. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 86.26% of sector rivals.Also, Qualcomm enjoys consistent profitability and a three-year revenue growth rate of 25%. This latter stat beats out 78.48% of competing firms. Lastly, analysts peg QCOM as a moderate buy with a target of $135.26 (implying 16% upside). Thus, it makes a great case for AI stocks with high potential.Leidos (LDOS)Illustration of hand pointing finger about to touch virtual ""AI"" graphicSource: shutterstock.com/Den RiseAn American defense, aviation, information technology and biomedical research firm, Leidos (NYSE:LDOS) commands a wide footprint. Per its website, Leidos’ cutting-edge tech makes AI and machine learning algorithms trustworthy, resilient, and secure. Not only that, the company delivers its digital intelligence across multiple applications, from defense needs to civilian purposes such as biotech.To be 100% fair, LDOS may represent one of the top undervalued AI stocks on paper. However, it’s also incredibly risky. Since the beginning of this year, shares fell nearly 18%. Over the trailing one-year period, they’re below parity to the tune of over 15%. Still, for those with patience and nerves of steel, Leidos could be intriguing.Specifically, it features decent revenue growth and consistent profitability. Moreover, the market prices LDOS at a forward multiple of 13.03. As a discount to projected earnings, Leidos ranks better than 81.3% of its peers. To close, analysts peg LDOS as a moderate buy with a $101.60 price target (implying over 18% upside).On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Here are three 5G stocks poised to deliver triple-digit returns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsQualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor signSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) achieved a significant AI milestone by successfully running the Stable Diffusion text-to-image generative AI service on an Android smartphone, showcasing its innovation in the field.Generative AI involves two steps: training and inference. During training, the algorithm learns from a vast dataset of human-created images and corresponding text descriptions. Once trained, the algorithm can generate new images based on user input, a process known as inference. Importantly, Qualcomm demonstrated this capability on a smartphone by inputting the prompt: “Super cute fluffy cat warrior in armor, photorealistic, 4K, ultra-detailed, Vray rendering, unreal engine.”Qualcomm has made significant progress in on-device AI inference, potentially surpassing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the realm of generative AI. Thus, with a low valuation and its smartphone market business nearing a cyclical bottom, Qualcomm presents an appealing investment opportunity.

Indeed, this is a stock I think has more upside potential from here.Story continuesWith strong growth and the rise of artificial intelligence, semiconductor giant Broadcom has the potential to surpass a $1 trillion valuation.

Semiconductor chips, essential for AI and various products like computers, cars, smartphones and appliances, contribute to Broadcom’s success.AVGO stock has surged 58% as the chip sector rebounds, driven by strong semiconductor demand and the growth of artificial intelligence. A partnership with Apple adds to the company’s revenue and earnings growth prospects.

It also accounted for 66% of the segment’s net sales in 2022.Lockheed has delivered 894 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 345 jets in backlog till December 2022. This, along with the latest contract win, boosts sales expectations for the abovementioned segment.LMT expects to deliver 147-153 jets per year in 2023 and 2024, and 156 jets in 2025 and beyond. This should bolster the company’s revenues from the military aircraft field.Growth ProspectsPer Mordor Intelligence projections, the global military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2031. Such projections indicate immense opportunities for Lockheed to reap the benefits of military aircraft market expansion.Other prominent defense majors involved in the manufacturing of military aircraft are Northrop Grumman NOC, Airbus Group EADSY and Textron TXT. These stocks are also expected to gain from the aforementioned market’s growth opportunities.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft.

113,8ed3bd50-dbf5-398d-a745-448ce248bd35,NKE,2023-07-04,"Chunky, ugly sneakers have Nike singing the blues",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chunky-ugly-sneakers-nike-singing-184959175.html,1688410199,STORY,['NKE'],"[Three years ago, it was essentially impossible to buy Nike Air Jordan 1 Highs on the company’s SNKRS app. The high-tops would sell out in seconds—sometimes fractions of a second—and later pop up on resale sites at a hiked price. Nike drops were a cultish event in which thousands of sneakerheads would wait at their laptops, fingers poised to click “buy” on their favorite shoe models faster than other “hypebeasts,” and usually end up disappointed. Jordan 1 Highs sold for a staggering 61% premium on the resale platform StockX in 2020. In 2021, the craze was still going strong, with resold Jordans available at a 50% premium.But in the first half of 2023, the Nike high has faded, and those Jordans now resell at an average 2% discount. And Nike stock, which hit a $177.51 record high in November 2021, has tanked 37% from its peak. What’s more, the company is sitting on $8.5 billion in unsold inventory, according to its fourth quarter earnings report for 2023—that’s $1.6 billion higher than what it said were “healthy inventory levels” in its fourth quarter report in 2021.Analysts are accordingly lowering expectations for Nike’s performance for the rest of this year. Goldman Sachs downgraded its earnings per share forecast for Nike from $0.69 to $0.66 in a June note, citing “slower retail sales trends through the spring selling season.” Likewise, Morgan Stanley lowered its forecast for the stock from $130 to $127 in its June note, but maintained Nike’s overweight rating.Why isn’t Nike regaining its stride? Competitors are outpacing the iconic brand, and prolonged inflation is making consumers more careful with their money. And it has two unlikely competitors, in the form of French sporting brands Salomon and Hoka, which have stormed the sneaker market and become StockX’s fastest-growing of 2022. Salomon enjoyed a 2,277% growth in trade, while Hoka saw 713% growth, according to the online sneaker reseller.Both of these shoes fall into the category of “ugly,” chunky sneakers that began trending during the pandemic and have grown in popularity since. Part of the wide appeal of these sneakers is their functionality. Originally designed for comfort when running and walking, and not necessarily for fashion, Salomon and Hoka shoes are popular with serious runners and hikers; nurses and waiters who work on their feet; and now young, fashion-savvy Gen Zers and millennials.Story continuesThe shoes’ oversize soles and fat silhouettes are now in vogue (and literally in Vogue, on Bella Hadid’s feet), and Nike has not released a blockbuster sneaker model since the Nike React in 2019. Part of the issue is that sneaker tastes have shifted, and Nike’s most popular models may not align with current preferences.Jordans, the company’s most famous shoe line, are basketball shoes that became streetwear icons. But sneaker tastes, especially on TikTok, on which trends hinge, have pivoted more toward running, soccer, and hiking models. In addition to Salomons and Hokas, ’90s-style Adidas shoes, specifically the Samba and the Gazelle, are having a moment, and are currently staples in every fashion-conscious closet. (The German giant is weathering its own storm, and hopes these retro models can replace the death of the Yeezy.)Still, a behemoth like Nike can suffer some wounds and rally back to its original strength. Hoka and Salomon may be growing faster than the juggernaut, but they are still minnows compared with Nike. Hoka, long a niche running brand and not a mainstream fashion presence, sells 440 different sneaker models, while Nike sells an estimated 10,000. Despite an ebb in its current popularity, the iconic “swoosh” brand has a multigenerational appeal and still saw a 10% increase in year-over-year revenue. But the chunky sneaker era is reverberating.“It is not suffering from an existential crisis,” Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail, wrote about Nike in a note to clients. “However, it isn’t on the front foot either, and has to accept that the year ahead will be one of resetting, retrenching, and reformulating the way it does business.”And it has already started such resetting—in the past month alone, Nike announced several leadership changes, including changing executives at four of its branches. It also appointed a new president of Jordan and new CEO of Converse.“These shifts will allow us to streamline our focus across product, brand storytelling, and marketplace, mining deep consumer insights to deliver breakthrough innovation and engagement, while building long-term growth and profitability,” Nike CEO John Donahoe said in the May SEC filing.Nike did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

This week’s list includes Nike NKE, Adobe ADBE and FedEx FDX.The Earnings Picture Refuses to WeakenThere is no shortage of market skeptics who see this year's gains as without a fundamental basis and support.The skeptics justifiably point to the market's narrow leadership in the mega-cap Tech players as a major argument why they don't see the rally having sustainable legs. This is a fair point, though it's important to note that we are seeing other parts of the market join the leadership team recently.The bears assign much greater odds to the recession risk, which they see as grossly mispriced in the market. They see the inflation problem as being more 'sticky' than the market appreciates and see significant downside risks to current consensus earnings expectations.Recessions are notoriously hard to predict, and this 'coming recession' has proved harder than most.Without a crystal ball, it is hard to know with certainty what lies ahead in the macroeconomy. But most mainstream economists are lowering their recession odds, though they all see above-average risks of economic trouble. With inflation steadily coming down and the labor market staying fairly strong, many in the market are starting to assign bigger odds to the 'soft landing' scenario.We are seeing some early evidence of this in the real-time earnings estimate revisions data as well.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have consistently been flagging a favorable turn in the revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, with earnings estimates stabilizing in the aggregate after consistently coming down for almost a year and actually starting to go up for some key sectors.This combination of favorable macroeconomic developments and optimism about the transformational power of artificial intelligence (AI) seems to be driving market optimism.Story continuesThe -9.5% decline in Q2 earnings today is down from -7.2% at the start of the quarter, with estimates for 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors coming down. The biggest cuts to earnings estimates have been for the Energy, Aerospace, and Consumer Discretionary sectors.On the positive side, Q2 earnings estimates increased for the Transportation, Tech, Construction, and Industrial Products sectors.Please note that while 2023 Q2 estimates have come down, the magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to what we saw in the comparable periods of the preceding couple of quarters. In other words, estimates haven't fallen as much as they did the last few quarters, not only for Q2 but also for the rest of the year.As noted earlier, we have been pointing out a notable stabilization in the revisions front lately, which roughly coincided with the start of Q2 in April 2023. This was a shift in the overall revisions trend that had been in place for almost a year before that.Getting back to the 2023 Q2 expectations, embedded in the aforementioned earnings and revenue growth projections, is the expectation of continued margin pressures, which has been a recurring theme in recent quarters.2023 Q2 will be the 6th consecutive quarter of declining margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Margins in Q2 are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest margin pressure expected to be in the Basic Materials, Construction, Energy, Medical, Conglomerates, Autos, Aerospace, and Tech sectors.On the positive side, the Finance sector is the only one expected to experience significant margin gains, with the Consumer Discretionary sector as a distant second. Sectors expected to be essentially flat margins relative to 2022 Q2 are Retail, Utilities, and Industrial Products.As noted earlier in the context of discussing the revisions trend of 2023 Q2 estimates, we have been observing a notable stabilization in the revisions trend since the start of April 2023.This stabilization in 2023 earnings estimates represented a notable reversal in the persistently negative trend that had been in place for almost a year. Current expectations for 2023, as represented by the above chart, are down -13.5% since the April 2022 peak.Since the start of 2023 Q2 in April, aggregate earnings estimates for 2023 are essentially flat, with 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors enjoying positive estimate revisions in that time period. Sectors enjoying positive estimate revisions since the start of Q2 include Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Tech, and Retail.Q2 Earnings ScorecardThe Q2 earnings season will really get going with the July 14th quarterly release from JPMorgan (JPM) and the other big banks. But the Q2 reporting cycle has officially gotten underway already, with results from 18 S&amp;P 500 members already out. All of these 18 index members have fiscal quarters ending in May, which we and other data vendors count as part of the June-quarter tally.In fact, by the time JPMorgan comes with its quarterly results, we will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S&amp;P 500 members. Nike is the latest index member that came out with fiscal May-quarter results recently, with Adobe, FedEx and others included among the 18 that have reported already.Total Q2 earnings for these 18 index members are down -21.5% from the same period last year on +0.6% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.This is too small and unrepresentative of a sample to draw any conclusions from. Still, the comparison charts nevertheless put the Q2 results from these 18 index members with what we had seen from the same group of companies in other recent periods.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Q2 Earnings: What Can Investors Expect?  Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

116,220f13f7-a71b-3614-bd68-1fef1e5b59c9,VFC,2023-07-04,V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) institutional owners may be pleased with recent gains after 54% loss over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/v-f-corporation-nyse-vfc-132430009.html,1688390670,STORY,['VFC'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, V.F's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions51% of the business is held by the top 14 shareholders Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessEvery investor in V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 84% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 3.5% increase in share prices after a year of 54% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of V.F, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for V.F ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About V.F?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that V.F does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at V.F's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in V.F. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.9% and 6.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of V.FWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of V.F. Corporation in their own names. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own US$53m worth of shares. Arguably, recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over V.F. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   4 warning signs for V.F (2 can't be ignored)  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

117,100b417b-ba00-375c-bd89-5e9612c68d22,VFC,2023-07-04,Fresh Blood: 3 Stocks Ready to Rally Under New CEOs,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fresh-blood-3-stocks-ready-110045328.html,1687950045,STORY,"['VTRS', 'VFC', 'PFE']","[In recent years, S&amp;P 500 companies with new chief executive officers (CEOs) have become a regular occurrence. That’s because CEOs are moving on more quickly — both by choice and because of activist investors — and that means there are always interesting possibilities for stocks set to rally under new CEOs.Equilar, a research company specializing in corporate leadership data, reported earlier this year that 62 of the Equilar 500 — America’s largest companies by revenue — announced CEO departures in 2022, up from 49 in 2021. The average tenure of CEOs leaving in 2022 was 7.7 years. Only 18 were in the top job for more than 10 years. In searching for stocks ready to rally under new CEOs, I thought about including Unilever (NYSE:UL). The U.K.-based consumer goods company will see incoming CEO Hein Schumacher take over in July with the difficult assignment of reinvigorating the company’s stock. Shares have lost 6.5% over the past five years compared to a 92% gain for Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) over the same period.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, because I want to focus on American-based companies, I’ve opted to pass on Unilever and go for S&amp;P 500 companies instead. Below are three stocks ready to rally under new leadership.Viatris (VTRS)Viatris (VTRS) website page. Viatris.com logo on display screenSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.comViatris (NASDAQ:VTRS) is the global healthcare company created by merging Pfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) Upjohn business and Mylan N.V. in November 2020. Pfizer shareholders got 0.124079 shares of Viatris for each share in the former parent. Viatris shares are down 37% since the merger.On April 1, Scott Smith became the new CEO of Viatris, replacing Michael Goettler. Smith joined the company’s board in December 2022. He was a senior executive at Celgene for 10 years. The cancer and immunology drug company was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) in 2019. Among Smith’s accomplishments was developing and commercializing Otezla, a blockbuster drug to treat psoriasis. Story continuesSmith is taking over Viatris as it transitions into a high-growth, high-cash-flow business. In 2023, the company expects to generate as much as $9 billion in cash from divestitures. In 2024, it expects to generate at least $2.3 billion in free cash flow annually, with 50% allocated toward dividends and share repurchases. Given Smith’s experience taking drugs from clinical trials through the commercialization stage, investors should expect a bright future. However, Wall Street has yet to buy into the company’s new strategic plan. Sometimes it takes a new CEO 12 months to get up to speed. In time, this appointment should reap dividends for Viatris shareholders. VF Corporation (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comVF Corporation (NYSE:VFC) went outside the apparel and footwear industry to appoint Bracken Darrell as its new CEO, who will take over on July 17. Darrell was the chief executive of Logitech International (NASDAQ:LOGI) for 10 years until stepping down earlier this month to pursue “other opportunities,” which turned out to be heading up the company that owns popular brands such as Vans, The North Face and Timberland.LOGI stock increased by more than 650% during Darrell’s tenure. As recently as June 2021, it traded near $140 a share due to Covid-19 and the surge in demand driven by the pandemic.Darrell takes over VF at a similar stage to when he took over as Logitech’s CEO. VF’s stock is down 75% over the past five years. And the board believes it’s made an inspired hire.“VF’s Board of Directors couldn’t be more pleased with our appointment of Bracken as VF’s 12th CEO in the company’s 124-year history,” said Richard Carucci, who was recently named chair of the board. “We conducted an extensive search and determined that Bracken has all the attributes to excel in this role. He is a transformational and visionary business leader with a strong track record of performance across multiple industries.”I, too, think it’s a smart move. It reminds me of the hire of Hubert Joly by Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) in August 2012. The hospitality executive didn’t have retail experience and several analysts pooh-poohed the move. Boy, were they wrong. Joly delivered one of the all-time retail turnaround stories. I could see the same thing happening with VF’s iconic brands. If you’re an aggressive investor, you ought to buy VFC stock in a big way. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)The logo of the new Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) company on smartphone screen.Source: Jimmy Tudeschi / Shutterstock.comWarner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) didn’t hire a new CEO. That job is held by an overpaid David Zaslav, who has earned close to half a billion dollars in the past five years. But the media conglomerate is looking for one at CNN after Zaslav fired Chris Licht in early June.WBD stock traded 16% higher over two days to $14 a share on the news. However, once it became clear that Licht’s firing did little for the overall health of the company, shares fell back below $12, where they were before the announcement. The reality is that Warner Bros. Discovery has a boatload in debt. As a result, it’s selling off anything that doesn’t generate enough cash flow. It continues to cut jobs to save cash. Removing “HBO” from HBO Max did little to slow the streaming platform’s content purge. Zaslav always saw the Warner Media merger as a legacy ego project that he could justify under the guise that scale in media was vital to success. Now that he’s got what he wished for, he needs to find people who can make money for WBD — and fast. Hiring a new CEO at CNN and then spinning it off would be one way to get investors excited about WBD stock. The company will have to do a lot more to move its shares into the $20s, but it’s possible. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This is conditional on approval by its board of directors at its regularly scheduled meeting in July.Last year, Wells Fargo increased its dividend for third-quarter 2022 to 30 cents per share, indicating a 20% sequential hike following the annual stress test.Also, over the four-quarter period beginning third-quarter 2023 through second-quarter 2024, WFC has the capacity to repurchase shares. Share repurchase activity will be assessed as part of the company’s internal capital adequacy framework. In first-quarter 2023, it repurchased 86.4 million shares and had 164 million shares remaining under the repurchase authorization.Per CEO Charlie Scharf, “This year’s CCAR stress test affirmed that Wells Fargo remains in a strong capital position, reflecting the value of our franchise and benefits of our operating model.”Markedly, WFC continues to build on its deposit base, which witnessed a three-year (ended 2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.5%. The metric declined in the first quarter of 2023. While the pace of deposit growth is likely to continue moderating in the near term, the considerable strength in the consumer business and commercial banking segments will likely support the deposit balance in the upcoming period. This is likely to strengthen the bank’s liquidity position.Shares of WFC have gained 3.3% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s fall of 5.5%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continues WFC currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This follows no change in dividend payout last year.Likewise, GS announced plans to hike the dividend from the current $2.50 per share to $2.75.

During the FDA committee meeting held last month, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax presented their pre-clinical findings supporting the use of their own vaccines, which target the XBB.1.5 variant. The preclinical data from these manufacturers indicate that a monovalent vaccine is more effective against a bivalent vaccine.Story continuesLast month, Pfizer and BioNTech submitted filings with both the EMA and FDA seeking approval for their Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. If approved, the companies intend to launch their vaccine for the 2023-2024 fall and winter season. Pfizer/BioNTech expect to make their updated vaccine ready for supply immediately post-regulatory approvals.Novavax stated that it is manufacturing its protein-based monovalent XBB.1.5 COVID vaccine candidate at a commercial scale, intended to be in the market during the upcoming fall vaccination campaign.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At International Business MachinesIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the CFO and Senior VP of Finance &amp; Operations, James Kavanaugh, sold US$5.2m worth of shares at a price of US$134 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$134. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In total, International Business Machines insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of International Business MachinesFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 0.07% of International Business Machines shares, worth about US$91m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About International Business Machines Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded International Business Machines shares in the last quarter. Our analysis of International Business Machines insider transactions leaves us cautious. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

128,a4ace631-87de-3b03-9828-dbc7163a69b4,IBM,2023-07-04,10 Stocks Jumping On The Generative AI Wagon,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-stocks-jumping-generative-ai-224432918.html,1688424272,STORY,"['AI', 'CSCO', 'AMZN', 'ACN', 'TRI', 'NVDA', 'IBM', 'SNOW']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at 10 stocks jumping on the generative AI wagon. To skip our detailed analysis of the developments taking place within the AI sector, you can go directly to read about the 5 Stocks Jumping On The Generative AI Wagon.The markets have been overwhelmingly influenced by artificial intelligence (AI) and, within it, generative AI this year. Every company is entering the AI race in fear of being left behind in the face of rapid technological changes and advancements, while those companies who were already part of the AI sector have been enjoying quite a boost in light of their head start on others. With AI becoming such an integral part of the economy today, it is unsurprising to see how companies are trying to jump on the AI bandwagon.Recent AI Deals and ProgramsAs noted on CNBC's TechCheck on June 27 recent partnership between Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was announced this June, which highlighted the former's intentions to try and benefit from the latter's growing influence within the AI space. The partnership aims to make advanced AI capabilities available to enterprises. By combining Snowflake Inc.'s (NYSE:SNOW) ability to manage massive amounts of data with NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU-accelerated computing and NeMo platform, which develops large language models (LLMs), the partnership will help businesses use their data to make custom LLMs for generative AI services. These include AI chatbots like ChatGPT and search and summarization services as well.Another AI deal in the spotlight today is Thomson Reuters Corporation's (NYSE:TRI) $650 million acquisition of Castext, a company that develops AI-powered legal workflows. Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) is aiming to make generative AI solutions available to its customers through this deal. Another AI deal that has become the talk of the markets is the Databricks acquisition of MosaicML for $1.3 billion. Through MosaicML, you can train and deploy LLMs and other generative AI models in your data in a secure environment. MosaicML has been considered a rival to OpenAI, meaning that with this acquisition, Databricks has also joined the generative AI race.Story continues""Pioneers Need To Be Willing To Be Misunderstood For Long Periods Of Time""CNBC showed on June 22 that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also announced a $100 million program through which it hopes to help its customers use generative AI. The markets have been viewing Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a lagger in the generative AI space so far, so this move may seem to some as a way to rectify this image. The company may be attempting to mark its own territory within this space by signaling to other big tech competitors that it is now working to bring generative AI tools and models to its cloud customers through Amazon Web Services. Here are some comments on this move from Adam Selipsky, the CEO of Amazon Web Services:""The reality of it is that Amazon has been working on artificial intelligence, as mentioned earlier, for longer than almost any of these companies. We have long accumulated experience, we have many, many experts, thousands of practioners of different kinds inside the company. Many of those experts are now working specifically on generative AI. Nobody else has the full stack of capabilities that we're putting together.""Selipsky also mentioned in his CNBC interview that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is now also working on developing its own ""machine learning, AI-specific chips"" alongside several other projects within the AI space. It was noted that other companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have been receiving more recognition on Wall Street for their AI contributions, particularly in generative AI, to which Selipsky responded that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a saying which goes ""pioneers have to be willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time."" He elaborated on this by saying that the company has many past examples which show that it was more focused on its customers and building what they want, adding that if that led to misconceptions about the company's trajectory, that was alright, as long as its customers understood where it was going. In light of this, Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) move to make generative AI available to its customers now may begin to make more sense to Wall Street as this shows how the company is once again trying its best to meet customer needs.The above-mentioned deals, acquisitions, and programs highlight how many companies are trying to enter the generative AI race by partnering with other companies using generative AI. We have elaborated on more of these companies below in our list to show which generative AI stocks the markets should be watching today.10 Stocks Jumping On The Generative AI WagonPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyWe have selected stocks that have recently been making moves to join the AI sector, particularly the generative AI area, for our list below. We used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter to rank these stocks from the lowest to the highest number of hedge funds holding stakes in them.Stocks Jumping On The Generative AI Wagon10. Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) is a research and consulting services company based in Toronto, Canada. The company provides business information services internationally.This June, Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) agreed to acquire Casetext for $650 million. Casetext is a legal AI company that develops AI-powered legal workflows. Steve Hasker, the CEO of Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) commented that this acquisition would be part of the company's ""build, partner, and buy strategy"" through which it can bring generative AI solutions to its customers.There were 16 hedge funds long Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $144 million.Tim Casey, an analyst at BMO Capital, maintains an Outperform rating on Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) as of June 28. The analyst also raised his price target from $184 to $192.Junto Capital Management was the largest shareholder in Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) at the end of the first quarter, holding 268,335 shares in the company.9. C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Our hedge fund data for the first quarter shows 24 funds holding stakes in C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI). Their total stake value in the company was $151 million.C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) is an information technology company based in Redwood City, California. The company has developed a new enterprise search tool powered by language models similar to those powering ChatGPT. C3.ai, Inc.'s (NYSE:AI) search bar retrieves answers from an organization's own knowledge base and can summarize this information while also citing its sources.On June 1, Daniel Ives at Wedbush upgraded C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) shares from Neutral to Outperform while also raising his price target on the stock from $24 to $50.Kerrisdale Capital mentioned C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) in its March investor letter:“We are short shares of C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), a $4 billion market capitalization enterprise software company that has risen from the ashes of its busted IPO based on the misconception that its self-proclaimed “AI leadership” somehow positions it to benefit from Silicon Valley’s current tech theme du jour: generative AI as represented by media obsession ChatGPT. We believe these speculative flames won’t burn bright much longer, as the realities of C3’s poor customer traction, failing sales partnerships, and financial pressures will catalyze what is likely to be a painful reality check.This isn’t the first time C3 has sought to ride a hot investment theme. The company was originally founded as C3 Energy to develop analytics solutions for public utilities preparing for the emergence of cap-and-trade and smart grids. C3 pivoted in 2016, renaming the company C3 IoT to capitalize on that buzzy opportunity. But management’s master stroke was rebranding operations as C3.ai in 2019 and going public with the “AI” stock ticker, thus securing its place as the default artificial intelligence stock play for the undiscriminating investor despite the bulk of its business coming from relatively dated analytics models built for a very small number of utility, energy, and government customers. C3 is a minor, cash-burning consulting and services business masquerading as a software company, and its true value is a fraction of its current market capitalization…” (Click here to read the full text)C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), like Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), is a stock that might see more upside because of its involvement in generative AI.8. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Credit Suisse analyst Shannon Cross reiterated an Outperform rating on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) on June 26 alongside a $162 price target.Citadel Investment Group held 3.1 million shares in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) at the end of the first quarter, making it the most prominent shareholder in the company for that quarter.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is another information technology company on our list. It is based in Armonk, New York. The company launched a new generative AI platform, Watsonx, this May for businesses. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) believes Watsonx can help businesses manage their own AI-supported data while ensuring their data is secure and in compliance with regulatory and ethical requirements.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was spotted in the portfolios of 49 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $1.5 billion.7. Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60In June, Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN), an information technology company, acquired Flutura, an industrial AI company based in India, to help boost its own industrial AI services. It has also launched a new AI Navigator for Enterprise, a generative AI-based platform that will help its clients define business cases, make decisions, and more.We saw Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) in the 13F holdings of 60 hedge funds during the first quarter. Their total stake value was $2.8 billion.An Outperform rating was reiterated on Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) shares on June 23 by Daniel Perlin, an analyst at RBC Capital, who also holds a $340 price target on the stock.In its first-quarter 2023 investor letter, Polen Capital said the following about Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN):“To fund this new purchase, we made modest trims to our positions in Aon and Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN). In order to fund the purchase of, and subsequent addition to, Teleperformance, we modestly trimmed our positions in Aon and Accenture. We trimmed our weighting in Aon, though it remains a top three weighting in the Portfolio. We believed there was room to trim the position after significant relative outperformance by the stock in 2022. There is no change to our positive outlook for this business. We also trimmed our weighting in Accenture, our second trim in the past four months, as the company returns to a normal growth trajectory after an extended stretch of robust results brought about by the pandemic. In addition to growth normalizing, we see increased signs of slowing enterprise tech spending. We continue to believe Accenture is well positioned to grow in line with historical performance, meaning we see the business producing low-double digit total return growth from here.”Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN), like Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), is a stock to watch in light of generative AI developments.6. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61On June 30, Jim Suva at Citigroup initiated coverage on Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) with a Neutral rating and a $54 price target.In the first quarter, 61 hedge funds were long Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO). Their total stake value was $2.5 billion.Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) sells Internet Protocol-based networking and other products internationally. The company also provides AI and machine learning offerings, including computing solutions for enterprises with a focus on cybersecurity, keeping in mind the threats posed by generative AI technology. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) has also added new generative AI features across its Collaboration and Security portfolios.Holding 9.6 million shares, AQR Capital Management was the largest shareholder in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) at the end of the first quarter.Artisan Partners made the following comment about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We had one sale this quarter, exiting network equipment company Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO). We chose to use the proceeds on more attractive value opportunities as Cisco’s growth has come in below what we had hoped for, and the company is increasingly looking at M&amp;A to augment its growth rate.”Click to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks Jumping On The Generative AI WagonSuggested articles:Top 10 Generative Artificial Intelligence Companies to Invest In10 AI Stocks Billionaires are Loading Up On10 Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI BoomDisclosure: None. 10 Stocks Jumping On The Generative AI Wagon is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to skip our industry analysis and introduction to the top players, head on over to 5 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Buy. Machine learning is a technology that is right at the heart of 2023's technological revolution. Over the past couple of decades, we have seen several technological products such as semiconductors, personal computing devices, and the Internet revolutionize both business and public life. Now, it's time for machine learning to shine since it is one of the applications of artificial intelligence - the hottest technology these days.Artificial intelligence has also played a crucial role in the stock market this year. The current rally in artificial intelligence started when ChatGPT made waves on the internet and impressed users with its ability to generate life like responses. This injected fresh optimism into the shares of firms that are directly linked to Open AI. These include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs) are responsible for powering Chat GPT and training the artificial intelligence platform. And these products are made by TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer.As a whole, the largest shareholders of AI related firms have profited quite a bit from artificial intelligence stocks. These have cumulatively led to billionaires such as Larry Ellison of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) adding $150 billion to their wealth. NVIDIA's shares are up by a whopping 195% year to date and the firm is the only semiconductor company that is currently worth more than a trillion dollars on the stock market. Meta, which faced a bloodbath on the stock market last year after its chief Mark Zuckerberg plowed billions of dollars into the metaverse, also saw some much needed love. Its shares are up by 130% year to date, lending it a market value of $735 billion.Story continuesThe investor attention on machine learning is not without reason either, especially when we consider the market value and growth rates of the industry. For instance, a report from Fortune Business Insights outlines that the market is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.8% between 2022 and 2029 to grow from an initial $21 billion at 2023 end to $210 billion by the end of the forecast period. Similarly, a report from Market Research Future also has a 38.8% CAGR for a value of $106 billion by 2030.So what are the top players in the machine learning market doing these days? Well, NVIDIA made a big but silent move in February this year when it acquired the machine learning startup OmniML. OmniML is a software company that develops software to speed up the machine learning process. Machine learning requires programmers and others to train models before the models are able to generate insights. OmniML automates this entire process to streamline the development process and enable quicker deployment of machine learning models. NVIDIA also has its own resources that enable developers to leverage and use machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. It partnered up with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in May 2023 to use the latter's Azure machine learning platform for providing products and services to users for rapidly deploying these networks.Another key player in the machine learning industry is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Alphabet has massive computing resources at its disposal, allowing it to develop numerous models for countless different use cases such as search engine queries. Another use case that is seeing attention from Google is money laundering. Announced in June 2023, the new platform uses machine learning to create a customer risk score to lower costs, improve risk detection, and provide a better customer experience. The anti money laundering platform has also been employed by HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) and Banco Bradesco S.A. (NYSE:BBD), with the former reporting as much as a fourfold increase in recognizing suspicious activity and a 60% reduction in alert volumes.Yet, as big as Google is, anti money laundering is just one of the ways in which it is utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence. During the firm's first quarter of 2023 earnings call, its chief Mr. Sundar Pichai shared:And as we continue to bring AI to our products, our AI principles and the highest standards of information integrity remain at the core of all our work.As one example, our perspective API helps to identify and reduce the amount of toxic text that language models train on with significant benefits for information quality. This is designed to help ensure the safety of generative AI applications before they are released to the public.We are proud to have world-class research teams who have been advancing the breakthroughs underpinning this new era of AI. Last week, I announced that we are bringing together the Brain Team in Google Research and DeepMind into one unit. Combining all this talent into 1 focused team, backed by the pooled computational resources of Google, will help accelerate our progress and develop the most capable AI systems safely and responsibly.On to my second theme, the company’s sharpened focus.I spoke last quarter about our commitment to invest responsibly and with discipline and to find areas where we can operate more cost effectively and with greater velocity. We have significant multiyear efforts underway to create savings, such as improving machine utilization and finding more scalable and efficient ways to train and serve machine learning models. We are making our data centers more efficient, redistributing workloads and equipment where servers aren’t being fully used. This is important work as we continue to significantly invest in infrastructure to drive our many AI opportunities. Improving external procurement is another area where data suggests significant savings, and this work is underway. And we are taking concrete steps to manage our real estate portfolio to ensure it meets our current and future needs.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the best machine learning stocks that are being favored by hedge funds. Som top machine learning stock picks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).12 Best Machine Learning Stocks To BuyOur MethodologyTo make our list of the best machine learning stocks, we first compiled a list of all companies that either provide the hardware for machine learning or have significant products that are based on the technology.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend capture strategy and performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best July Dividend Stocks To Buy. The investment landscape is undergoing substantial shifts this year as investors explore different strategies to make the most of the market rebound. Last year, investors loaded up on high-dividend stocks to generate regular income. However, this preference for dividend stocks has now somehow fallen out of favor. Ned Davis Research’s data shows that non-dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have gained approximately 18% in 2023, surpassing a roughly 4% increase seen by dividend-paying companies. The report also mentioned that around 400 companies in the index currently offer a dividend.That said, Ned Davis Research has also highlighted that dividend stocks typically exhibit strong performance when entering an economic slowdown. Therefore, there is a significant possibility for investors to refocus their attention on dividend stocks in the second half of this year as well. With worries of a potential recession still present, defensive companies, known for their substantial dividends, might once again outperform. This is because consumers tend to prioritize essential expenses like utility bills, household goods, and medical costs over discretionary purchases during an economic downturn. Paul Baiocchi, a chief ETF strategist at SS&amp;C ALPS Advisors, spoke with Wall Street Journal about the outlook of dividend stocks this year. He said:“The bulk of your total return from your stock market portfolio has come from compounded dividends over time, much more so than the actual price appreciation of the stock market. We don’t think that the first six months of 2023 has necessarily altered that overall outlook for dividends going forward.”Where the market has seen an increased interest in AI stocks, it also revealed that investors remain highly focused on generating income and achieving compounded growth. This emphasis was evident in the most recent quarter, as companies worldwide distributed a record-breaking amount of dividends. According to a report by Janus Henderson, during the first quarter of 2023, the largest 1,200 public companies globally distributed a total of $326.7 billion in dividends. This represents a 12% increase compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. The report also mentioned that the US accounted for nearly half of the corporate dividends distributed in Q1. The growth in dividends was primarily driven by the real estate, technology, and healthcare sectors. Some of the best dividend stocks that are grabbing investors’ attention include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).Story continuesAlso read: 10 Stocks that Paid Special Dividends in 2023Dividend Capture Strategy:Apart from investing in dividend-growing companies to generate consistent income, investors also employ a dividend capture strategy. This strategy involves buying shares of a company just before the ex-dividend date, which is the last day to own the stock and still be eligible to receive the upcoming dividend payment. Once the dividend is paid, the investor sells the shares.

This comes despite upbeat economic data on the labor and housing market in June.The Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Jun 30 that personal income rose 0.4% or $91.2 billion in May. Disposable personal income, which excluded personal taxes, also rose 0.4% or $86.7 billion, in May.However, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) increased a modest 0.1% or $18.9 billion in May. Real personal consumption expenditure declined marginally.Although personal income has been on the rise, thanks to a resilient labor market that has seen solid job additions to the economy almost every month and steady growth in wages, consumers have been spending cautiously.Breaking down the $18.9 billion consumer spending in May, $5.2 billion was spent on services led by a surge in spending on healthcare. However, the growth was offset primarily by a $33.1 billion decline in spending on goods.On the other hand, the savings rate jumped to 4.6% in May from April’s rise of 4.3%.Although inflation has started showing signs of easing, it is still elevated and a lot higher than the Fed’s target level of 2%. Understandably, consumers are unsure about the Fed’s future course of action as it has indicated two more rate hikes of 25 basis points each by the end of this year.Market participants believe that the first of the hikes could be implemented as soon as July. This has once again made consumers concerned, leading them to save more and cut down on spending. However, it is difficult to cut down on spending on necessities as they are everyday items.Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in consumer staple stocks. The consumer staples sector is known for its stability and resilience, as consumer demand for essential goods tends to remain consistent regardless of economic fluctuations. These companies provide products that are considered everyday necessities, making the sector defensive in nature.Story continuesOur ChoicesThe non-cyclical nature of these stocks protects them from the market's vagaries.

View our latest analysis for McCormick To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, McCormick actually saw its EPS drop 4.0% per year.By glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the decline in earnings per share is not representative of how the business has changed over the years. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.The modest 1.8% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. On the other hand, McCormick's revenue is growing nicely, at a compound rate of 5.2% over the last five years. It's quite possible that management are prioritizing revenue growth over EPS growth at the moment.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthMcCormick is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for McCormick the TSR over the last 5 years was 57%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveMcCormick shareholders are up 7.5% for the year (even including dividends). But that return falls short of the market. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 9% over five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand McCormick better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with McCormick .But note: McCormick may not be the best stock to buy.

Kirby said over the weekend that United is working with regional authorities to get more gates at the airport but will need to reduce its schedule there to create more of a buffer, especially during thunderstorm season.Kirby continued to place much of the blame for his airline's recent struggles on the Federal Aviation Administration, which reduced the number of flights in and out of Newark a week ago. That caused United to cancel flights and left planes and crews stranded out of position.Nearly 2.7 million people per day have been streaming through airport checkpoints since Thursday, including 2.88 million on Friday, the highest number ever recorded by the Transportation Security Administration.The Federal Aviation Administration expected about 36,500 flights on Monday and fewer than 32,000 Tuesday, then a jump to nearly 50,000 flights Wednesday, when more holiday revelers will return home.]"

(NYSE: PNC) last week received the results of the Federal Reserve's 2023 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The Federal Reserve's CCAR disclosure included its estimate of PNC's minimum capital ratios for the period from the first quarter of 2023 through the first quarter of 2025 under the hypothetical Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario. Based on PNC's strong results, PNC's calculated Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) for the four-quarter period beginning Oct. 1, 2023 is below the 2.5% regulatory floor and minimum SCB amount, resulting in an SCB established at the 2.5% floor. This is a decrease from the 2.9% SCB in effect through Sept. 30, 2023.  PNC's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio significantly exceeds the regulatory minimum (4.5%) plus our SCB, reflecting our strong capital levels.PNC's board of directors approved raising the quarterly cash dividend on common stock in the third quarter of 2023 to $1.55 per share, an increase of $0.05 per share or 3%.""The increase in our dividend reflects the continued strength of our capital and liquidity levels, and our board's confidence in our strategy and outlook,"" said William S. Demchak, PNC chairman, president and chief executive officer.Consistent with the SCB framework, which allows for capital returns in amounts in excess of the SCB minimum levels, our board of directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 47% were still available for repurchase at March 31, 2023.  Due to the expected issuance by the Federal banking agencies of proposed rules to adjust the Basel III capital framework, share repurchase activity is expected to be reduced in the third quarter of 2023 compared to recent prior quarters. PNC continues to evaluate and may adjust share repurchase activity, as actual amounts and timing are dependent on market and economic conditions as well as other factors.

Some industry players have ski and sports businesses, while some operate health and wellness centers onboard cruise ships and at destination resorts. Many companies are engaged in hospitality and related businesses. A few of the industry participants also provide weight management products and services. These companies primarily thrive on overall economic growth, which fuels consumer demand for products. Demand, which is highly dependent on business cycles, is driven by a healthy labor market, rising wages and a growing disposable income.3 Trends Shaping the Leisure &amp; Recreation Services Industry's FutureRobust Demand Aid Cruise Operators: The cruise industry is benefiting from strong demand for cruising, accelerating booking volumes and the relaxation in COVID-related protocols. However, the closure of cruise operations in China is hurting the industry. The cruise operators’ operations are likely to be influenced by the uncertainty related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Geopolitical developments have pushed fuel curves higher. Due to the war, most cruise operators have decided to withdraw all activity in Russia.Theme Park Operators &amp; Live Entertainment Companies Bouncing Back: The theme park industry has been benefiting from robust demand. Theme park operators have been gaining from improving visitation. Consumer spending at theme parks continues rising. Live entertainment firms have been benefiting from pent-up demand for live events and robust ticket sales.Concerns of Slowing Global Economy &amp; High Inflation: A slowdown in the global economy is likely to hurt the industry. Concerns about a global slowdown and a possible recession loom large over the stock market. Inflation in the United States is the biggest challenge for the economy. The U.S. consumer inflation rate fell to 4.0% in May 2023, marking the lowest since March 2021 and slightly below market expectations of 4.1%. Yet, numbers are far from the Federal Reserve’s ambitious target of 2% for a strong economy. Inflationary cost increases in labor, compensation, healthcare, freight and rent are leading to higher expenses.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry is grouped within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

It may not have been easy to hold on to RCL for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Royal Caribbean's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Royal Caribbean's main business drivers.Based in Miami and incorporated in 1985, Royal Caribbean Cruises is a cruise company. It owns and operates three global brands — Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises. Additionally, it has 50% investment in a joint venture with TUI AG, which operates the brand TUI Cruises.The company’s cruise brands primarily serve the contemporary, premium and deluxe segments of the cruise vacation industry, which also includes the budget and luxury segments. These brands operate 64 ships. The ships operate on a selection of diverse itineraries worldwide that include roughly 1,000 destinations on all seven continents.The company reports revenues under the following segments — Passenger ticket revenues (65.5% of total revenues in 2022) and Onboard and other revenues (34.5%).Across the company’s five brands, nearly 5.5 million guests sailed in 2022. By the end of 2022, 64 out of 75 ships returned to operations, representing more than 85% of its worldwide capacity. The company’s bookings improved sequentially by 2022-end. As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had nearly $4.2 billion in customer deposits.In the third quarter of 2022, the company unveiled a three-year financial performance initiative - Trifecta Program, thereby articulating longer-term financial objectives. The program emphasizes on financial coordinates, including Adjusted EBITDA per APCD, Adjusted EPS and ROIC with an intent to achieve it by 2025-end. Under this program, the company expects to achieve a triple-digit adjusted EBITDA per APCD, exceeding the earlier record adjusted EBITDA per APCD of $87 in 2019.

The private entities are looking for an opportunity to purchase a majority stake in the Worldpay unit.Per the report, a potential bid might put a valuation of more than $15 billion for the unit. The entities looking to offer a suitable bid include the private equity investor, Advent, which was part of a consortium that owned the payments provider business earlier. The Chicago-based private equity company, GTCR, is also expected to be on the list of potential buyers.This February, Fidelity National announced that it was planning to spin off its Merchant Solutions business, which includes the Worldpay business. FIS stated that the tax-free spin-off would create more value for shareholders. The Merchant Solutions unit contributed 32.9% to revenues last year. Fidelity National bought Worldpay in 2019 through a deal valued at around $43 billion, including debt.The idea of a spin-off surfaced during an assessment of Fidelity National’s business, operations, strategy and structure. FIS expects the move to improve both the companies’ performances and simplify operations. The company plans to maintain a commercial relationship following the move.In the first quarter, Merchant Solutions’ revenues were recorded at $1,105 million, which dropped 1% year over year. However, organic revenue growth came in at 2%. The adjusted EBITDA margin deteriorated 350 bps year over year to 43.5% in the first quarter due to a lower-margin revenue mix.

A tough operating environment, lower discretionary spending due to an overall inflationary landscape and a higher interest rate environment have cooled demand.To navigate troubled waters, industry participants have been directing resources toward digital platforms, accelerating fleet optimization and augmenting the supply chain. Retailers have been focusing on the superior product strategy, the advancement of omnichannel capabilities, prudent capital investments and greater customer reach. Backed by these initiatives, companies like Tapestry, Inc. TPR, Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. ANF and Stitch Fix, Inc. SFIX are better placed.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry comprises companies that offer apparel, footwear, accessories, intimates and beauty products, as well as fitness and lifestyle products for use in yoga, training and sports under various brands in domestic and international markets. Quite a few players offer bag collections, including business cases, computer bags and backpacks, leather goods, such as wallets, card cases, travel organizers and belts, and watches, sunglasses, fragrances and ready-to-wear as well as cold-weather accessories. Markedly, companies showcase products to customers directly through their branded retail stores, mobile applications, catalogs and websites. Some industry participants also provide products via department stores, specialty retailers, third-party e-commerce sites and franchisees who operate brand-dedicated stores.4 Key Trends to Watch in the Retail - Apparel And Shoes IndustryPressure on Margins to Linger: The industry is quite fragmented, with companies vying for a bigger slice of the pie on attributes, such as price, products and speed to market. To address these, a significant number of players in the industry have been investing in strengthening their digital ecosystem and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors bolster sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.Story continuesSoft Consumer Activity May Hit Revenues: Elevating prices and geopolitical concerns continue to pose a threat to consumer spending activity. Undoubtedly, the industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. Rising prices have been discomforting family budgets. The Fed’s aggressive rate hikes to tame inflation also made things tough for consumers by squeezing disposable income. Consequently, the demand has softened. Per the Commerce Department, sales at clothing &amp; clothing accessories outlets declined 0.2% year over year in May.Brand Enhancement, Capital Discipline: Industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. The launch of newer styles, customization options and refreshed store environments enable them to woo shoppers. Efforts to enhance the brand portfolio via marketing strategies, buyouts, innovations and alliances are likely to keep supporting players in the space. The companies have been taking steps to strengthen their financial position. They have been making every move, from managing the inventory and closing underperforming stores to optimizing capital expenditures and enhancing operational efficiency.Diversification &amp; Digitization Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior, industry participants have been playing dual in-store and online roles. They are building an omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at a store, which are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, companies have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry is a group within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #201, which places it in the bottom 20% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of January 2023, the industry’s earnings estimate has declined 29.5%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has advanced 5.1% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s increase of 16.5%.

To skip our detailed analysis of the developments taking place within the AI sector, you can go directly to read about the 5 Stocks Jumping On The Generative AI Wagon.The markets have been overwhelmingly influenced by artificial intelligence (AI) and, within it, generative AI this year. Every company is entering the AI race in fear of being left behind in the face of rapid technological changes and advancements, while those companies who were already part of the AI sector have been enjoying quite a boost in light of their head start on others. With AI becoming such an integral part of the economy today, it is unsurprising to see how companies are trying to jump on the AI bandwagon.Recent AI Deals and ProgramsAs noted on CNBC's TechCheck on June 27 recent partnership between Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was announced this June, which highlighted the former's intentions to try and benefit from the latter's growing influence within the AI space. The partnership aims to make advanced AI capabilities available to enterprises. By combining Snowflake Inc.'s (NYSE:SNOW) ability to manage massive amounts of data with NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU-accelerated computing and NeMo platform, which develops large language models (LLMs), the partnership will help businesses use their data to make custom LLMs for generative AI services. These include AI chatbots like ChatGPT and search and summarization services as well.Another AI deal in the spotlight today is Thomson Reuters Corporation's (NYSE:TRI) $650 million acquisition of Castext, a company that develops AI-powered legal workflows. Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) is aiming to make generative AI solutions available to its customers through this deal. Another AI deal that has become the talk of the markets is the Databricks acquisition of MosaicML for $1.3 billion. Through MosaicML, you can train and deploy LLMs and other generative AI models in your data in a secure environment. MosaicML has been considered a rival to OpenAI, meaning that with this acquisition, Databricks has also joined the generative AI race.Story continues""Pioneers Need To Be Willing To Be Misunderstood For Long Periods Of Time""CNBC showed on June 22 that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also announced a $100 million program through which it hopes to help its customers use generative AI. The markets have been viewing Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a lagger in the generative AI space so far, so this move may seem to some as a way to rectify this image. The company may be attempting to mark its own territory within this space by signaling to other big tech competitors that it is now working to bring generative AI tools and models to its cloud customers through Amazon Web Services. Here are some comments on this move from Adam Selipsky, the CEO of Amazon Web Services:""The reality of it is that Amazon has been working on artificial intelligence, as mentioned earlier, for longer than almost any of these companies. We have long accumulated experience, we have many, many experts, thousands of practioners of different kinds inside the company. Many of those experts are now working specifically on generative AI. Nobody else has the full stack of capabilities that we're putting together.""Selipsky also mentioned in his CNBC interview that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is now also working on developing its own ""machine learning, AI-specific chips"" alongside several other projects within the AI space. It was noted that other companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have been receiving more recognition on Wall Street for their AI contributions, particularly in generative AI, to which Selipsky responded that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a saying which goes ""pioneers have to be willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time."" He elaborated on this by saying that the company has many past examples which show that it was more focused on its customers and building what they want, adding that if that led to misconceptions about the company's trajectory, that was alright, as long as its customers understood where it was going. In light of this, Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) move to make generative AI available to its customers now may begin to make more sense to Wall Street as this shows how the company is once again trying its best to meet customer needs.The above-mentioned deals, acquisitions, and programs highlight how many companies are trying to enter the generative AI race by partnering with other companies using generative AI. We have elaborated on more of these companies below in our list to show which generative AI stocks the markets should be watching today.10 Stocks Jumping On The Generative AI WagonPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyWe have selected stocks that have recently been making moves to join the AI sector, particularly the generative AI area, for our list below. We used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter to rank these stocks from the lowest to the highest number of hedge funds holding stakes in them.Stocks Jumping On The Generative AI Wagon10. Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) is a research and consulting services company based in Toronto, Canada. The company provides business information services internationally.This June, Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) agreed to acquire Casetext for $650 million. Casetext is a legal AI company that develops AI-powered legal workflows. Steve Hasker, the CEO of Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) commented that this acquisition would be part of the company's ""build, partner, and buy strategy"" through which it can bring generative AI solutions to its customers.There were 16 hedge funds long Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $144 million.Tim Casey, an analyst at BMO Capital, maintains an Outperform rating on Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) as of June 28. The analyst also raised his price target from $184 to $192.Junto Capital Management was the largest shareholder in Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) at the end of the first quarter, holding 268,335 shares in the company.9. C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Our hedge fund data for the first quarter shows 24 funds holding stakes in C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI). Their total stake value in the company was $151 million.C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) is an information technology company based in Redwood City, California. The company has developed a new enterprise search tool powered by language models similar to those powering ChatGPT. C3.ai, Inc.'s (NYSE:AI) search bar retrieves answers from an organization's own knowledge base and can summarize this information while also citing its sources.On June 1, Daniel Ives at Wedbush upgraded C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) shares from Neutral to Outperform while also raising his price target on the stock from $24 to $50.Kerrisdale Capital mentioned C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) in its March investor letter:“We are short shares of C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), a $4 billion market capitalization enterprise software company that has risen from the ashes of its busted IPO based on the misconception that its self-proclaimed “AI leadership” somehow positions it to benefit from Silicon Valley’s current tech theme du jour: generative AI as represented by media obsession ChatGPT. We believe these speculative flames won’t burn bright much longer, as the realities of C3’s poor customer traction, failing sales partnerships, and financial pressures will catalyze what is likely to be a painful reality check.This isn’t the first time C3 has sought to ride a hot investment theme. The company was originally founded as C3 Energy to develop analytics solutions for public utilities preparing for the emergence of cap-and-trade and smart grids. C3 pivoted in 2016, renaming the company C3 IoT to capitalize on that buzzy opportunity. But management’s master stroke was rebranding operations as C3.ai in 2019 and going public with the “AI” stock ticker, thus securing its place as the default artificial intelligence stock play for the undiscriminating investor despite the bulk of its business coming from relatively dated analytics models built for a very small number of utility, energy, and government customers. C3 is a minor, cash-burning consulting and services business masquerading as a software company, and its true value is a fraction of its current market capitalization…” (Click here to read the full text)C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), like Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), is a stock that might see more upside because of its involvement in generative AI.8. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Credit Suisse analyst Shannon Cross reiterated an Outperform rating on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) on June 26 alongside a $162 price target.Citadel Investment Group held 3.1 million shares in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) at the end of the first quarter, making it the most prominent shareholder in the company for that quarter.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is another information technology company on our list. It is based in Armonk, New York. The company launched a new generative AI platform, Watsonx, this May for businesses. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) believes Watsonx can help businesses manage their own AI-supported data while ensuring their data is secure and in compliance with regulatory and ethical requirements.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was spotted in the portfolios of 49 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $1.5 billion.7. Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60In June, Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN), an information technology company, acquired Flutura, an industrial AI company based in India, to help boost its own industrial AI services.

In order to fund the purchase of, and subsequent addition to, Teleperformance, we modestly trimmed our positions in Aon and Accenture. We trimmed our weighting in Aon, though it remains a top three weighting in the Portfolio. We believed there was room to trim the position after significant relative outperformance by the stock in 2022. There is no change to our positive outlook for this business. We also trimmed our weighting in Accenture, our second trim in the past four months, as the company returns to a normal growth trajectory after an extended stretch of robust results brought about by the pandemic. In addition to growth normalizing, we see increased signs of slowing enterprise tech spending. We continue to believe Accenture is well positioned to grow in line with historical performance, meaning we see the business producing low-double digit total return growth from here.”Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN), like Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), is a stock to watch in light of generative AI developments.6. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61On June 30, Jim Suva at Citigroup initiated coverage on Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) with a Neutral rating and a $54 price target.In the first quarter, 61 hedge funds were long Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO).

You can skip our detailed analysis of the stock market and returns of NASDAQ, and go directly to read 5 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks to Buy. Since the start of 2023, the stock market has witnessed a significant shift in direction, marked by a noteworthy recovery in major indices. Most Wall Street investors believe that stocks have entered a new phase of a bull market, characterized by rising prices and positive market sentiment. Additionally, they express confidence that the U.S. economy will manage to avoid a recession in 2023, according to a survey conducted by CNBC Delivering Alpha in the last week of June.The major stock exchanges concluded the first half of the year on a highly positive note, with the tech-heavy NASDAQ emerging as the frontrunner among them. The index returned 32.7% year-to-date, which marked its biggest increase during the first half of the year since 1983 when it rose by 37%. In addition to this, the combined value of companies in the Nasdaq 100 has surged by nearly $5 trillion this year so far, as reported by Fortune. One of the main reasons for this rally is a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI chatbots. Fortune reported that the surge in AI-related investments is being compared to the dot-com bubble of 2000 when the market got influenced by a limited number of tech stocks before experiencing a crash. The market's strong interest in generative AI has overshadowed major concerns that could have negatively impacted sentiment this year. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are reporting strong gains this year, after declining massively in 2022.Historical data indicates that the second half of the year tends to be favorable for NASDAQ due to heightened economic activity. This period often sees increased consumer spending, business expansion, and overall economic growth, which can positively impact the performance of companies listed on the NASDAQ. According to a report by Forbes, from July 1 to December 31, NASDAQ has historically gained an average of 7.8%, compared to an average increase of 3.2% during the first six months of the year.Story continuesAlso read: How to Play The AI Boom And NASDAQ RallyAnalysts also believe that the tech rally will continue for the foreseeable future and is not expected to end anytime soon. This suggests that there is ongoing optimism surrounding the performance and potential of technology companies. Bryn Talkington, a managing partner at Requisite Capital Management, spoke about tech stocks this year in his interview with CNBC’s “Closing Bell”. He said:“I think you’re going to continue to see tech dominate because we’re still all abuzz about AI.”Similarly, Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, also presented a bullish outlook for the tech sector in the second half of the year. In his interview with Bloomberg, he stated:“I still do like big tech. I do believe in technology continuing to reinvent itself — obviously with the latest addition being AI.

If you want to skip our industry analysis and introduction to the top players, head on over to 5 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Buy. Machine learning is a technology that is right at the heart of 2023's technological revolution. Over the past couple of decades, we have seen several technological products such as semiconductors, personal computing devices, and the Internet revolutionize both business and public life. Now, it's time for machine learning to shine since it is one of the applications of artificial intelligence - the hottest technology these days.Artificial intelligence has also played a crucial role in the stock market this year. The current rally in artificial intelligence started when ChatGPT made waves on the internet and impressed users with its ability to generate life like responses. This injected fresh optimism into the shares of firms that are directly linked to Open AI. These include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs) are responsible for powering Chat GPT and training the artificial intelligence platform. And these products are made by TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer.As a whole, the largest shareholders of AI related firms have profited quite a bit from artificial intelligence stocks. These have cumulatively led to billionaires such as Larry Ellison of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) adding $150 billion to their wealth. NVIDIA's shares are up by a whopping 195% year to date and the firm is the only semiconductor company that is currently worth more than a trillion dollars on the stock market. Meta, which faced a bloodbath on the stock market last year after its chief Mark Zuckerberg plowed billions of dollars into the metaverse, also saw some much needed love. Its shares are up by 130% year to date, lending it a market value of $735 billion.Story continuesThe investor attention on machine learning is not without reason either, especially when we consider the market value and growth rates of the industry. For instance, a report from Fortune Business Insights outlines that the market is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.8% between 2022 and 2029 to grow from an initial $21 billion at 2023 end to $210 billion by the end of the forecast period. Similarly, a report from Market Research Future also has a 38.8% CAGR for a value of $106 billion by 2030.So what are the top players in the machine learning market doing these days? Well, NVIDIA made a big but silent move in February this year when it acquired the machine learning startup OmniML. OmniML is a software company that develops software to speed up the machine learning process. Machine learning requires programmers and others to train models before the models are able to generate insights. OmniML automates this entire process to streamline the development process and enable quicker deployment of machine learning models. NVIDIA also has its own resources that enable developers to leverage and use machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. It partnered up with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in May 2023 to use the latter's Azure machine learning platform for providing products and services to users for rapidly deploying these networks.Another key player in the machine learning industry is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Alphabet has massive computing resources at its disposal, allowing it to develop numerous models for countless different use cases such as search engine queries. Another use case that is seeing attention from Google is money laundering. Announced in June 2023, the new platform uses machine learning to create a customer risk score to lower costs, improve risk detection, and provide a better customer experience. The anti money laundering platform has also been employed by HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) and Banco Bradesco S.A. (NYSE:BBD), with the former reporting as much as a fourfold increase in recognizing suspicious activity and a 60% reduction in alert volumes.Yet, as big as Google is, anti money laundering is just one of the ways in which it is utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence. During the firm's first quarter of 2023 earnings call, its chief Mr. Sundar Pichai shared:And as we continue to bring AI to our products, our AI principles and the highest standards of information integrity remain at the core of all our work.As one example, our perspective API helps to identify and reduce the amount of toxic text that language models train on with significant benefits for information quality. This is designed to help ensure the safety of generative AI applications before they are released to the public.We are proud to have world-class research teams who have been advancing the breakthroughs underpinning this new era of AI. Last week, I announced that we are bringing together the Brain Team in Google Research and DeepMind into one unit. Combining all this talent into 1 focused team, backed by the pooled computational resources of Google, will help accelerate our progress and develop the most capable AI systems safely and responsibly.On to my second theme, the company’s sharpened focus.I spoke last quarter about our commitment to invest responsibly and with discipline and to find areas where we can operate more cost effectively and with greater velocity. We have significant multiyear efforts underway to create savings, such as improving machine utilization and finding more scalable and efficient ways to train and serve machine learning models. We are making our data centers more efficient, redistributing workloads and equipment where servers aren’t being fully used. This is important work as we continue to significantly invest in infrastructure to drive our many AI opportunities. Improving external procurement is another area where data suggests significant savings, and this work is underway. And we are taking concrete steps to manage our real estate portfolio to ensure it meets our current and future needs.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the best machine learning stocks that are being favored by hedge funds. Som top machine learning stock picks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).12 Best Machine Learning Stocks To BuyOur MethodologyTo make our list of the best machine learning stocks, we first compiled a list of all companies that either provide the hardware for machine learning or have significant products that are based on the technology.

The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 10.8% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 12.2%. McKesson’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 4.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcKesson is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its robust Biologics business. The optimism led by a solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and its strength in the distribution market are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trends persist.Let’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversStrength in Biologics: Investors are optimistic about McKesson’s robust Biologics business. Independent specialty pharmacy, Biologics by McKesson, has been making impressive progress lately. In April, the pharmacy was selected by Reata Pharmaceuticals as the sole specialty pharmacy provider for SKYCLARYS (omaveloxolone), the first and only treatment for Friedreich’s ataxia.In February, the pharmacy was selected by Lilly as a specialty pharmacy provider for JAYPIRCA (pirtobrutinib) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma after at least two lines of systemic therapy, including a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor.Strength in Distribution Market: McKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market, which raises investors’ optimism. The Distribution Solutions segment caters to a wide range of customers and businesses and stands to benefit from increased generic utilization, inflation in generics driven by several patent expirations in the next few years and an aging population.Story continuesPer the fiscal fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call in May, the company’s U.S. and international distribution businesses continued to play a key role in the pandemic response. Strong Q4 Results: McKesson’s robust fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy optimism. The company recorded robust top-line and bottom-line performances and strength in its U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments.DownsidesWeak Trends: McKesson distributes generic pharmaceuticals, which are subject to price fluctuation. The Distribution Solutions segment continues to experience weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trends. Continued volatility, unfavorable pricing trends, reimbursement of generic drugs and significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches could have a material adverse impact on McKesson.Stiff Competition: Distribution Solutions faces stiff competition both in terms of price and service from various full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large-payer organizations. Moreover, the company depends on fewer suppliers for its products. As a result, it is not in a position to negotiate pricing.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, HealthEquity, Inc. HQY and Boston Scientific Corporation BSX.Hologic, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 5.1% for fiscal 2024.

(AP) — Fans who agree Disneyland is indeed the happiest place on Earth will soon be able to take home more than a souvenir.A passionate collector has brought Disney magic to a sprawling 30,000-square-foot (2,800-square-meter) building in Burbank, California, where fans can hear birds chirping in the Enchanted Tiki Room section or giggle at the animated ghosts from the Haunted Mansion ride as they preview more than 1,500 items up for auction later this month.Joel Magee has been building his collection of more than 6,000 items — including costumes, rare posters, and life-size vehicles from rides like Dumbo and Peter Pan — for 30 years, and he’s finally ready to share some of it with the public.“I’m one of those guys — go big or go home. And if you don’t have the biggest, then it ain’t the best,” Magee told The Associated Press in a recent interview, as fans milled about the exhibit. Magee’s is the largest individually owned Disneyland/Disney Park collection in the world.“It’s really kind of exciting. This is the first time that all of my things have been in the same room at the same time,” he said.Magee is known in the collectible industry as “the toy scout,” and has amassed a huge collection of toys and Disney items. He says he watched “The Wonderful World of Disney” on TV every week as a kid but had never been to the park and never thought about collecting until he was at a toy show where he met a man selling Disneyland artifacts and got hooked.“At the time, I couldn’t afford too much. I bought a couple of pieces, but that’s where it all began,” Magee said. “In my travels as ‘the toy scout,’ I meet people all over the country and for the last 25 years, they’ve just been bringing me all their stuff and here it is today.”The items for sale are as small as a trading card and as large as a 1917 Model T moving van from Disneyland’s original Main Street that Magee says Walt Disney created himself.Mike Van Eaton is the co-owner of Van Eaton Galleries, which is running the auction. He says among the most sought-after items are those from the Haunted Mansion attraction, including original stretch paintings from the elevator in the iconic ride, and a “doom buggy” — the vehicle guests ride on.Story continues“Joel also has one of the most amazing Disney attraction poster collections in the world. He has every attraction poster ever in the park. And those are also going to do very well,” Van Eaton said.There are items for every price point, with some starting as low as $50 — but most go way up from there.“Some of these items, such as the Dumbo ride vehicle, may go for $200,000 to $300,000. We have trash cans from the park that may go for $5,000 or $6,000, and posters that could reach $50,000 to $60,000,” Van Eaton said.Magee says it’s hard to choose his favorites in such a large collection but he is partial to the static props he's brought to life.“The Tiki birds, oh my gosh, they were piles of junk when we got them! They were worn out, pieces were missing,” Magee said. “Some good friends of mine that do a lot of work … in that field brought them all back to life better than you could ever imagine. And … people look at that and you can just see the magic in their eyes when they see them.”The exhibition is at the Burbank Town Center Mall and runs through July 16. The auction will be held July 17 through 19.___Lefferts reported from New York.]"

178,a80730f0-ab19-378b-a378-41b993d751f8,JNPR,2023-07-04,3 Wireless Stocks Set to Ride on Solid Consumer Demand Trends,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-wireless-stocks-set-ride-154200029.html,1688398920,STORY,"['IDCC', 'JNPR', '^GSPC']","[The Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is likely to benefit from healthy demand trends with an accelerated pace of 5G deployment and fiber network infrastructure upgrade. However, large-scale investments to support the 5G transition, margin erosion due to price wars, higher customer inventory levels and inflated raw material costs amid a challenging macroeconomic environment and supply chain adversities might erode profitability.Nevertheless, Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR, Viasat, Inc. VSAT and InterDigital Inc. IDCC are expected to profit from the increasing demand for state-of-the-art wireless products with a vast proliferation of IoT, fiber densification and a gradual shift to cloud services.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry primarily comprises companies that provide various networking solutions, wireless telecom products and related services for wireless voice and data communications through scalable modular platforms. Their product portfolio encompasses integrated circuit devices (chips) and system software for wireless voice and data communications, analog and digital two-way radio, satellite telecommunications, wireless networking and signal processing, and end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions. The firms also provide a broad range of routing, switching and security products, video surveillance and machine-to-machine communication components that secure VPN appliances, enable intrusion detection and thwart data theft. Some firms even provide electronic warfare, avionics, robotics, advanced communications and maritime systems to the defense industry.What's Shaping the Future of the Wireless Equipment Industry?Wide Proliferation of IoT: With the exponential growth of mobile broadband traffic and home Internet solutions, demand for advanced networking architecture has increased manifold. This has forced service providers to spend more on routers and switches to upgrade their networks and support the surge in home data traffic. To maintain superior performance standards, there is a continuous need for network tuning and optimization, which creates demand for state-of-the-art wireless products and services. Moreover, a faster pace of 5G deployment is expected to augment the scalability, security and universal mobility of the telecommunications industry and propel the wide proliferation of IoT. Expansion of fiber optic networks by carriers to support their 4G LTE and 5G wireless standards, as well as wireline connections, are likely to act as tailwinds. The fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and the last mile local loop, which are required by wireless service providers for 5G deployment. The industry participants are facilitating its customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations and seamlessly migrate to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation through steady infrastructure investments.Short-Term Profitability at Stake: Although higher infrastructure investments will eventually help minimize service delivery costs to support broadband competition and wireless densification, short-term profitability has largely been compromised. Margins are likely to be affected by the high cost of first-generation 5G products, profitability challenges in China, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and pricing pressure in early 5G deals. Uncertainty regarding chip shortage and supply-chain disruptions leading to a dearth of essential fiber materials, shipping delays and shortages of other raw materials are expected to affect the expansion and rollout of new broadband networks. Extended lead times for basic components are also likely to hurt the delivery schedule and escalate production costs. Further, the high technological obsolescence of most products has escalated operating costs with steady investments in R&amp;D. High customer inventory levels owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment and intense market volatility remain another headwind for the companies.Transition to Cloud Services: The majority of the industry participants offer mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software and services that enable its customers to run businesses with increased efficiency and safety for their mobile workforce. These systems drive demand for additional device sales, software upgrades, infrastructure overhaul and expansion, as well as additional services to maintain, monitor and manage these complex networks and solutions. The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks for constant critical communication operations. The wide proliferation of cloud networking solutions is further resulting in increased storage and computing on a virtual plane. As both consumers and enterprises use the network, there is tremendous demand for quality networking equipment.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish ProspectsThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector.

180,3f0c22b2-e852-36ca-8f0e-c1cf48eaeb66,CMCSA,2023-07-04,Can Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Improve Its Returns?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-corporation-nasdaq-cmcsa-improve-140031364.html,1688392831,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Comcast is:6.3% = US$5.2b ÷ US$83b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.06 in profit.Does Comcast Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Comcast has a lower ROE than the average (12%) in the Media industry classification.roeThat's not what we like to see. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. You can see the 3 risks we have identified for Comcast by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesComcast's Debt And Its 6.3% ROEComcast does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.21. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

If you want to skip our industry analysis and introduction to the top players, head on over to 5 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Buy. Machine learning is a technology that is right at the heart of 2023's technological revolution. Over the past couple of decades, we have seen several technological products such as semiconductors, personal computing devices, and the Internet revolutionize both business and public life. Now, it's time for machine learning to shine since it is one of the applications of artificial intelligence - the hottest technology these days.Artificial intelligence has also played a crucial role in the stock market this year. The current rally in artificial intelligence started when ChatGPT made waves on the internet and impressed users with its ability to generate life like responses. This injected fresh optimism into the shares of firms that are directly linked to Open AI. These include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs) are responsible for powering Chat GPT and training the artificial intelligence platform. And these products are made by TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer.As a whole, the largest shareholders of AI related firms have profited quite a bit from artificial intelligence stocks. These have cumulatively led to billionaires such as Larry Ellison of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) adding $150 billion to their wealth. NVIDIA's shares are up by a whopping 195% year to date and the firm is the only semiconductor company that is currently worth more than a trillion dollars on the stock market. Meta, which faced a bloodbath on the stock market last year after its chief Mark Zuckerberg plowed billions of dollars into the metaverse, also saw some much needed love. Its shares are up by 130% year to date, lending it a market value of $735 billion.Story continuesThe investor attention on machine learning is not without reason either, especially when we consider the market value and growth rates of the industry. For instance, a report from Fortune Business Insights outlines that the market is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.8% between 2022 and 2029 to grow from an initial $21 billion at 2023 end to $210 billion by the end of the forecast period. Similarly, a report from Market Research Future also has a 38.8% CAGR for a value of $106 billion by 2030.So what are the top players in the machine learning market doing these days? Well, NVIDIA made a big but silent move in February this year when it acquired the machine learning startup OmniML. OmniML is a software company that develops software to speed up the machine learning process. Machine learning requires programmers and others to train models before the models are able to generate insights. OmniML automates this entire process to streamline the development process and enable quicker deployment of machine learning models. NVIDIA also has its own resources that enable developers to leverage and use machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. It partnered up with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in May 2023 to use the latter's Azure machine learning platform for providing products and services to users for rapidly deploying these networks.Another key player in the machine learning industry is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Alphabet has massive computing resources at its disposal, allowing it to develop numerous models for countless different use cases such as search engine queries. Another use case that is seeing attention from Google is money laundering. Announced in June 2023, the new platform uses machine learning to create a customer risk score to lower costs, improve risk detection, and provide a better customer experience. The anti money laundering platform has also been employed by HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) and Banco Bradesco S.A. (NYSE:BBD), with the former reporting as much as a fourfold increase in recognizing suspicious activity and a 60% reduction in alert volumes.Yet, as big as Google is, anti money laundering is just one of the ways in which it is utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence. During the firm's first quarter of 2023 earnings call, its chief Mr. Sundar Pichai shared:And as we continue to bring AI to our products, our AI principles and the highest standards of information integrity remain at the core of all our work.As one example, our perspective API helps to identify and reduce the amount of toxic text that language models train on with significant benefits for information quality. This is designed to help ensure the safety of generative AI applications before they are released to the public.We are proud to have world-class research teams who have been advancing the breakthroughs underpinning this new era of AI.

We have significant multiyear efforts underway to create savings, such as improving machine utilization and finding more scalable and efficient ways to train and serve machine learning models. We are making our data centers more efficient, redistributing workloads and equipment where servers aren’t being fully used. This is important work as we continue to significantly invest in infrastructure to drive our many AI opportunities. Improving external procurement is another area where data suggests significant savings, and this work is underway. And we are taking concrete steps to manage our real estate portfolio to ensure it meets our current and future needs.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the best machine learning stocks that are being favored by hedge funds.

187,2c6bd9c3-af49-35a0-a8d4-05305d3cfa15,FIS,2023-07-04,Exclusive-GTCR nears up to $20 billion FIS merchant business deal-sources,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-gtcr-nears-20-billion-223459314.html,1688423699,STORY,['FIS'],"[By Anirban Sen, David French and Milana VinnNEW YORK (Reuters) -Private equity firm GTCR LLC is in advanced talks to acquire a majority stake in the merchant business of payment processing company Fidelity National Information Services Inc in a deal that values the division at between $15 billion and $20 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.The deal would be the largest in GTCR's history and enable FIS to undo its soured $43 billion acquisition of Worldpay in 2019. Worldpay comprises the bulk of the FIS merchant business, which processes payments for companies.GTCR's offer prevailed over Advent International, another buyout firm that was also vying for the business, the sources said. If the negotiations conclude successfully in the coming days, FIS plans to keep a minority stake in the business, the sources said.GTCR plans to finance half of the deal through equity financing and half through borrowing, two of the sources said. The sources requested anonymity and cautioned that deal talks could still collapse at the last minute.GTCR, FIS and Advent declined to comment.Such a large leveraged buyout would be a bright spot as expensive and scarcer debt financing and economic uncertainty weigh on dealmaking. Private equity-led buyouts in the first half of 2023 totaled $196.7 billion, down 59% from the year-ago period, Dealogic data shows.FIS shares closed 6% higher at $58, valuing the company at $34 billion, after the Financial Times reported that buyout groups were weighing buying a majority stake in Worldpay.Several conglomerates, including General Electric Co, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Kellogg Co and Toshiba Corp, have broken up their sprawling businesses over the past few years as investors pushed for leaner operations and enhanced profitability in some of the core businesses.FIS's breakup would leave it with a core processing systems business, enabling transactions among banks and other financial institutions, as well as its capital markets division serving investment firms.Story continuesFIS launched a strategic review of its operations in December following pressure from hedge funds D.E. Shaw and Jana Partners. Reuters was first to report in February that FIS was preparing to shed its merchants business.FIS, based in Jacksonville, Florida, said at the time it would pursue a tax-free spin-off of its merchant business and disclosed a $17.6 billion write-down related to its Worldpay acquisition. Analysts have cited under-investment and operational missteps for its unsuccessful integration of Worldpay.FIS, which started in 1968 and serves big financial services corporations, has cut thousands of jobs since the review began. It plans to cut costs by $1.25 billion in its broader revamp.The merchants business accounts for about 30% of the company's revenue, while FIS's banking technology arm constitutes about 46%, and capital markets the remainder.Chicago-based GTCR manages more than $35 billion in assets and invests across sectors, including financial services. In May, GTCR raised its largest buyout fund ever, collecting $11.5 billion from investors.GTCR's previous financial technology deals include buying mortgage software firm Optimal Blue and selling it to Black Knight Inc in 2020 for $1.8 billion. It also bought Global Claims Service in 2021, which supports property and casualty insurers in handling claims.(Reporting by Anirban Sen, David French and Milana Vinn in New York; Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Richard Chang)]"

The private entities are looking for an opportunity to purchase a majority stake in the Worldpay unit.Per the report, a potential bid might put a valuation of more than $15 billion for the unit. The entities looking to offer a suitable bid include the private equity investor, Advent, which was part of a consortium that owned the payments provider business earlier. The Chicago-based private equity company, GTCR, is also expected to be on the list of potential buyers.This February, Fidelity National announced that it was planning to spin off its Merchant Solutions business, which includes the Worldpay business. FIS stated that the tax-free spin-off would create more value for shareholders. The Merchant Solutions unit contributed 32.9% to revenues last year. Fidelity National bought Worldpay in 2019 through a deal valued at around $43 billion, including debt.The idea of a spin-off surfaced during an assessment of Fidelity National’s business, operations, strategy and structure. FIS expects the move to improve both the companies’ performances and simplify operations. The company plans to maintain a commercial relationship following the move.In the first quarter, Merchant Solutions’ revenues were recorded at $1,105 million, which dropped 1% year over year. However, organic revenue growth came in at 2%. The adjusted EBITDA margin deteriorated 350 bps year over year to 43.5% in the first quarter due to a lower-margin revenue mix. Following the separation, the unit is likely to be named Worldpay.Price PerformanceShares of Fidelity have rallied 3.3% in the past three months compared with the 5.1% rise of the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksFidelity currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Thank you mom and dad for the genes (and thanks Ulta's COO for the skin cream recommendation).Two, Overstock.com purchased Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's website and will change its name to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. I personally would never want to be associated with failure and bad vibes — yet here is Overstock going all in on both.I wish the team there well in trying to walk around in a zombie's skin.morning brief imageAnd lastly, I — along with investors I have chatted up — have been surprised by the performance of most restaurant stocks. That's across the board from fast food plays such as McDonald's to sit-down eateries in the mold of Olive Garden owner Darden.Everything but the kitchen sink has been tossed at restaurant companies and their stocks this year.Slowing GDP growth has taken hold, which usually doesn't translate to strong financial results from restaurants. Rising menu prices have consumers thinking twice about a family dinner out on the town.Higher average hourly earnings for waiters, waitresses, and back-of-house staff are weighing on profits. Inflation has hit everybody.And of course, much higher interest rates make putting 10 orders of pizza from Papa John's after a kid's sports game on a credit card adds another expensive wrinkle.Even the infatuation with AI stocks serving to suck investment dollars from other sectors in the market could be viewed as a headwind.Yet here we stand, with most restaurant stocks doing quite well for the year. Restaurant sales as sourced by the Census Bureau have trended higher in recent months. As you can see in our nifty infographic, same-store sales for most major chain restaurants strengthened in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 2022.Story continuesMcDonald's, for example, saw higher sales in the first quarter on the back of higher menu prices and guest counts.Winning recipe.Veteran restaurant analyst Danilo Gargiulo at Bernstein tells me there are at least three reasons behind the moves in the stocks and the financial resilience:""Restaurants are an affordable luxury: even if consumers’ wallets are more squeezed, the typical spending reduction occurs among durable goods and large ticket items first; reduction in spending at restaurants is the last resort.Unemployment rate is still low. The biggest negative impact on restaurant demand comes from reducing disposable income and increasing unemployment rate. Consumer sentiment and future outlook matter, but only marginally. Today we are still enjoying healthy employment rates in the United States, favoring restaurants’ demand.Restaurant prices have grown less than grocery prices. The relative inflation of food at home (i.e. grocery) vs food away from home (restaurants) has once more favored restaurants’ demand, given that the pricing actions taken by restaurants have been significantly more moderate vs the price increases at the average grocery.""Another ingredient (and one Fed chief Jay Powell could eat up) at play is inflation that is finally cooling.""There’s a line of sight to lower inflation/less margin pressure,"" Bank of America restaurant analyst Sara Senatore tells me of the appetite to own restaurant stocks in 2023So can these stocks continue to cook up the surprising gains?Maybe, but the second half headwinds will be almost as formidable as the first half, pros say. Chief among them is potentially a next leg down in economic growth and two more interest rate hikes from the Fed.""The group is heading into any potential slowdown in much better shape than perhaps any prior US recessions,"" one long-time restaurant analyst remarked to me.Somewhat reassuring.The pros think it's best to remain with best-in-breed names rather than bet on turnaround stories.""We believe that Yum! Brands and Wendy’s will continue to have positive momentum in the second half of the year, but we expect Chipotle and Darden to provide the greatest returns, as they directly operate their stores and can capture the upside from more moderate commodity inflation,"" Bernstein's Gargiulo says.Chew on that.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

195,7317f7b6-b90b-3f99-bb26-66f1f773a453,MCD,2023-07-04,McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) shareholders have earned a 16% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonalds-nyse-mcd-shareholders-earned-110035041.html,1688468435,STORY,['MCD'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) shareholders have enjoyed a 84% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 51% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 19% , including dividends .So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for McDonald's While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, McDonald's achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 7.1% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on McDonald's' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for McDonald's the TSR over the last 5 years was 107%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that McDonald's shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 19% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 16%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for McDonald's that you should be aware of before investing here.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Thank you mom and dad for the genes (and thanks Ulta's COO for the skin cream recommendation).Two, Overstock.com purchased Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's website and will change its name to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. I personally would never want to be associated with failure and bad vibes — yet here is Overstock going all in on both.I wish the team there well in trying to walk around in a zombie's skin.morning brief imageAnd lastly, I — along with investors I have chatted up — have been surprised by the performance of most restaurant stocks. That's across the board from fast food plays such as McDonald's to sit-down eateries in the mold of Olive Garden owner Darden.Everything but the kitchen sink has been tossed at restaurant companies and their stocks this year.Slowing GDP growth has taken hold, which usually doesn't translate to strong financial results from restaurants. Rising menu prices have consumers thinking twice about a family dinner out on the town.Higher average hourly earnings for waiters, waitresses, and back-of-house staff are weighing on profits. Inflation has hit everybody.And of course, much higher interest rates make putting 10 orders of pizza from Papa John's after a kid's sports game on a credit card adds another expensive wrinkle.Even the infatuation with AI stocks serving to suck investment dollars from other sectors in the market could be viewed as a headwind.Yet here we stand, with most restaurant stocks doing quite well for the year. Restaurant sales as sourced by the Census Bureau have trended higher in recent months. As you can see in our nifty infographic, same-store sales for most major chain restaurants strengthened in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 2022.Story continuesMcDonald's, for example, saw higher sales in the first quarter on the back of higher menu prices and guest counts.Winning recipe.Veteran restaurant analyst Danilo Gargiulo at Bernstein tells me there are at least three reasons behind the moves in the stocks and the financial resilience:""Restaurants are an affordable luxury: even if consumers’ wallets are more squeezed, the typical spending reduction occurs among durable goods and large ticket items first; reduction in spending at restaurants is the last resort.Unemployment rate is still low. The biggest negative impact on restaurant demand comes from reducing disposable income and increasing unemployment rate. Consumer sentiment and future outlook matter, but only marginally. Today we are still enjoying healthy employment rates in the United States, favoring restaurants’ demand.Restaurant prices have grown less than grocery prices. The relative inflation of food at home (i.e. grocery) vs food away from home (restaurants) has once more favored restaurants’ demand, given that the pricing actions taken by restaurants have been significantly more moderate vs the price increases at the average grocery.""Another ingredient (and one Fed chief Jay Powell could eat up) at play is inflation that is finally cooling.""There’s a line of sight to lower inflation/less margin pressure,"" Bank of America restaurant analyst Sara Senatore tells me of the appetite to own restaurant stocks in 2023So can these stocks continue to cook up the surprising gains?Maybe, but the second half headwinds will be almost as formidable as the first half, pros say. Chief among them is potentially a next leg down in economic growth and two more interest rate hikes from the Fed.""The group is heading into any potential slowdown in much better shape than perhaps any prior US recessions,"" one long-time restaurant analyst remarked to me.Somewhat reassuring.The pros think it's best to remain with best-in-breed names rather than bet on turnaround stories.""We believe that Yum! Brands and Wendy’s will continue to have positive momentum in the second half of the year, but we expect Chipotle and Darden to provide the greatest returns, as they directly operate their stores and can capture the upside from more moderate commodity inflation,"" Bernstein's Gargiulo says.Chew on that.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

198,f0a2388d-570c-39cb-bde2-b97300618ca1,PCAR,2023-07-04,"Is Paccar (PCAR) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think ""Yes""",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paccar-pcar-solid-growth-stock-164506709.html,1688402706,STORY,['PCAR'],"[Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Paccar (PCAR) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this truck maker a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Paccar is 4.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 36.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 7%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Paccar has an S/TA ratio of 0.95, which means that the company gets $0.95 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.38, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Paccar looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 15.6% this year versus the industry average of 11%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Paccar have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Paccar a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Paccar well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

199,db0d8e56-ffdd-3e11-b65c-735ba46a4302,PCAR,2023-07-04,Are Investors Undervaluing PACCAR (PCAR) Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-paccar-pcar-now-134012461.html,1688391612,STORY,['PCAR'],"[Here at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks. Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value.PCAR is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.16. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PCAR's industry currently sports an average PEG of 2.92. Over the past 52 weeks, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.32 and as low as 0.94, with a median of 1.15.Investors should also recognize that PCAR has a P/B ratio of 3.11. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 5.14. Over the past year, PCAR's P/B has been as high as 3.11 and as low as 2.20, with a median of 2.69.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. PCAR has a P/S ratio of 1.42. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.96.Story continuesFinally, our model also underscores that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 11.24. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 21.42. Over the past year, PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 11.24 and as low as 8.57, with a median of 9.98.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that PACCAR is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, PCAR feels like a great value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

202,c3143779-f369-3c7f-a1ee-458d943e7cc8,UPS,2023-07-04,MicroStrategy and Arch Resources have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microstrategy-arch-resources-highlighted-zacks-111300138.html,1688382780,STORY,"['MSTR', 'ARCH', 'FDX', '^GSPC', 'UPS']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – July 3, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares MicroStrategy Inc. MSTR as the Bull of the Day and Arch Resources Inc. ARCH as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on FedEx Corporation FDX and United Parcel Service, Inc. UPS.Here is a synopsis of all four stocks:Bull of the Day:Company OverviewZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock MicroStrategy Inc. is a software company that specializes in business intelligence (BI) and analytics. MicroStrategy provides a comprehensive platform that enables organizations to analyze and visualize their data to make informed business decisions. The company's tools allow for data discovery and exploration, interactive dashboards, data visualization, and reporting capabilities. Before its initial public offering (IPO) in 1998, MicroStrategy signed its most prominent client, the fast-food giant McDonald's.Adopting the ""Bitcoin Standard""For years, Michael Saylor had been concerned that the monetary system has been expanding by approximately 7% per year while inflation tends to rise at a clip of about 2% annually. In late 2020, Michael Saylor, MSTR's founder and CEO at the time (now Executive Chairman), decided to take action and adopt what he refers to as the ""Bitcoin Standard.""Michael Saylor, who is an eccentric MIT graduate, entrepreneur, and business executive, became fascinated with the uniqueness of Bitcoin and saw it as an alternative to the current monetary system. During an interview, Saylor reasoned, ""What we (MSTR) were doing was that we were inverting the balance sheet such that we're floating on a Bitcoin sail, on a crypto sail, if you will, and as the liquidity and the monetary system gets pumped up, we want it to float, rather than sink, on that pool of liquidity"". A lot has changed since Saylor's initial Bitcoin-inspired epiphany. MSTR now owns more than 140,000 Bitcoin worth roughly $4 billion. In other words, MSTR has morphed into a Bitcoin proxy – which is not necessarily a bad thing. Despite Bitcoin being well off its all-time highs and the ""crypto winter"", MSTR has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 handsomely in the past five years.Story continuesThe Narrative Is ChangingLike any new idea, Bitcoin has been criticized. In recent years, investors have shown skepticism that Bitcoin had little to no real-world use, institutional adoption, or regulatory clarity. In recent weeks, many of these concerns are diminishing, including:Real-world use: More international citizens in countries like Argentina and Turkey are using Bitcoin to stave off hyper-inflation than ever before. The proof? While Bitcoin remains well off its highs domestically, BTC recently hit new highs versus Argentina and Turkey's currencies – a sign that global, real-world adoption is real.Institutional Adoption: In just the last month, some of the largest asset managers in the world (BlackRock, Fidelity, and others) announced their plans to enter the industry.Regulatory Clarity: Though the SEC's lawsuit against Coinbase (COIN) is a short-term hurdle for the company, the outcome may be bullish for Bitcoin over the long term because it will provide the industry with some much-needed regulatory guardrails.Healthy Earnings EstimatesWall Street expects EPS to grow at a triple-digit clip over the next three quarters.Bullish Technical PatternOn Friday, a negative headline from the SEC about inadequate Bitcoin ETF filings hit crypto-related stocks. However, MSTR shook off the news and rebounded quickly – a sign of resilience. MSTR is about to break out of a nearly one-year long base structure. As the old saying goes, ""The longer the base, the higher in space."" ConclusionThe bullish Bitcoin catalysts and big EPS estimates set up a dynamic duo for MSTR into year-end. If MSTR can clear the $350 level on a closing basis over the next few days, the stock has explosive potential.Bear of the Day:Company OverviewMissouri-based Zacks Rank #5 stock (Strong Sell) Arch Resources Inc. is one of the leading coal producers in the world and operates nine mines across the major coal basins of the United States. While Arch's mining facilities are located in the United States, it exports coal worldwide. In 2016 the company filed for bankruptcy but emerged stronger and grew its earnings as coal prices roared back. However, in 2023 and 2024, earnings are expected to trend lower.Emissions Concerns to Suck the Energy Out of ARCHThough Arch Resources is a well-run coal company, its earnings will likely be negatively impacted by climate change concerns and the world's meteoric shift to clean fuel sources from traditional sources. Unfortunately for Arch, major macro-shifts in the energy economy are out of the company's control. Presently, natural gas and renewable energy are the choices over coal for energy needs. Furthermore, cheap shale gas, technological advancements in clean energy, and government incentives make matters worse for ARCH.Coal IndustryCurrently, the Coal Industry is ranked 245 out of 251 – putting it in the bottom 2% of all industries tracked by Zacks. Studies by Zacks indicate that lowly ranked industry groups like the coal industry tend to underperform dramatically. Beyond the industry concerns, the coal industry is intensely competitive, with several bids for each new coal contract. Over the past year, ARCH is lower by 21% while its peer group is flat – a sign of dramatic underperformance.Patchy Earnings Surprise HistoryArch has produced earnings well below Zacks Consensus Estimates in seven of the past thirteen quarters.Bear FlagWhile the broader U.S. equities market has soared in recent months, ARCH has down-trended. Shares are now carving out a bear flag pattern after a short relief rally. If shares find resistance at the declining 50-day moving average, it could spell more downside.ConclusionArch Resources faces a weak industry, high-competitive environment, and fundamental challenges. To make matters worse for ARCH, the stock shows relative weakness versus the broader equity market and is carving out a bear flag pattern. Avoid ARCH for now.Additional content:Air Freight &amp; Cargo Stocks with Solid Dividend YieldThe Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry continues to grapple with issues like supply-chain disruptions and higher fuel costs. These are likely to keep the bottom line of companies in this industrial cohort under pressure.Despite these challenges, the industry has gained 12.1% year to date compared with the S&amp;P 500 Index's 15.1% appreciation and 9.4% growth of the broader Zacks Transportation sector.We believe the buoyant e-commerce demand scenario is a huge positive for the industry participants. Even though economies have reopened, consumers' thirst for online shopping is rampant. High shipping rates should also drive revenues.Given this backdrop, let's focus on a couple of air freight and cargo stocks, FedEx Corporation and United Parcel Service, Inc., which have consistently hiked dividends, thus highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.Stocks with a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty and stock market volatility. At the same time, they offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have superior fundamentals. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield of more than 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%. Each of these stocks mentioned below carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.FedEx: Based in Memphis, TN, FedEx provides transportation, e-commerce, and business services in the United States and internationally. Currently, the company has a market capitalization of $62.02 billion.FDX paid a quarterly dividend of $1.26 ($5.04 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.03% yield at the current stock price. This company's payout ratio is 31% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate is 12.72%. (Check FedEx's dividend history here)FedEx has been consistently making efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, which are encouraging. During fiscal 2023, FedEx paid dividends worth $1.2 billion and repurchased shares worth $1.5 billion. In fiscal 2022, FedEx paid dividends worth $793 million (higher than the $686 million dividend payout in fiscal 2021). Such shareholder-friendly moves indicate the company's commitment to creating value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business. These initiatives not only instill investors' confidence but positively impact earnings per share.United Parcel: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, United Parcel provides transportation and delivery, distribution, contract logistics, ocean freight, airfreight, customs brokerage and insurance services. Currently, it has a market capitalization of $152.02 billion.UPS paid out a quarterly dividend of $1.62 ($6.48 annualized) per share, which gives it a 3.69% yield at the current stock price. This company's payout ratio is 54% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate is 12.60%. (Check United Parcel's dividend history here).UPS' strong free cash flow-generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. In first-quarter 2023, UPS generated a free cash flow of $2,357 million. In 2022, UPS generated free cash flow of $9,038 million. Robust free cash flow generation is a major positive, leading to an uptick in shareholder-friendly activities.Notably, UPS paid dividends worth $1,348 million and repurchased shares worth $751 million in first-quarter 2023. In 2022, UPS paid dividends worth $5,114 million and repurchased shares worth $3,500 million. In 2023, UPS expects to make dividend payments of $5.4 billion and repurchase shares worth $3 billion.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.12%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.03%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 5.14%.American Express will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be July 21, 2023. On that day, American Express is projected to report earnings of $2.61 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 1.56%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $15.31 billion, up 14.26% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $11.15 per share and revenue of $61 billion, which would represent changes of +13.2% and +15.39%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for American Express. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Eagle Materials Inc. EXP, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM, Vulcan Materials Co. VMC and Summit Materials, Inc. SUM.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Construction Boom to Boost Concrete StocksConcrete and aggregates are essentially building materials, and so, are closely linked to the construction market, whether residential or commercial. The current situation of rising rates and persistent inflation are negative for this industry as it is for others. However, market dynamics indicate strong growth prospects in the next few years, as well as in the long term. Therefore, it should figure in your portfolios at this time. Read on to know more: Increasing Homebuilding DemandIt is no secret that we currently have a housing shortage.Just this week, there was some disappointing data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), which said that its pending home sales index dropped 2.7% in May. Moreover, pending transactions were down 22.2% on the year. The NAR's pending home sales index (base year 2001) measures housing contract activity based on signed real estate contracts for existing single-family homes, condos and co-ops. It is therefore a leading indicator of housing market activity.The main reason for the softness is lack of available inventory, both new and existing. The high interest rates are keeping out existing inventory, although tax incentives may alleviate this situation.While interest rates are also increasing costs for builders, these companies are incentivized by strong demand. As may be expected in any high demand scenario, home prices are increasing again. According to the latest S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, home prices increased for the third straight month in April (the latest data). Prices were up across all of the 20 cities tracked.Story continuesGovernment Infrastructure Spending PlanThe Biden administration's $1.2 trillion infrastructure plan that includes funding for roads and bridges ($110 billion), public transit ($39 billion, including modernization and repairs as well as provisions for the elderly and those with disabilities) broadband internet ($65 billion, includes a $30 a month subsidy to 1 in 4 Americans for high speed access), the electric grid ($108 billion), EVs ($7.5 billion), clean drinking water ($55 billion to change all the piping), airports ($25 billion), etc. Therefore, there's a whole lot in there to do with construction activity, all of which will greatly increase demand for concrete and aggregates.Repair &amp; Remodel in Full SwingThe last 10 years have seen the sale of 5-6 million existing homes each year. An NAR report from last year talks about the average age of homes being 39 years. Obviously, as homes age, they require more repair. Additionally, changing lifestyles require different setups, for which more significant alterations may be required.Rising home prices and higher interest rates are also a deterrent to getting a new house. As a result, people may be more inclined to remodel what they already have. Another factor that plays a role is the kind of buyers. Millennials are more focused on value because their cost of living and student debt among other things leave them less cash to spare. To buy an existing home and remodel it according to their requirements could be an attractive proposition for them. According to JP Morgan's 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook, ""E-commerce will likely serve as a tailwind for the logistics industry—and industrial warehouse and distribution properties—for at least 10 years... The industry has begun to respond and deliver record amounts of new warehouses."" The retail space is also likely to see some changes since malls and other locations that thrived from officegoer traffic are struggling to meet their financial commitments. Some cities are repurposing their Grade B and C malls to include restaurants, movie theaters and experiential retail. Manufacturing infrastructure and data center growth are other drivers.Additionally, global economic growth with its focus on infrastructure modernization/sustainability, energy transition and national security, as well as growing urbanization across the world are secular drivers of this industry. These initiatives will require the construction of new buildings, transportation networks, and renewable energy projects, all of which rely on concrete and aggregates.Near-term DynamicsIn the near term, there could be persistent challenges related to the supply chain, which would be negative for material costs as well as transportation and logistics. The higher interest rates are also increasing the cost of borrowing. Additionally, in the current environment, many companies engaged in construction activity are having issues with the availability of raw materials and availability and skill of their labor force. This also slows down consumption of construction materials like concrete and aggregates.Given the positive outlook overall, there are many companies to choose from. I've picked four:Eagle Materials Inc.Dallas, TX-based Eagle Materials, manufactures and sells heavy construction materials and light building materials in the U.S. Its four operating segments are Cement, Concrete and Aggregates, Gypsum Wallboard, and Recycled Paperboard.Having topped March quarter estimates by 18.7%, Eagle Materials is seeing solid estimate revisions. The current year (ending March 2024) estimate has increased 7.9% in the last 60 days, representing 8.4% growth for the year. The estimate for the following year is up 7.8%, representing 9.4% growth.Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.Raleigh, NC-based Martin Marietta is a natural resource-based building materials company, supplying crushed stone, sand and gravel products, as well as ready mixed concrete and asphalt; paving products and services; and Portland and specialty cement.Martin Marietta beat estimates by 118.2% in the last quarter. In the last 60 days, there is an 8.4% increase in its 2023 estimate and a 7.5% increase in its 2024 estimate. At the current level, 2023 earnings are expected to grow 33.1% while 2024 earnings are expected to grow 13.9%.Vulcan Materials Co.Birmingham, AL-based Vulcan produces and supplies construction aggregates primarily in the U.S. It operates through four segments: Aggregates, Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium.The company's 2023 estimate has increased 11.1% while the 2024 estimate increased 9.7% in the last 60 Days. Analysts are projecting 27.6% earnings growth this year and 18.4% growth in the next. This may well be achievable given the 48.4% earnings beat in the last quarter.Summit Materials, Inc.Denver, CO-based Summit is a vertically integrated construction materials company offering aggregates, cement, ready-mix concrete, asphalt paving mixes, and concrete products, as well as plastics components through operating three segments: West, East and Cement.After the solid performance in the last quarter, wherein Summit Materials posted a positive surprise of 31.6%, analysts are incrementally optimistic about this stock. They've raised their 2023 estimate 5.0% and their 2024 estimate 6.6%. That means, they expect earnings to grow 16.5% in 2023 and 19.8% in 2024.EXP, MLM and VMC are ranked #1 (Strong Buy) by Zacks. SUM is rated #2 (Buy).Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

This is due to the company's securitization plan that allows for the removal of the remaining value of its A.B. Brown coal plant assets from customer rates.The securitization financing is in sync with CNP’s goal to deliver safe and reliable services, while prioritizing customer savings.CenterPoint is the first utility to use this type of financing in Indiana. The company will reinvest proceeds from the securitization bonds into its generation transition plan, including renewable resources such as wind and solar powered generation. Both of these will be supported by natural gas generation resources to maintain reliability.Rationale Behind the MoveAll residential customers, small businesses and industrial electric customer groups in Indiana will see savings. Residential consumers who use about 900 kilowatt hours per month are anticipated to receive a monthly bill credit of more than $5. The extra fee that was added to consumers' bills to pay for the securitization bonds will be more than offset by the credits from the securitization of A.B. Brown assets.A financing order for the coal retirement securitization bonds was granted by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission in January 2023. This is anticipated to result in a $53-million overall decline in consumers' electric bills.In 2021, a legislation was approved in Indiana that permits a securitization pilot program for CenterPoint’s power consumers in the state. The business awaited the chance to show how this service may help customers save money compared to traditional utility financing.A.B. Brown coal units 1 and 2 will be shut down by CenterPoint in October 2023, as part of its long-term electric power transition plan. By issuing the securitization bonds at a reduced long-term interest rate, the residual value of the coal plants and other qualified costs are financed.Story continuesPrice PerformanceIn the past month, shares of CenterPoint have risen 1.4% compared with the industry’s 1.1% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCenterPoint currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the same industry are PPL Corporation PPL, NiSource Inc.

The Spine and Dental business spin-off is part of the company’s portfolio transformation focused on getting more revenues in faster growth markets.Of late, Zimmer Biomet has been strengthening its foothold within emerging markets that provide long-term opportunities for growth. However, escalated expenses and a competitive landscape pose challenges for ZBH.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has increased 35.8% against the 21.6% fall of the industry and the 16.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The leading musculoskeletal healthcare company has a market capitalization of $30.37 billion. The company has an earnings yield of 5.12% against the industry’s -2.25%. Zimmer Biomet surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average earnings surprise of 7.38%.Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsBusiness Recovery Continues: In the last reported quarter, ZBH’s domestic sales were well ahead of the company’s expectations, with elective procedure volumes recovering and procedure cancellation rates returning to pre-pandemic levels. Internationally, sales across the EMEA region were driven by faster recovery and strength across developed and emerging markets.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn terms of product category, global knees witnessed a strong uptake across the full Persona product portfolio and sales traction in all regions. Global hips’ performance demonstrated continued traction across the Avenir and G7 product lines, along with the ongoing uptake of Rosa hip. The S.E.T. (sports extremities and trauma)category was impacted by the continued strong performance across its key focus areas of CMFT, sports medicines and upper extremities.Dental and Spine Spin-off to Bode Well: Zimmer Biomet recently completed its planned spin-off procedure of the dental &amp; spine arm as part of the company’s third phase of the ongoing transformation.Story continuesThe transaction represents an important step in ZBH’s transition to a more streamlined company with a greater focus on optimized resource allocation, including innovations in profitable core businesses and attractive markets with opportunities to become market leaders.A Focus on Emerging Markets: The company’s strategic investments in emerging markets over the past several quarters to improve operational and sales performance are yielding results. Following the integration of Biomet, the S.E.T business is expected to move forward, due to a strong presence in these regions with an extended portfolio that includes upper and lower joints.Within emerging markets, we note that the strength of the Asia Pacific market has continued to drive strong revenue growth so far. ZBH is expected to continue with this trend post the COVID-19 mayhem, banking on a cadence of product launches and strong customer adoptions.DownsidesQ1 Negatives: The company continued to face significant challenges in terms of unfavorable foreign exchange, supply, inflation and staffing shortage. Reimbursement headwinds in the U.S. restorative therapies are another downside. In APAC, the company saw some pressure on China as anticipated. Meanwhile, mounting expenses are putting pressure on margins.A Competitive Landscape: The medical device market is intensely competitive. The orthopedic industry, in particular, is comprised of players like Stryker, Johnson &amp; Johnson's DePuy, Smith &amp; Nephew and Medtronic. ZBH needs to constantly introduce or acquire new products to withstand competitive pressure and maintain its market share.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Zimmer Biomet’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at $7.45 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $7.33 billion.

This is anticipated to result in a $53-million overall decline in consumers' electric bills.In 2021, a legislation was approved in Indiana that permits a securitization pilot program for CenterPoint’s power consumers in the state. The business awaited the chance to show how this service may help customers save money compared to traditional utility financing.A.B. Brown coal units 1 and 2 will be shut down by CenterPoint in October 2023, as part of its long-term electric power transition plan. By issuing the securitization bonds at a reduced long-term interest rate, the residual value of the coal plants and other qualified costs are financed.Story continuesPrice PerformanceIn the past month, shares of CenterPoint have risen 1.4% compared with the industry’s 1.1% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCenterPoint currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the same industry are PPL Corporation PPL, NiSource Inc.

213,83dcde9a-14a6-30c9-951e-f583efe5288d,MDLZ,2023-07-04,7 Stocks to Buy for Stubbornly High Inflation,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-stubbornly-high-094553918.html,1687945553,STORY,"['TGT', 'NTR', 'PEP', 'WMT', 'XOM', 'ALB', 'MDLZ', 'GOLD']","[Stubbornly high inflation creates opportunities within the stock market. That is precisely the environment we are currently within, with May inflation reaching 4.1%, well beyond the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The Fed has chosen to pause rate hikes, likely out of fear of further banking turmoil, meaning inflation isn’t likely to be curbed anytime soon.Traditionally, there are four classes of investments that tend to perform best dring periods of sustained inflation; commodities, consumer staples, inflation-indexed bonds, and real estate. We don’t cover bonds here, so they’re out. Real estate is too risky, it too is out. That leaves commodities and consumer staples stocks as the categories to consider. Here are three of the best stocks in these categories I think are worth buying right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNutrien (NTR)A tractor spreading fertilizer over a farm field.Source: Fotokostic / Shutterstock.comNutrien (NYSE:NTR) is a Saskatchewan-based company that provides potash, nitrogen, and phosphate to its customers. Those products are necessary for the agriculture and livestock industries. In other words, the company plays an integral role in our food supply chain.Thus, as food prices rise, so too does demand for supplier inputs like potash, nitrogen, and phosphate. These minerals are basically the most essential to human survival. That may be a bit of an overstatement, but Nutrien’s business model is one that’s pretty straightforward to understand.Nutrien has dealt with a lot of volatility over the past year, as the war in Ukraine has provided opportunities, but also unforeseeable issues. The company saw crop nutrient sales boom, as Ukraine exports were choked by the war. However, prices then decreased as factories stabilized in response to the outbreak of war.Here’s the point as it relates to NTR stock. The company is stabilizing, despite slightly lower EBITDA projections for 2023. That isn’t particularly positive news. But NTR stock has nearly $20 of upside beyond its current price, if the analysts are correct. Additionally, this company has established itself as a global commodities behemoth, something that can protect investor portfolios against inflation. Thus, for those thinking we may have more hefty prints ahead of us, this is a name to own.Story continuesAlbemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) stock provides a rollercoaster ride for risk-seeking commodities investors. The last few years have proven as much, with investors seeing the valuation of this lithium producer more than triple. At its peak-to-trough high, ALB stock managed to quadruple in less than two years.That rise is the product of the boom in EV sales. Lithium is heavily used in EV batteries, and thus its price is tied to demand for EV batteries. Lithium went from $10,000 per metric ton just before the pandemic to $90,000 per metric ton by November 2022. This price then fell to $24,000, but has since moved slightly higher and appears to be stabilizing.Insider buying by CEO Kent Masters in early May provided reason to believe that shares of ALB stock should rise. Indeed they have, moving from $181 to $227 per share since he initiated his position May 5. There’s reason to believe ALB shares should logically move higher.For one, EVs have reached a mass adoption tipping point, and there’s no turning back now. Two, pure metrics-based sites including Gurufocus believe ALB shares could more than double from current prices based on quantitative factors alone.Exxon Mobil (XOM)XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some TimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock continues to move higher, though it has cooled somewhat over the past few months. That stagnation is likely an opportunity for investors to buy, particularly those concerned about inflation remaining stubbornly high. Exxon Mobil’s commodity of choice, for investors who don’t know, is oil.Exxon Mobil produced a record $55.7 billion in earnings in 2022 and $77 billion in cash flows. High oil prices were clearly very kind to the company. However, as we’ve seen in recent years, energy has been among the most volatile commodities out there. Thus, it’s been notoriously difficult to predict which direction oil will move, based on a myriad of supply and demand factors.This year has shown as much, with investors backing away from XOM stock, due to a range of generally bearish macro conditions.But Exxon Mobil is hedging its bets. It is leaning into lithium production, and secured drilling rights to sites in Arkansas in May. Exxon’s European counterparts have long been shifting toward a greener future and investing more heavily into such technology and energy sources. Lithium is clearly a huge growth sector due to its importance in EV battery production, and the future iterations of batteries to come.Thus, XOM stock may appear more diversified in the minds of many investors, and still offers upside to the price of oil, for those worried about inflationary forces.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comPepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) has become a household consumer staples stock which investors should consider right now. Inflation remains high, growing 4% in May, but consumers have become habituated to paying high prices.That’s a boon for Pepsi, which sells a startlingly high number of the snack brands that populate that aisles of supermarkets. Those brands include Lay’s, Doritos, Miss Vickie’s, Fritos, Cracker Jack, Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and more.Pepsi has been the beneficiary of very strong demand in 2023. Notably, despite higher prices in the first quarter, revenues grew by more than 10%. The first quarter is now behind us, and the markets are always concerned with current news. Accordingly, I’m not sure what Pepsi’s Q2 revenues will look like, but speaking anecdotally, I’m guessing they’ll remain strong. I say that because snack prices remain elevated.If Pepsi retains its pricing power, this stock has real inflation-fighting credibility worth considering.Walmart (WMT)Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is known for low prices, and has been able to charge these every day low prices due to the massive pricing power it exerts due to its scale. Those low prices act as a beacon to bargain shoppers. That truth should only become more evident in the coming weeks and months.Walmart already saw sales increase by 7.6% during the first quarter, with operating income improving by 17.3%. Consumers are increasingly spending their weakening incomes at Walmart. Additionally, the company  is also drawing higher-income shoppers, who may have avoided this big-box retailer in the past. That fact suggests that demand is increasing across the board, something that should continue to benefit Walmart overall.Beyond those encouraging statistics, Walmart is also continuing to improve its position against its chief rival, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Walmart’s e-commerce division grew 26% on a global basis in the first quarter. Walmart isn’t satisfied with being the world’s largest retailer, and clearly wants to dominate digital retail as well. Thus, in this inflationary environment, this is a stock that has some real ability to continue growing.Barrick Gold (GOLD)How to Play Barrick Gold Stock Ahead of Today's EarningsSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comThe thinking with investing in Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) stock as inflation rises is simple. People have lost trust in the U.S. dollar and other national currencies. Gold has been a store of value for thousands of years, far longer than any national currency. It has proven to be a reliable store of value during for millennia, so investors return to the yellow metal when fiat currency weakens in value due to inflation.Investors also turn to firms that mine the precious metal. And Barrick is among the biggest in the space.How GOLD stock moves from here will remain difficult to predict. That said, shares of this top gold miner peaked above $29 per share during the pandemic as similar concerns plagued the economy. It now trades around the $16 level, and is near its recent lows.Gold stocks don’t move based on easy-to-predict factors. But Barrick Gold operates the largest portfolio of Tier One gold assets in the world. Tier One assets are those that have the highest lifespan classification and gold production expectations.Mondelez International (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockMondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a lot like Pepsi. Both snack companies are riding high, as demand has not cooled even as producers push higher prices onto customers.Its revenue growth was even greater than Pepsi’s during the first quarter, coming in at 18.1%.  Organic revenues (those from existing operations) grew at an even higher rate of 19.4% on a year-over-year basis.The company’s second quarter is projected to be strong, again based on anecdotal evidence, admittedly. Trsicuits, Wheat Thins, and Ritz crackers all remain expensive, pointing to sustained demand amid higher prices.Mondelez International has been successful in its rebrand from its former Kraft name. In fact, it has been so successful in that effort that it has inspired other firms, namely Kellogg’s (NYSE:K) in spinning out their snacking business. Kellogg’s will reportedly rebrand its snacking business as Kellanova by the end of 2023. That success suggests Mondelez international will remain a strong investment, especially as consumer staples stocks muddle on during inflationary times.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 10.8% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 12.2%. McKesson’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 4.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcKesson is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its robust Biologics business. The optimism led by a solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and its strength in the distribution market are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trends persist.Let’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversStrength in Biologics: Investors are optimistic about McKesson’s robust Biologics business. Independent specialty pharmacy, Biologics by McKesson, has been making impressive progress lately. In April, the pharmacy was selected by Reata Pharmaceuticals as the sole specialty pharmacy provider for SKYCLARYS (omaveloxolone), the first and only treatment for Friedreich’s ataxia.In February, the pharmacy was selected by Lilly as a specialty pharmacy provider for JAYPIRCA (pirtobrutinib) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma after at least two lines of systemic therapy, including a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor.Strength in Distribution Market: McKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market, which raises investors’ optimism. The Distribution Solutions segment caters to a wide range of customers and businesses and stands to benefit from increased generic utilization, inflation in generics driven by several patent expirations in the next few years and an aging population.Story continuesPer the fiscal fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call in May, the company’s U.S. and international distribution businesses continued to play a key role in the pandemic response. Strong Q4 Results: McKesson’s robust fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy optimism. The company recorded robust top-line and bottom-line performances and strength in its U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments.DownsidesWeak Trends: McKesson distributes generic pharmaceuticals, which are subject to price fluctuation. The Distribution Solutions segment continues to experience weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trends. Continued volatility, unfavorable pricing trends, reimbursement of generic drugs and significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches could have a material adverse impact on McKesson.Stiff Competition: Distribution Solutions faces stiff competition both in terms of price and service from various full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large-payer organizations. Moreover, the company depends on fewer suppliers for its products. As a result, it is not in a position to negotiate pricing.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, HealthEquity, Inc. HQY and Boston Scientific Corporation BSX.Hologic, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 5.1% for fiscal 2024.

The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 11.9% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 15.4%. Integer Holdings’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 1.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInteger Holdings is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its improving non-medical sales. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and its solid foothold in the broader MedTech space are expected to contribute further. However, dependence on third-party suppliers and stiff competition continues to concern the company.Let’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversImproving Non-Medical Sales: We are upbeat about Integer Holdings’ improvement in its Non-Medical sales. In the first quarter of 2023, revenues at the Non-Medical Sales segment rose 63.4% year over year. The upside was driven by strong sales at the Electrochem product line, part of the Non-Medical segment, across all market segments and continued supplier delivery recovery.Solid Foothold in the Broader MedTech Space: We are optimistic about Integer Holdings’ stable footing in the cardiac, neuromodulation, orthopedics, vascular and advanced surgical markets. Its primary customers include large, multi-national original equipment manufacturers and their affiliated subsidiaries.Integer Holdings has been focusing on its sales efforts to increase its market penetration in the Cardio &amp; Vascular, Neuromodulation and Non-Medical Electrochem markets. The company is also making strategic initiatives to maintain its leadership position in the cardiac rhythm management market.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: Integer Holdings’ robust first-quarter 2023 results raise our optimism. The company registered strong year-over-year top-line and bottom-line performances. Robust performances by both segments and strength in all three product lines of the Medical Sales segment were also recorded. The expansion of the adjusted operating margin bodes well for the stock.DownsidesStiff Competition: Competition with respect to the manufacturing of Integer Holdings’ medical products across all its product lines has intensified in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. The market for commercial power sources is competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid technological change. Many other commercial power source suppliers are larger than Integer Holdings and have greater resources, which may help them develop superior (technologically or otherwise) or more cost-effective products than the latter, thus resulting in lower revenues and operating results for Integer Holdings.Dependence on Third-Party Suppliers: Integer Holdings’ business depends on a continuous supply of raw materials, which may be susceptible to fluctuations due to transportation issues, government regulations and price controls, among others. Significant increases in the cost of raw materials, which cannot be recovered through increases in the prices of the company’s products, could adversely affect its operating results.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, HealthEquity, Inc. HQY and Boston Scientific Corporation BSX.Hologic, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 5.1% for fiscal 2024.

ACHC recently inked a joint venture (“JV”) with the New Hampshire-based integrated health system, SolutionHealth, for constructing a behavioral health hospital in the state.Equipped to house 144 beds, the facility will extend a comprehensive suite of inpatient behavioral healthcare services, which remain much-needed across southeast New Hampshire. Apart from enhancing access to behavioral health services across the region and bringing about improved health outcomes, the other areas of focus of the JV are discussed henceforth.The partners aim to lower the waiting time for patients at the emergency department for behavioral health triage and disposition. Additionally, they tend to provide an enhanced behavioral health center that can be availed by the targeted region’s patients within close proximity of their homes. New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services will pay $15 million to support the construction costs of the new hospital.Thereby, the recent tie-up of Acadia Healthcare can be termed as a time-opportune move owing to the growing incidence of mental health issues among Americans and a significant portion of New Hampshire’s population grappling with such problems. ACHC seems well-poised to capitalize on the unaddressed demand for high-quality behavioral health services throughout the state.The partnership has made way for Acadia Healthcare to delve into a new state with its acute service line. It also marks the 19th JV partnership of ACHC. In each of these JVs, ACHC has collaborated with well-established healthcare organizations based across different U.S. communities and subsequently integrated the resources, expertise and practices of both partners. This has enabled it to devise a solid behavioral health services portfolio, diversified the treatment network and expanded the nationwide foothold of Acadia Healthcare.Management remains optimistic about pursuing similar partnerships with leading U.S. health systems in the future to address mental health issues and substance use disorders prevailing throughout the country, which seems commendable.Story continuesAcadia Healthcare has numerous JV projects scheduled in its pipeline, which make it optimistic about the year 2023. The one with Michigan-based Bronson Healthcare to construct a freestanding behavioral health facility in the state, which was supposed to commence operations from the third quarter of 2023, has been already inaugurated this June. The planned facility in Pennsylvania as a result of the JV with Geisinger Health is also likely to open this year. As a part of its growth-related initiatives, in addition to JVs, management also aims to add roughly 300 beds to its existing facilities in 2023.Shares of Acadia Healthcare have risen 11.3% in a year, compared with the industry’s 60.2% growth.

221,d1473bc5-b865-3e4f-b738-48ac1bf6546f,BSX,2023-07-04,Here's Why You Should Invest in Neogen (NEOG) Stock Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-invest-neogen-neog-133500327.html,1688391300,STORY,"['NEOG', 'HOLX', 'BSX', 'HQY']","[Neogen Corporation NEOG is well poised to gain in the coming quarters, led by strong performance across its Animal Safety and Food Safety segments. It focuses on product launches to strengthen its business on a global scale. However, escalating costs and stiff competition are a concern.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has lost 10.5% compared with a 20.5% fall of the industry and a 18.4% increase of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned food and animal safety products provider has a market capitalization of $4.70 billion. The company’s fiscal third-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a remarkable 200%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayAnimal Safety Business Grows Well: Animal Safety revenues in the fiscal third quarter were up 1.9% year over year, consisting of 2.2% core growth. The core growth was led by the company’s portfolio of biosecurity products, driven largely by insect control share gains in the animal protein market.The company’s genomics business also performed well, with global core growth of 7.7%, led by volume increases in the global beef markets, partially offset by declines in testing in China caused by the continuation of COVID-related lab closures.Per management, the acquisitions of GVS and CAPInnoVet are part of Neogen’s strategy to expand companion animal offerings. The company’s acquisition of Delf UK Limited is expected to bolster its performance dairy chemicals offerings. Delf’s industrial cleaning products complement Neogen’s Quat-Chem disinfectant and cleaner offerings, enhancing its biosecurity portfolio.Food Safety Sales Growth Continues: Neogen continues to see rising revenues from the Food Safety business. For third-quarter fiscal 2023, Food Safety revenues surged 141.5% year over year, consisting of 5.8% core growth and 139.1% from acquisitions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe core growth was led by the Culture Media &amp; Other category, which benefited from a large order from a vaccine manufacturer. In the Bacterial &amp; General Sanitation product category, a solid increase in sales of Soleris spoilage detection products contributed to the growth.Story continuesProduct Launches: Neogen, of late, has been focusing on product launches to strengthen its business on a global scale.In March 2023, Neogen announced that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved additional virucide claims to its Neogen Viroxide Super disinfectant. These label claims specify that Neogen Viroxide Super kills viruses on hard non-porous surfaces that cause Avian Influenza A, Bovine Viral Diarrhea, Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome (PRRS), and African Swine Fever.In November 2022, Neogen introduced an upgraded version of its best-selling Ideal D3 detectable needles, designed to be six times more detectable than the conventional and stainless-steel needles.DownsidesMounting Operating Expenses:  In the fiscal third quarter, Negen’s sales and marketing expenses rose 79.7%, whereas administrative expenses rose 85.7% from the prior-year quarter’s levels. Research &amp; development expenses were up 59.1% year over year. Operating costs increased 80.8% from the last year’s quarter.Competitive Landscape Tough: Neogen faces intense competition from small businesses to divisions of large multinational companies. Some of these organizations have greater financial resources. NEOG faced intense competition from the development of new technologies by the company’s competitor, which could affect the marketability and profitability of Neogen’s products.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Neogen’s earnings for 2023 has moved 11.1% north to 50 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $807.9 million, suggesting a 53.3% rise from the 2022 reported number.Other Key PicksA few top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

222,ddab1bd3-5546-3082-815d-4a1fe00e3852,BSX,2023-07-04,Some Investors May Be Worried About Boston Scientific's (NYSE:BSX) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-may-worried-boston-scientifics-130027571.html,1688389227,STORY,['BSX'],"[If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. In light of that, when we looked at Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Boston Scientific is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.074 = US$2.1b ÷ (US$33b - US$4.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Boston Scientific has an ROCE of 7.4%.  On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 8.9% average generated by the Medical Equipment industry. View our latest analysis for Boston Scientific roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Boston Scientific compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Boston Scientific.The Trend Of ROCEWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at Boston Scientific, we didn't gain much confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 12%, but since then they've fallen to 7.4%. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesOn a related note, Boston Scientific has decreased its current liabilities to 12% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.What We Can Learn From Boston Scientific's ROCEIn summary, Boston Scientific is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 60% over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.Boston Scientific does have some risks, we noticed   3 warning signs  (and 1 which is concerning)  we think you should know about.While Boston Scientific isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

223,f19eafa9-cdfc-38f2-860c-6598f1810558,COF,2023-07-04,Capital One Financial's (NYSE:COF) three-year earnings growth trails the 23% YoY shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/capital-one-financials-nyse-cof-120047311.html,1688472047,STORY,['COF'],"[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. Just take a look at Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF), which is up 77%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 33% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 6.4% , including dividends .After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Capital One Financial To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Capital One Financial achieved compound earnings per share growth of 41% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 21% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 7.55 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Capital One Financial has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling Capital One Financial stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Capital One Financial's TSR for the last 3 years was 87%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveCapital One Financial shareholders are up 6.4% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 5% over half a decade This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  Capital One Financial is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is potentially serious...Of course Capital One Financial may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of growth stocks.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

That's across the board from fast food plays such as McDonald's to sit-down eateries in the mold of Olive Garden owner Darden.Everything but the kitchen sink has been tossed at restaurant companies and their stocks this year.Slowing GDP growth has taken hold, which usually doesn't translate to strong financial results from restaurants. Rising menu prices have consumers thinking twice about a family dinner out on the town.Higher average hourly earnings for waiters, waitresses, and back-of-house staff are weighing on profits. Inflation has hit everybody.And of course, much higher interest rates make putting 10 orders of pizza from Papa John's after a kid's sports game on a credit card adds another expensive wrinkle.Even the infatuation with AI stocks serving to suck investment dollars from other sectors in the market could be viewed as a headwind.Yet here we stand, with most restaurant stocks doing quite well for the year. Restaurant sales as sourced by the Census Bureau have trended higher in recent months. As you can see in our nifty infographic, same-store sales for most major chain restaurants strengthened in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 2022.Story continuesMcDonald's, for example, saw higher sales in the first quarter on the back of higher menu prices and guest counts.Winning recipe.Veteran restaurant analyst Danilo Gargiulo at Bernstein tells me there are at least three reasons behind the moves in the stocks and the financial resilience:""Restaurants are an affordable luxury: even if consumers’ wallets are more squeezed, the typical spending reduction occurs among durable goods and large ticket items first; reduction in spending at restaurants is the last resort.Unemployment rate is still low. The biggest negative impact on restaurant demand comes from reducing disposable income and increasing unemployment rate. Consumer sentiment and future outlook matter, but only marginally. Today we are still enjoying healthy employment rates in the United States, favoring restaurants’ demand.Restaurant prices have grown less than grocery prices. The relative inflation of food at home (i.e. grocery) vs food away from home (restaurants) has once more favored restaurants’ demand, given that the pricing actions taken by restaurants have been significantly more moderate vs the price increases at the average grocery.""Another ingredient (and one Fed chief Jay Powell could eat up) at play is inflation that is finally cooling.""There’s a line of sight to lower inflation/less margin pressure,"" Bank of America restaurant analyst Sara Senatore tells me of the appetite to own restaurant stocks in 2023So can these stocks continue to cook up the surprising gains?Maybe, but the second half headwinds will be almost as formidable as the first half, pros say. Chief among them is potentially a next leg down in economic growth and two more interest rate hikes from the Fed.""The group is heading into any potential slowdown in much better shape than perhaps any prior US recessions,"" one long-time restaurant analyst remarked to me.Somewhat reassuring.The pros think it's best to remain with best-in-breed names rather than bet on turnaround stories.""We believe that Yum! Brands and Wendy’s will continue to have positive momentum in the second half of the year, but we expect Chipotle and Darden to provide the greatest returns, as they directly operate their stores and can capture the upside from more moderate commodity inflation,"" Bernstein's Gargiulo says.Chew on that.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

226,84902527-ff1b-3e95-8c69-4d9fcc8d320c,KO,2023-07-04,Here's Why AB InBev (BUD) Can Make it Big Despite Cost Headwinds,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-ab-inbev-bud-160000899.html,1688400000,STORY,"['ABI', 'BUD', 'KO', 'NAPA']","[Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV BUD, alias AB InBev, has been benefiting from its unique commercial strategy, strong brand portfolio and investments in operational excellence. Continued business momentum due to relentless execution, investment in its brands and accelerated digital transformation have been key drivers.Additionally, the company looks well-poised to gain from the expansion of the Beyond Beer portfolio and investments in B2B platforms, e-commerce and digital marketing in the near term. The premiumization of the beer industry has been a key growth opportunity for AB InBev. These have been aiding the company’s top lines over the past few quarters.However, BUD has been witnessing higher costs and soft margin trends owing to commodity headwinds and higher supply-chain costs in some markets. This has been weighing on the company’s bottom-line results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AB InBev’s 2023 sales suggests growth of 6.6% from the year-ago period’s reported numbers, whereas earnings per share (EPS) estimate indicates a decline of 1.6% year over year.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 3% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 1.2%. The Consumer Staple sector has declined 0.1%. However, the stock’s performance compared unfavorably against the S&amp;P 500’s growth of 16.4% in the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Makes BUD Strong?AB InBev is steadfastly growing its Beyond Beer portfolio, including products like Ready-to-Drink beverages like canned wine and canned cocktails, hard seltzers, cider and flavored malt beverages. The Beyond Beer trend has been recently gaining popularity due to the rise in demand for low-alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks. The company remains focused on expanding its Beyond Beer portfolio, which has also been aiding the top line.The Beyond Beer portfolio contributed more than $325 million to the total revenues in first-quarter 2023. The global Beyond Beer business’ revenues improved by low-single digits in the first quarter. The company witnessed 75% revenue growth in Brazil as Beats activated demand during the return of Carnival. In the U.S. spirits-based ready-to-drink segment, the company’s Cutwater and NUTRL vodka seltzer together delivered revenue growth of more than 50%.AB InBev has been rapidly growing its digital platform, leveraging technology, such as B2B sales and other e-commerce platforms, including BEES and Zé Delivery. The company is witnessing an acceleration in the B2B platforms, e-commerce and digital marketing trends, which has been aiding growth in the past few months.The company’s digital transformation initiatives have been on track, with B2B digital platforms contributing about 62% of its revenues in the first quarter. Its direct-to-consumer ecosystem, including Ze Delivery, TaDa and PerfectDraft, generated more than $100 million in revenues in first-quarter 2023, reflecting low-teens growth year over year.Premiumization of the beer industry also places BUD for growth in the long term. It has been investing in developing a diverse portfolio of global, international and crafts and specialty premium brands in its markets. Apart from the premium brands, the company’s global brands lead the way in premiumization. BUD’s above core portfolio grew revenues by mid-teens in first-quarter 2023, driven by continued double-digit growth of Michelob ULTRA in the United States and Mexico and double-digit growth of Original and Spaten in Brazil.Backed by the continued business momentum, AB InBev outlined its view for 2023. For 2023, the company expects EBITDA growth of 4-8%, which aligns with its medium-term outlook. It anticipates revenue growth to be higher than EBITDA growth, driven by strong volume and pricing.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeAB InBev continues to fall prey to commodity cost inflation and higher supply-chain costs in some markets. Higher commodity costs mainly resulted from increased aluminum and barley prices. BUD continued to witness higher costs and soft margin trends in the first quarter.The cost of sales increased 8.8% on a reported basis and 14% on an organic basis in the first quarter. SG&amp;A expenses rose 5.5% year over year and 10.3% on an organic basis. Higher SG&amp;A expenses can be attributed to elevated supply-chain costs.Consequently, the company’s gross margin contracted 70 basis points (bps) to 54.1%, on a reported basis in the first quarter. On an organic basis, the gross margin declined 35 bps. Normalized EBIT margin contracted 30 bps year over year to 24.6% in the first quarter. On an organic basis, the normalized EBIT margin declined 39 bps.Stocks to ConsiderWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely The Duckhorn Portfolio NAPA, Monster Beverage MNST and Coca-Cola KO.Duckhorn has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 14.2%, on average.

229,e50d3d76-4359-32de-9dce-0604c24e775f,INTU,2023-07-04,‘The Rule of 10’: Goldman Sachs Recommends Owning S&P Stocks With Sustained 10%-Plus Sales Growth — These 2 Names Fit the Bill,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rule-10-goldman-sachs-recommends-222211088.html,1688422931,STORY,"['GS', 'INTU', 'SEDG']","[Every investor wants a portfolio that will generate returns, but finding the right stocks for that is always a challenge. The analysts at Goldman Sachs have developed a data-based rule to sort through the mass of stocks and find the shares that are going to bring in solid returns.The key to Goldman’s ‘Rule of 10’ lies in each company’s projected sales growth – the firm looks for stocks with potential to show a multi-year CAGR of 10% or higher. According to David Kostin, the bank’s Chief Investment Officer and Head of Investment Strategy, rapid and consistent sales growth is a prevalent characteristic among today’s leading stocks as they ascend the ranks.“We refresh our ‘Rule of 10’ screen, which identifies stocks with realized and expected annual sales growth greater than 10% during the five years from 2021 through 2025,” Kostin noted.Some of the top analysts at Goldman Sachs have been recommending stocks that align with the ‘Rule of 10’ criteria. We’ll take a look at two of them, using the data drawn from the TipRanks platform. Both are S&amp;P-listed firms, and both have shown high sustained sales growth over time – with high potential to maintain that performance. It also doesn’t hurt that each stock is admired by the rest of the analyst community, enough so to earn a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Let’s take a closer look.SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG)The first Goldman pick on our list is SolarEdge Technologies, a designer and manufacturer of microinverters, which are essential technology in solar power installations. Microinverters convert DC current, the type produced by photovoltaic panels, into AC current that can be used on the grid and in household systems. SolarEdge is one of the leading companies in the US microinverter segment, with approximately 40% market share.The company doesn’t rest solely on the microinverter business; it produces a wide range of solar technology products. The product line includes monitoring systems for photovoltaic generation systems, power optimizers, and even solar-powered EV chargers for home use. SolarEdge markets directly to the residential market, as well as to commercial clients, including building owners, small businesses, construction clients, and installation professionals.Story continuesWhen examined through the lens of Goldman’s ‘Rule of 10,’ SolarEdge exhibits a projected sales CAGR of 24% from 2022 through the end of 2025. Few companies can match this remarkable level of sustained growth.SolarEdge’s current performance gives good reason to believe it will match the projections. The company showed several record metrics in its 1Q23 financial results, the last quarterly results reported. These included record quarterly revenue of $943.89 million, a result that was up 44% year-over-year and came in more than $12.05 million ahead of the estimates. The records also included the non-GAAP EPS result of $2.90, a significant improvement compared to the $1.20 value in 1Q22 and surpassing the forecast by 95 cents.In his coverage of SolarEdge for Goldman Sachs, 5-star analyst Brian Lee sees the company’s diversification as a key support for its success. Lee acknowledges that SolarEdge has established itself in the US residential solar market, but he also points out that the company’s business is expanding at the fastest pace in Europe and in the commercial and industrial markets.“For 2023, we expect Europe to be one of the fastest growing regions, with total solar installations up &gt;25% yoy (we expect the growth of resi to be inline-to-above the overall market) vs. US residential end market up &lt;10% yoy and recent datapoints suggesting it could end up being worse than that. Notably, SEDG’s shipments to Europe accounted for ~60% of the total in 1Q23… In terms of end market, 50%-60% of SEDG’s total volumes were shipped to the C&amp;I end market — which appears to have remained solid and resilient despite macro uncertainties vs. resi, based on our channel checks. With the aforementioned dynamics, we are tactically more positive on SEDG,” Lee opined.To this end, Lee rates SEDG shares a Buy, unsurprisingly in light of his comments, and sets a $445 price target that suggests ~65% one-year upside for the stock. (To watch Lee’s track record, click here)Overall, SolarEdge has attracted 13 analyst reviews recently, with a breakdown of 12 to 1 in favor of Buys over Holds. The shares are trading for $270.42, and the average price target of $389.54 suggests a gain of 44% in the next 12 months. (See SEDG stock forecast)Intuit, Inc. (INTU)The second stock we’re looking at has recently completed its strongest season of the year. Intuit is a software company best known for its two flagship products: TurboTax and QuickBooks. These software products provide tax calculation and filing services, bookkeeping capabilities, and other accounting tasks optimized for in-home or small business use. The company’s other products include the Credit Karma personal software package and the popular marketing automation system, Mailchimp.Intuit’s product line is aimed at facilitating financial and marketing record-keeping and automation for non-professionals, and the company boasts over 100 million customers worldwide. The company operates out of 20 offices in 9 different countries, and last year brought in $12.7 billion in total revenue.Applying the Goldman Rule of 10, we find that Intuit’s 2022 to 2025E CAGR runs at 13%, a solid figure that puts the company well above the 10% threshold Goldman uses to predict future success. The company has plenty of room for future growth, as its largest segment is tax prep – and the US tax preparation market alone exceeds $11.2 billion. Globally, the tax prep market is estimated at more than $28 billion this year.The company finished its fiscal Q3 on April 30, reporting top line revenue of $6.02 billion, up 7% from the prior year period. The revenues just missed expectations, coming in $73.9 million, or 1.22%, below the forecast. At the bottom line, Intuit’s non-GAAP earnings per share hit $8.92, for a 17% y/y increase, and beat the analyst forecasts by 42 cents.Kash Rangan, another of Goldman’s 5-star analysts, lays out several reasons why Intuit is poised to cash in on its growth potential. As the analyst writes, “We see several long-term structural growth drivers: 1) Generative AI could solidify INTU’s market leadership as it is uniquely positioned to leverage a vast amount of tax-related data with the use of LLMs. 2) The broader ~$30bn tax-prep market creates significant opportunities for TurboTax Live (which holds 3-5% of the market) to capture share. 3) With Intuit only capturing ~10% of the ~$2 trillion in volume occurring on its platform, and considering 70% of B2B payments are still not digitized, we expect its payments offering to scale to $4-5bn in revenue. Intuit’s ability to pull cost levers to drive efficiency despite lower top-line visibility should also be rewarded.”Quantifying his positive stance, Rangan gives Intuit shares a Buy rating, along with a $565 price target that indicates his confidence in a one-year upside of 25%. (To watch Rangan’s track record, click here)This is another stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street. The rating is based on 16 recent analyst reviews, which include 15 Buys against a single Hold. Intuit shares are currently priced at $451.57, while the $508.67 average price target implies ~13% upside going forward into next year.

230,b41ae4ea-4937-384d-947c-be170fe25659,SYK,2023-07-04,Stryker (SYK) Stock Hits 52-Week High: More Room to Grow?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stryker-syk-stock-hits-52-130400376.html,1688389440,STORY,['SYK'],"[Stryker Corporation SYK is well poised for growth, backed by a robust robotic arm-assisted surgery platform, Mako, and a diversified product portfolio. However, pricing pressure remains a concern.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 24.8% year to date compared with the industry’s 5.5% growth. The S&amp;P 500 Index has increased 16.9% in the same time frame.Stryker, with a market capitalization of $115.58 billion, is one of the world’s largest medical device companies operating in the orthopedic market. It anticipates earnings to improve 9.4% in the next five years. SYK’s earnings yield of 3.3% compares favorably with the industry’s (2.3%).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s earnings surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed twice, delivering an average surprise of 1.60%.Robust performance in the last two quarters enabled SYK’s shares to gain nearly 50% in the past year. A potential rise in demand for surgeries and a broad spectrum of products are likely to drive its share price higher.The company reached a new 52-week high in the past few trading sessions. This, along with a favorable Zacks Rank, makes it worth retaining in one's portfolio.Let’s delve deeper.What’s Favoring Stryker’s Growth?The company continues to witness strong demand for Mako and a healthy order book amid recovery in procedure-demand following the COVID-19 pandemic. This is due to the platform’s unique and promising features. These developments, in turn, enable Stryker to sustain the momentum in robotic-treatment sales.SYK is committed to the continued expansion of Mako, whose installations touched record high during the fourth quarter. It remains confident about robust growth in Mako revenues in 2023, on the back of new launches and software upgrades.The first-quarter results reflected the company’s efforts toward promoting the advanced surgery platform.Stryker is focused on continued expansion of Mako and is progressing well with it in international markets. These initiatives reflect the demand for Stryker’s unique arm-assisted robotic technology.Story continuesThe company also boasts a diversified product portfolio. Its wide range of products protects it against any significant sales shortfall during economic turmoil.Stryker’s significant exposure to robotics and artificial intelligence for healthcare and Medical Mechatronics have helped it stay ahead of the curve in the MedTech space. The company’s portfolio includes Mako as well as products for hip and knee surgeries.On its first-quarter earnings call, Stryker stated that procedural volumes continue to recover in most countries after getting adversely affected last year due to COVID-19.Although hospital staffing pressure remains in certain regions, the company expects this problem to resolve gradually. This improvement, in turn, will likely lead to higher procedures in 2023.Per management, Stryker’s constant support for customers and focus on innovation poise it for growth as the effect of the pandemic subsides. In first-quarter 2023, its adjusted research and development expenses were 6.5% of net sales, highlighting its strong commitment to innovation. According to the company, this is likely to drive new product launches.In September 2022, SYK launched a new Spine Guidance Software — Q Guidance System — for spine application. The Q Guidance system has shown promising launch uptake during the first quarter.Moreover, the company’s cost-cutting initiatives to improve margins and lessen inflationary pressure look promising. The adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses during first-quarter 2023 were 35.6% of net sales, expanding 40 basis points year over year.What’s Hurting the Stock?An unfavorable currency rate fluctuation poses a persistent threat to Stryker’s core businesses. Foreign currency had a 2.2% unfavorable impact on sales during the first quarter. The trend is likely to continue in the second half of 2023 but at a slower pace. Stryker is also facing inflationary pressure, leading to lower margins.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share is pegged at $10.16, indicating year-over-year growth of 8.8%.

232,5b9269c4-6bbf-3f18-8cc3-c01abbe6ddeb,VRSN,2023-07-04,3 Top-Tier Stocks Trading at Historical Discounts,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-tier-stocks-trading-182000297.html,1688408400,STORY,"['INMD', 'VRSN']","[Investing in high-quality businesses trading at historical discounts is a prudent strategy with the potential for market-beating returns. In this article, we will explore three such exceptional stocks that not only exhibit compelling valuations but also possess top Zacks Ranks, enhancing their near-term prospects.Visa V, renowned for its dominant position in the global financial services industry, InMode INMD, a leading player in the rapidly expanding medical aesthetics market, and VeriSign VRSN, a trusted provider of domain name registry services, all demonstrate robust business fundamentals, a track record of growing earnings, and competitive advantages within their respective sectors.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVisaVisa is the world’s leader in in credit card transactions. Visa currently processes 61% of all card based transactions in the US and 40% worldwide making it the world’s largest card processor by transaction volume.The company essentially enjoys a tax on all credit card-based purchases thanks to its incredible network. And though Visa has built out deep penetration into the world’s payment solutions, there is still plenty of room to grow. Internationally, cash is still the most popular method of payment for point-of-sale transactions at 59%, so Visa has room before the market is saturated.Visa has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings are projected to grow just 1% YoY, however FY23 earnings are expected to climb 14.4% YoY.Because of Visa’s exceptional business economics, 99% gross margins and 50% net margins, as well as industry dominance and steady earnings growth, its stock has enjoyed enviable performance. Over the last ten years it has compounded at an annual rate of 18%, far outperforming the broad market.However, in the performance chart below, we can see that the steady climb higher has slowed, and over the last three years the stock has made little progress. This creates a great opportunity for discerning investors as its valuation has had the opportunity to moderate, since the stock price has stagnated while earnings have continued to grow.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVisa is now trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 27.7x, which is below its five-year median of 30.5x and well off its high valuation of 45x. While almost 28x forward earnings isn’t a screaming discount, great companies like V rarely go on sale, so now is as good an opportunity as any.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInModeInMode is an industry leading medical technology company growing at an impressive pace. INMD has developed a diverse portfolio of minimally invasive and non-invasive devices offering innovative solutions for body contouring, skin rejuvenation, facial treatments, and women's health. By combining radiofrequency, laser, and other energy-based technologies, InMode delivers effective and customizable procedures, earning recognition among physicians worldwide.During 2022, INMD stock experienced a brutal correction of nearly -80%, however the stock has still compounded at an annual rate of 55% since its IPO.InMode has grown sales from $100 million in 2018 to nearly $500 million today, and that growth is expected to continue. FY23 sales are projected to grow 18% YoY and FY24 are expected to grow 16.4% YoY.Earnings estimates have begun to experience revisions higher giving InMode a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). FY23 earnings estimates have been revised higher by 2% and are projected to grow 12% YoY to $2.71 per share. FY24 earnings estimates have been revised higher by 1.5% and are expected to grow 13.7% YoY to $3.06 per share.Along with many other high-growth stocks, INMD experienced a painful 2022 correction. Now a year after the lows, the stock has built out a large base, from which it can begin a new bull sequence.InMode stock has bumped into selling every time the stock has traded up to the $37.50 level. But the more a level gets tested, the more likely it is to fail. If the price can trade above the $37.50 level again, it may propel the stock significantly higher. Alternatively, if it loses the $35 level, it may take some time before the next bull run.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewThe 2022 correction has also brought INMD down to a very appealing valuation. It is now trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 15.4x, which is below the industry average of 24.4x, and well below its three-year median of 31x. As a company growing at such a pace, and with the technical chart pattern as a catalyst, InMode may be setting up for a big move.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVeriSignVeriSign is a trusted provider of domain name registry services, playing a critical role in the functioning of the internet.

As internet usage and digital transformation continue to expand, VeriSign stands to benefit from the growing demand for domain names and the increased importance of online presence.VeriSign is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) demonstrated by upward trending earnings revisions. FY23 earnings estimates have been revised higher by 2.7% and are projected to grow 11% YoY to $6.92 per share. FY24 estimates have been upgraded by 4.5% and are forecast to climb 11% YoY to $7.68 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVeriSign is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 32.7x, which is just above the industry average of 31x, and below its five-year median of 37.1x. While 31x forward earnings is not a deep value investment, VRSN’s critical role in the internet all but assures its business future. And with improving earnings estimates, and a valuation below its historical median there may not be an opportunity to buy it at a cheaper valuation.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineIt is hard to go wrong buying industry-leading stocks at historical discounts.

JELD completed the sale of its Australasia business to Platinum Equity, a global investment firm. This transaction marks a significant milestone in the company's ongoing strategy to simplify operations and maximize shareholder value.With the completion of the Australasia business sale, JELD is now poised to concentrate its efforts on its primary regions, North America and Europe, bolstering its financial position. The transaction generated nearly $446 million in net proceeds for the company, which will be utilized to repay debt.In fiscal 2022, JELD-WEN reported $4.5 billion net revenues, with the North America and Europe segments accounting for 72% and 28%, respectively, excluding the Australasia business.Focus on North America &amp; Europe RegionsDuring first-quarter fiscal 2023, JELD surpassed internal expectations with strong sales and earnings performance. The positive outcome was primarily attributed to favorable volume and price cost outcomes, particularly in the North American market. Additionally, lower cost inflation in Europe contributed to improved earnings during the period.The North America segment reported sales of $768 million in the first quarter, up 6% compared with prior-year quarter’s levels. The segment's adjusted EBITDA rose 18% to $79 million, with margins improving by 100 basis points to 10.3%, driven by positive price cost results.The company's Europe segment reported $312 million revenues and adjusted EBITDA of $18 million marking a 20% increase from the year-ago quarter’s levels.

The objective is to achieve sales and customer service efficiency targets, and enhance pricing strategies through country-level analysis.Furthermore, JELD-WEN continues its efforts to optimize network footprint, focusing on enhancing production planning and execution.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Eagle Materials Inc. EXP, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM, Vulcan Materials Co. VMC and Summit Materials, Inc. SUM.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Construction Boom to Boost Concrete StocksConcrete and aggregates are essentially building materials, and so, are closely linked to the construction market, whether residential or commercial. The current situation of rising rates and persistent inflation are negative for this industry as it is for others. However, market dynamics indicate strong growth prospects in the next few years, as well as in the long term. Therefore, it should figure in your portfolios at this time. Read on to know more: Increasing Homebuilding DemandIt is no secret that we currently have a housing shortage.Just this week, there was some disappointing data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), which said that its pending home sales index dropped 2.7% in May. Moreover, pending transactions were down 22.2% on the year. The NAR's pending home sales index (base year 2001) measures housing contract activity based on signed real estate contracts for existing single-family homes, condos and co-ops. It is therefore a leading indicator of housing market activity.The main reason for the softness is lack of available inventory, both new and existing. The high interest rates are keeping out existing inventory, although tax incentives may alleviate this situation.While interest rates are also increasing costs for builders, these companies are incentivized by strong demand. As may be expected in any high demand scenario, home prices are increasing again. According to the latest S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, home prices increased for the third straight month in April (the latest data). Prices were up across all of the 20 cities tracked.Story continuesGovernment Infrastructure Spending PlanThe Biden administration's $1.2 trillion infrastructure plan that includes funding for roads and bridges ($110 billion), public transit ($39 billion, including modernization and repairs as well as provisions for the elderly and those with disabilities) broadband internet ($65 billion, includes a $30 a month subsidy to 1 in 4 Americans for high speed access), the electric grid ($108 billion), EVs ($7.5 billion), clean drinking water ($55 billion to change all the piping), airports ($25 billion), etc. Therefore, there's a whole lot in there to do with construction activity, all of which will greatly increase demand for concrete and aggregates.Repair &amp; Remodel in Full SwingThe last 10 years have seen the sale of 5-6 million existing homes each year. An NAR report from last year talks about the average age of homes being 39 years. Obviously, as homes age, they require more repair. Additionally, changing lifestyles require different setups, for which more significant alterations may be required.Rising home prices and higher interest rates are also a deterrent to getting a new house. As a result, people may be more inclined to remodel what they already have. Another factor that plays a role is the kind of buyers. Millennials are more focused on value because their cost of living and student debt among other things leave them less cash to spare. To buy an existing home and remodel it according to their requirements could be an attractive proposition for them. According to JP Morgan's 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook, ""E-commerce will likely serve as a tailwind for the logistics industry—and industrial warehouse and distribution properties—for at least 10 years... The industry has begun to respond and deliver record amounts of new warehouses."" The retail space is also likely to see some changes since malls and other locations that thrived from officegoer traffic are struggling to meet their financial commitments. Some cities are repurposing their Grade B and C malls to include restaurants, movie theaters and experiential retail. Manufacturing infrastructure and data center growth are other drivers.Additionally, global economic growth with its focus on infrastructure modernization/sustainability, energy transition and national security, as well as growing urbanization across the world are secular drivers of this industry. These initiatives will require the construction of new buildings, transportation networks, and renewable energy projects, all of which rely on concrete and aggregates.Near-term DynamicsIn the near term, there could be persistent challenges related to the supply chain, which would be negative for material costs as well as transportation and logistics. The higher interest rates are also increasing the cost of borrowing. Additionally, in the current environment, many companies engaged in construction activity are having issues with the availability of raw materials and availability and skill of their labor force. This also slows down consumption of construction materials like concrete and aggregates.Given the positive outlook overall, there are many companies to choose from. I've picked four:Eagle Materials Inc.Dallas, TX-based Eagle Materials, manufactures and sells heavy construction materials and light building materials in the U.S. Its four operating segments are Cement, Concrete and Aggregates, Gypsum Wallboard, and Recycled Paperboard.Having topped March quarter estimates by 18.7%, Eagle Materials is seeing solid estimate revisions. The current year (ending March 2024) estimate has increased 7.9% in the last 60 days, representing 8.4% growth for the year. The estimate for the following year is up 7.8%, representing 9.4% growth.Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.Raleigh, NC-based Martin Marietta is a natural resource-based building materials company, supplying crushed stone, sand and gravel products, as well as ready mixed concrete and asphalt; paving products and services; and Portland and specialty cement.Martin Marietta beat estimates by 118.2% in the last quarter. In the last 60 days, there is an 8.4% increase in its 2023 estimate and a 7.5% increase in its 2024 estimate. At the current level, 2023 earnings are expected to grow 33.1% while 2024 earnings are expected to grow 13.9%.Vulcan Materials Co.Birmingham, AL-based Vulcan produces and supplies construction aggregates primarily in the U.S. It operates through four segments: Aggregates, Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium.The company's 2023 estimate has increased 11.1% while the 2024 estimate increased 9.7% in the last 60 Days. Analysts are projecting 27.6% earnings growth this year and 18.4% growth in the next. This may well be achievable given the 48.4% earnings beat in the last quarter.Summit Materials, Inc.Denver, CO-based Summit is a vertically integrated construction materials company offering aggregates, cement, ready-mix concrete, asphalt paving mixes, and concrete products, as well as plastics components through operating three segments: West, East and Cement.After the solid performance in the last quarter, wherein Summit Materials posted a positive surprise of 31.6%, analysts are incrementally optimistic about this stock. They've raised their 2023 estimate 5.0% and their 2024 estimate 6.6%. That means, they expect earnings to grow 16.5% in 2023 and 19.8% in 2024.EXP, MLM and VMC are ranked #1 (Strong Buy) by Zacks.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The strategy underperformed its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Value Index, in the first quarter. On an absolute basis, the strategy gained from 5 of the 11 sectors in which it was invested for the quarter. The information technology (IT) and communication services sectors were the leading contributors while health care and financials sectors detracted.

Progressive continues to demonstrate superior underwriting practices with consistent share gains in the personal auto insurance market while maintaining strong profitability. The company pioneered the use of in-vehicle telematics, providing it with a substantial amount of differentiated user data that it uses to reward better drivers while also reducing its risk of losses. These data-driven insights enabled Progressive to lead the industry in raising prices to offset higher losses. Subsequently, as competitors have been forced to sharply raise prices in order to restore profitability, customers have shopped for better rates and Progressive has been able to accelerate its market share gains. The company has a conservative investment portfolio, which we believe is likely to prove defensive in a softer macro environment.""Story continuesfinancial, client, officeAdam Gregor/Shutterstock.comThe Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

The move is likely to pull in more shoppers to this well-known retail destination, boding well for Macerich.Shares of MAC, however, declined marginally on Jun 30 regular trading session on the NYSE.Primark is located in Center Court next to another prominent international retailer, scheduled for a Fall 2023 opening at Green Acres. Both these retailers will replace the former JCPenney site, highlighting MAC’s efforts centered on the re-use and mixed-use of its properties through the recapture and repositioning of anchor tenants.With this latest opening, Primark has seven stores at various Macerich’s shopping centers. Its stores at MAC’s Kings Plaza (Brooklyn), Danbury Fair (Connecticut), Fashion District Philadelphia and Freehold Raceway Mall (New Jersey) are already functional. The company is also slated to soon step into MAC’s Queens Center (Brooklyn) and Tysons Corner Center (McClean, Virginia).Moreover, the mall, spanning more than 2 million square feet, is advantageously located in Valley Stream, NY, and offers a wide variety of desirable shopping, dining and entertainment brands. MAC’s latest addition to this popular-retail destination is expected to boost sales and traffic, making the move a strategic fit.Per F.K. Grunert, executive vice president, Leasing, Macerich, “Primark has won over millions of shoppers around the world with its global style for fashion and the home, and we’re excited to be part of Primark’s plan to have 60 U.S. stores by 2026.”Amid renewed enthusiasm in consumers’ preference for an in-person shopping experience following the pandemic downtime, this retail REIT’s portfolio of premium assets in the United States has experienced healthy leasing activity.Also, with mixed-used assets having gained traction in recent years, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT) has been making concerted efforts to ring in premium brands at its properties to drive more footfall and boost sales.In May 2023, MAC acquired the remaining 50% interest in five former Sears boxes from its joint venture partner — Seritage Growth Properties — and now wholly owns and controls each parcel.  The five Sears boxes, encompassing a total gross leasable area of 819,000 square feet, are located in the company’s regional town centers and provide it the flexibility to undertake redevelopment opportunities at these properties and enrich them with premium in-demand retailers.In the same month, Macerich and Wish You Were Here Group, a renowned, multi-concept hospitality company, announced that the south wing of Scottsdale Fashion Square will house the upscale, experiential restaurant concept — Élephante.The move will mark Élephante’s first location outside Los Angeles. It will encompass 12,000 square feet of Macerich’s top-performing shopping center, aiming to provide a multidimensional experience to the Scottsdale community.Nonetheless, growing e-commerce adoption and limited consumers’ willingness to spend amid macroeconomic uncertainty and a high interest rate environment pose concerns for the company in the near term.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 8% in the past three months compared with its industry's growth of 3.9%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Kite Realty Group Trust KRG, Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT and Saul Centers BFS, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ORLY for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?O'Reilly Automotive's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at O'Reilly Automotive's main business drivers.O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. is a leading specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States. Founded in 1957, O'Reilly’s initially operated from a single store in Springfield, MO. The company’s stores offer several services and programs to customers, which include battery diagnostic testing, check engine light code extraction and loaner tool program, among others. The products offered by the company stores are vehicle accessories, such as floor mats and seat cover as well as maintenance items like antifreeze, engine additives, filters, fluids, lighting and wiper blades. Besides these, it provides new as well as remanufactured automotive hard parts like alternators, batteries, brake system components, belts, chassis parts, driveline parts, engine parts and fuel pumps.The company sells products to both Do-it-Yourself (DIY) customers and Do-it-for-Me (DIFM) or professional installers. It sells an extensive line of products consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts (such as mufflers, brakes and shock absorbers), maintenance items, accessories, a complete range of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service equipment. The company has a track record of over 40 years of following a dual-market strategy by serving both DIY and DIFM customers and is among the top three companies in both the markets.Story continuesThe automotive aftermarket items industry is a highly competitive industry. O'Reilly’s presence in the market, customer service, product availability, store location, brand recognition price and store location position the company in a competitive position in the market among peers in the industry. The company’s omnichannel growth strategies are focused on offering customers an enhanced and seamless shopping experience through variety of digital and physical channels. The auto retailer has been expanding its physical presence through opening or acquiring stores while maintaining the existing ones. As of Dec 31, 2022, O’Reilly’s total store count was 5,971.Bottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For O'Reilly Automotive, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in July 2013 would be worth $8,482.51, or a 748.25% gain, as of July 3, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 177.06% and gold's return of 49.67% over the same time frame.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for ORLY.O’Reilly has been generating record revenues since 30 consecutive years on the back of growth in auto parts market. For 2023, O’Reilly projects total revenues within $15.2-$15.5 billion, up from $14.41 billion generated in 2022. It is poised to benefit from store openings and distribution centers in profitable regions. O’Reilly’s diverse product portfolio catering to DIY and DIFM customers are driving comps growth. Mayasa Auto Parts buyout, O’Reilly’s first international expansion transaction, bolstered growth prospects. But rising SG&amp;A costs led by store expansion and omni-channel goals are hurting margins. Distribution, labor and logistic bottlenecks are weighing down the firm’s prospects. High debts levels also play a spoilsport.  Thus the stock warrants a cautious stance now.The stock has jumped 6.70% over the past four weeks.

255,a4ace631-87de-3b03-9828-dbc7163a69b4,CSCO,2023-07-04,10 Stocks Jumping On The Generative AI Wagon,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-stocks-jumping-generative-ai-224432918.html,1688424272,STORY,"['AI', 'CSCO', 'AMZN', 'ACN', 'TRI', 'NVDA', 'IBM', 'SNOW']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at 10 stocks jumping on the generative AI wagon. To skip our detailed analysis of the developments taking place within the AI sector, you can go directly to read about the 5 Stocks Jumping On The Generative AI Wagon.The markets have been overwhelmingly influenced by artificial intelligence (AI) and, within it, generative AI this year. Every company is entering the AI race in fear of being left behind in the face of rapid technological changes and advancements, while those companies who were already part of the AI sector have been enjoying quite a boost in light of their head start on others. With AI becoming such an integral part of the economy today, it is unsurprising to see how companies are trying to jump on the AI bandwagon.Recent AI Deals and ProgramsAs noted on CNBC's TechCheck on June 27 recent partnership between Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was announced this June, which highlighted the former's intentions to try and benefit from the latter's growing influence within the AI space. The partnership aims to make advanced AI capabilities available to enterprises. By combining Snowflake Inc.'s (NYSE:SNOW) ability to manage massive amounts of data with NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU-accelerated computing and NeMo platform, which develops large language models (LLMs), the partnership will help businesses use their data to make custom LLMs for generative AI services. These include AI chatbots like ChatGPT and search and summarization services as well.Another AI deal in the spotlight today is Thomson Reuters Corporation's (NYSE:TRI) $650 million acquisition of Castext, a company that develops AI-powered legal workflows. Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) is aiming to make generative AI solutions available to its customers through this deal. Another AI deal that has become the talk of the markets is the Databricks acquisition of MosaicML for $1.3 billion. Through MosaicML, you can train and deploy LLMs and other generative AI models in your data in a secure environment. MosaicML has been considered a rival to OpenAI, meaning that with this acquisition, Databricks has also joined the generative AI race.Story continues""Pioneers Need To Be Willing To Be Misunderstood For Long Periods Of Time""CNBC showed on June 22 that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also announced a $100 million program through which it hopes to help its customers use generative AI. The markets have been viewing Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a lagger in the generative AI space so far, so this move may seem to some as a way to rectify this image. The company may be attempting to mark its own territory within this space by signaling to other big tech competitors that it is now working to bring generative AI tools and models to its cloud customers through Amazon Web Services. Here are some comments on this move from Adam Selipsky, the CEO of Amazon Web Services:""The reality of it is that Amazon has been working on artificial intelligence, as mentioned earlier, for longer than almost any of these companies. We have long accumulated experience, we have many, many experts, thousands of practioners of different kinds inside the company. Many of those experts are now working specifically on generative AI. Nobody else has the full stack of capabilities that we're putting together.""Selipsky also mentioned in his CNBC interview that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is now also working on developing its own ""machine learning, AI-specific chips"" alongside several other projects within the AI space. It was noted that other companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have been receiving more recognition on Wall Street for their AI contributions, particularly in generative AI, to which Selipsky responded that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a saying which goes ""pioneers have to be willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time."" He elaborated on this by saying that the company has many past examples which show that it was more focused on its customers and building what they want, adding that if that led to misconceptions about the company's trajectory, that was alright, as long as its customers understood where it was going. In light of this, Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) move to make generative AI available to its customers now may begin to make more sense to Wall Street as this shows how the company is once again trying its best to meet customer needs.The above-mentioned deals, acquisitions, and programs highlight how many companies are trying to enter the generative AI race by partnering with other companies using generative AI. We have elaborated on more of these companies below in our list to show which generative AI stocks the markets should be watching today.10 Stocks Jumping On The Generative AI WagonPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyWe have selected stocks that have recently been making moves to join the AI sector, particularly the generative AI area, for our list below. We used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter to rank these stocks from the lowest to the highest number of hedge funds holding stakes in them.Stocks Jumping On The Generative AI Wagon10. Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) is a research and consulting services company based in Toronto, Canada. The company provides business information services internationally.This June, Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) agreed to acquire Casetext for $650 million. Casetext is a legal AI company that develops AI-powered legal workflows. Steve Hasker, the CEO of Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) commented that this acquisition would be part of the company's ""build, partner, and buy strategy"" through which it can bring generative AI solutions to its customers.There were 16 hedge funds long Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $144 million.Tim Casey, an analyst at BMO Capital, maintains an Outperform rating on Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) as of June 28. The analyst also raised his price target from $184 to $192.Junto Capital Management was the largest shareholder in Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) at the end of the first quarter, holding 268,335 shares in the company.9. C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Our hedge fund data for the first quarter shows 24 funds holding stakes in C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI). Their total stake value in the company was $151 million.C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) is an information technology company based in Redwood City, California. The company has developed a new enterprise search tool powered by language models similar to those powering ChatGPT. C3.ai, Inc.'s (NYSE:AI) search bar retrieves answers from an organization's own knowledge base and can summarize this information while also citing its sources.On June 1, Daniel Ives at Wedbush upgraded C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) shares from Neutral to Outperform while also raising his price target on the stock from $24 to $50.Kerrisdale Capital mentioned C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) in its March investor letter:“We are short shares of C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), a $4 billion market capitalization enterprise software company that has risen from the ashes of its busted IPO based on the misconception that its self-proclaimed “AI leadership” somehow positions it to benefit from Silicon Valley’s current tech theme du jour: generative AI as represented by media obsession ChatGPT. We believe these speculative flames won’t burn bright much longer, as the realities of C3’s poor customer traction, failing sales partnerships, and financial pressures will catalyze what is likely to be a painful reality check.This isn’t the first time C3 has sought to ride a hot investment theme. The company was originally founded as C3 Energy to develop analytics solutions for public utilities preparing for the emergence of cap-and-trade and smart grids. C3 pivoted in 2016, renaming the company C3 IoT to capitalize on that buzzy opportunity. But management’s master stroke was rebranding operations as C3.ai in 2019 and going public with the “AI” stock ticker, thus securing its place as the default artificial intelligence stock play for the undiscriminating investor despite the bulk of its business coming from relatively dated analytics models built for a very small number of utility, energy, and government customers. C3 is a minor, cash-burning consulting and services business masquerading as a software company, and its true value is a fraction of its current market capitalization…” (Click here to read the full text)C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), like Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), is a stock that might see more upside because of its involvement in generative AI.8. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Credit Suisse analyst Shannon Cross reiterated an Outperform rating on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) on June 26 alongside a $162 price target.Citadel Investment Group held 3.1 million shares in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) at the end of the first quarter, making it the most prominent shareholder in the company for that quarter.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is another information technology company on our list. It is based in Armonk, New York. The company launched a new generative AI platform, Watsonx, this May for businesses. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) believes Watsonx can help businesses manage their own AI-supported data while ensuring their data is secure and in compliance with regulatory and ethical requirements.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was spotted in the portfolios of 49 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $1.5 billion.7. Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60In June, Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN), an information technology company, acquired Flutura, an industrial AI company based in India, to help boost its own industrial AI services. It has also launched a new AI Navigator for Enterprise, a generative AI-based platform that will help its clients define business cases, make decisions, and more.We saw Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) in the 13F holdings of 60 hedge funds during the first quarter. Their total stake value was $2.8 billion.An Outperform rating was reiterated on Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) shares on June 23 by Daniel Perlin, an analyst at RBC Capital, who also holds a $340 price target on the stock.In its first-quarter 2023 investor letter, Polen Capital said the following about Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN):“To fund this new purchase, we made modest trims to our positions in Aon and Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN). In order to fund the purchase of, and subsequent addition to, Teleperformance, we modestly trimmed our positions in Aon and Accenture. We trimmed our weighting in Aon, though it remains a top three weighting in the Portfolio. We believed there was room to trim the position after significant relative outperformance by the stock in 2022. There is no change to our positive outlook for this business. We also trimmed our weighting in Accenture, our second trim in the past four months, as the company returns to a normal growth trajectory after an extended stretch of robust results brought about by the pandemic. In addition to growth normalizing, we see increased signs of slowing enterprise tech spending. We continue to believe Accenture is well positioned to grow in line with historical performance, meaning we see the business producing low-double digit total return growth from here.”Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN), like Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), is a stock to watch in light of generative AI developments.6. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61On June 30, Jim Suva at Citigroup initiated coverage on Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) with a Neutral rating and a $54 price target.In the first quarter, 61 hedge funds were long Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO).

(NASDAQ:CSCO) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We had one sale this quarter, exiting network equipment company Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO). We chose to use the proceeds on more attractive value opportunities as Cisco’s growth has come in below what we had hoped for, and the company is increasingly looking at M&amp;A to augment its growth rate.”Click to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks Jumping On The Generative AI WagonSuggested articles:Top 10 Generative Artificial Intelligence Companies to Invest In10 AI Stocks Billionaires are Loading Up On10 Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI BoomDisclosure: None. 10 Stocks Jumping On The Generative AI Wagon is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
