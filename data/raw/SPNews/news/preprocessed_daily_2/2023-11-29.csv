Extracting information from all 4 sources brought our total count to 20. Of the 20, the common financial ratios were selected and ranked based on the number of times an item appeared across the 4 sources. If an item appeared in all four sources, it was awarded with an insider monkey score of 4. The list is in ascending order of the number of mentions across all four sources.

The return on assets ratio (ROA) is calculated by dividing the net income of a company by its total assets for a certain fiscal period. The profitability ratio is a strong indicator of how well the company is utilizing its resources and assets to earn a profit.

The price-to-sales ratio (P/S) indicates how much a market values every dollar of the company's sales.

The dividend yield ratio indicates how much a company pays out in dividends each year against its market value per share. The dividend yield ratio is calculated by dividing the annual dividends per share by the price per share. Usually, the ratio is expressed as a percentage by multiplying the ratio by 100. The dividend yield ratio may indicate how efficiently a company distributes its profit to its shareholders. A high dividend ratio may be attractive for shareholders.

A high P/E ratio suggests that a company's stock price is high against its earnings, and vice versa for a low P/E ratio.

An inventory turnover ratio between 5-10 may suggest that the company is able to sell its inventory within 1 to 2 months.

These companies are most suitable for vulnerable investors with a low knowledge of the stock market, like retirees, widows, and orphans. The term was coined in the 1930s for stocks that are mature enough to weather economic turbulence. Widow and orphan stocks is an outdated term for low-volatility investments.', 'One of the most attractive features of widow and orphan stocks is that these companies have the ability to maintain their dividend payments during tough times.

These companies have stable growth, but in a bull market, these stocks cannot take advantage of favorable market conditions like growth stocks due to their low volatility. This might not apply to a few companies on our list, such as Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), as these companies have recorded major profits and losses in the last few decades.

The latest round of 13-F filings revealed that Burry’s Scion Capital Management shorted Blackrock’s (NYSE:BLK) iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) with\xa0100,000\xa0Put options. The nominal value of Burry’s short position stands at approximately $47 million, which is nearly half of Scion’s liquidity. As such, I think it’s safe to say that Burry’s semiconductor short is a conviction play.', 'SOXX ETF has a concentrated portfolio, with its top ten holdings spanning nearly 60% of its asset base. Therefore, I have reason to believe that Burry’s trade targeted a few of the big chip makers instead of the industry as a whole.', 'Although I’m not overly bearish on chip makers, I think a few will retrace in the following quarters. Let’s discuss three chip stocks to sell.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com', 'Michael Burry isn’t the only noteworthy market participant with a bearish outlook on Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). In fact, David Tepper’s\xa0Appaloosa recently disposed\xa0of its Broadcom position. Moreover, Broadcom’s more than\xa075% year-to-date surge\xa0has led to an abrupt increase in AVGO\xa0stock’s put/call ratio, which currently sits above three. Therefore, it appears like many tactical investors are starting to downscale their Broadcom bets by either hedging or short selling.', 'Furthermore, Broadcom is in the midst of an acquisition. The firm is set to acquire VMware (NYSE:VMW) for\xa0$69 billion, subject to final regulatory approval. Although VMware may add long-term value, Broadcom’s stock could suffer from\xa0merger arbitrage, a market-based anomaly that says acquiring companies’ stocks tend to drop after an acquisition before regaining momentum once synergies occur. Thus, I believe the VMWare deal presents additional substance to a short-term revision in Broadcom’s stock price.', 'Lastly, key metrics suggest that AVGO stock is cyclically overvalued. For example, the stock’s price-to-sales ratio of\xa011.63x is nearly 67% higher\xa0than its 5-year average. In addition, Broadcom’s enterprise value-to-earnings before interest and tax multiple of 21.56x is more than 33% higher than its 5-year average.

However, as illustrated by its recent performance, the stock is in a tizzy and probably worth staying away from for the time being.', 'As already mentioned, Texas Instruments suffered a third-quarter revenue miss. The company’s top line settled at\xa0$4.53 billion, missing by $56.13 million. Much of the firm’s quarterly headwinds stemmed from weakening industrial production, which could remain a concern as the economy resumes its decendance. Furthermore, Texas Instruments’ quarterly net income slumped by\xa026% to $1.7 billion, indicating that lower global input costs were not sufficient to save Texas Instruments’ bottom line.', 'Another factor to consider is that many investors hold exposure to Texas Instruments as a “bird in hand” play. The firm has escalated its dividend payouts for\xa020 straight years compounded at 25% annually, placing TXN stock’s dividend yield at\xa03.32%. However, diminishing industrial demand and resilient input costs have sent the stock’s\xa0free cash flow margin\xa0into negative territory.

The company released its fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, revealing an earnings miss of one cent per share. Furthermore, the firm’s management provided an underwhelming first-quarter outlook with a revenue estimate of $2.5 billion. If the outlook is realized, Analog’s first-quarter revenue would be 8% lower quarter-on-quarter, trivially leading to an unwanted scenario.', 'In a similar vein to Texas Instruments, Analog suffered from waning industrial demand during its third quarter. The segment’s quarterly revenue landed just shy of\xa0$1.7 billion, a 20% year-over-year decline. Although Analog Devices’ quarterly automotive revenue grew by 14% year-over-year, its communications and consumer revenue dipped by 32% and 28% apiece, conveying near firm-wide demand struggles.', 'Even though I foresee a recovery in Analog Devices’ communication revenue, the interest rate cycle has a long way to go before industrial and automotive demand hits sustainable levels. Sure, ADI stock’s price-to-earnings ratio of 24.69x isn’t bad for a growth stock.

It is preferred by many investors while handpicking stocks trading at a bargain. However, even this straightforward, broadly used valuation metric has a few downsides.', 'While P/E enjoys great popularity among value investors, a less-used and more complicated metric called EV-to-EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative. EV-to-EBITDA gives the true picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential. It has a more comprehensive approach to valuation.', 'JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd., PVH Corp., Titan Machinery Inc., ADT Inc. and Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.', 'Also referred to as enterprise multiple, EV-to-EBITDA is the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents. In essence, it is the entire value of a company.', 'EBITDA, the other element of the ratio, gives a clearer picture of a company’s profitability as it strips out non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.', 'Generally, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more enticing it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could indicate that a stock is potentially undervalued.', 'Unlike the P/E ratio, EV-to-EBITDA takes debt on a company’s balance sheet into account. For this reason, it is typically used to value potential acquisition targets. The ratio shows the amount of debt that the acquirer has to bear. Stocks flaunting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.', 'Moreover, P/E can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. A firm’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. In contrast, EV-to-EBITDA is harder to manipulate and can be used to value companies that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA front.', 'EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.', 'However, EV-to-EBITDA is also not without its shortcomings and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock’s inherent potential and future performance. The ratio varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital spending requirements.', 'As such, instead of just relying on EV-to-EBITDA, you can club it with the other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to achieve the desired results.', 'Here are our five picks out of the eight stocks that passed the screen:', 'JinkoSolar is one of the leading solar module manufacturers, which distributes its solar products to a diversified international utility, commercial and residential customer base globally.

EV-to-EBITDA gives the true picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential. It has a more comprehensive approach to valuation. \xa0JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. JKS, PVH Corp. PVH, Titan Machinery Inc. TITN, ADT Inc. ADT and Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. PK are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.', 'Also referred to as enterprise multiple, EV-to-EBITDA is the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents. In essence, it is the entire value of a company.EBITDA, the other element of the ratio, gives a clearer picture of a company’s profitability as it strips out non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Generally, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more enticing it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could indicate that a stock is potentially undervalued. \xa0Unlike the P/E ratio, EV-to-EBITDA takes debt on a company’s balance sheet into account. For this reason, it is typically used to value potential acquisition targets. The ratio shows the amount of debt that the acquirer has to bear. Stocks flaunting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Moreover, P/E can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. A firm’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. In contrast, EV-to-EBITDA is harder to manipulate and can be used to value companies that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA front.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.However, EV-to-EBITDA is also not without its shortcomings and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock’s inherent potential and future performance. The ratio varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital spending requirements.As such, instead of just relying on EV-to-EBITDA, you can club it with the other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to achieve the desired results.', ""Here are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks:EV-to-EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV-to-EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the stock is, as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are our five picks out of the eight stocks that passed the screen:JinkoSolar is one of the leading solar module manufacturers, which distributes its solar products to a diversified international utility, commercial and residential customer base globally.

To skip the detailed analysis of widow and orphan stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy.', 'Widow and orphan stocks are well-established blue-chip companies that pay out stable dividends, have low volatility, and grow steadily over time. These companies are most suitable for vulnerable investors with a low knowledge of the stock market, like retirees, widows, and orphans. The term was coined in the 1930s for stocks that are mature enough to weather economic turbulence. Widow and orphan stocks is an outdated term for low-volatility investments.', 'One of the most attractive features of widow and orphan stocks is that these companies have the ability to maintain their dividend payments during tough times. For example, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been increasing its dividend for the past 67 years, which means that the company was able to sustain itself through several recessions, including the Black Monday of 1987, The Great Financial Crisis, and the COVID-19 recessions along with the aftermath of Russia-Ukraine war.', 'While widow and orphan stocks might be considered safe investments, they still have their drawbacks. These companies have stable growth, but in a bull market, these stocks cannot take advantage of favorable market conditions like growth stocks due to their low volatility. This might not apply to a few companies on our list, such as Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), as these companies have recorded major profits and losses in the last few decades. However, these oil Supermajors have still maintained their dividends for decades despite heavy losses suffered in 2016 and 2020 as they are fundamentally strong.', 'The stock market has performed better than expected in 2023 as the S&P 500 is up over 19%, and the NASDAQ-100 is up 47.5% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of writing on November 28. Despite the strong performance due to the boom in the technology sector, some analysts still believe that a recession could hit the US economy in 2024. If we consider their prediction, investing in safe and stable companies like the widow and orphan stocks can safeguard investments. Widow and orphan stocks are also perfect investments for beginners with little knowledge of the stock market.', 'Some of the best widow and orphan stocks include Walmart Inc.

Since stability is commonly associated with trust, countries that persist in stable conditions tend to be more trusted. Democratic countries which are characterized by more transparency and personal freedom are also deemed trustworthy. Institutions such as government, business, and media are the key influencing factors behind trust acknowledged in countries around the world. As reported by the Global Trustworthiness Index in 2022,\xa0 politicians, cabinet officers, and advertising executives have been the least trusted professions around the world. Simultaneously, you can view the most trusted professions particular to the United States.', 'The trust level in a nation’s key institutions has evolved. Currently, business is the sole institution that is seen as competent and trustworthy. Governments have been less trusted as compared to businesses by being a source of false or misleading information. As for the media, the trust level has been declining due to the cycle of distrust that has come into existence following biased news stories. This has led to global polarization based on distrust in government, lack of shared identity, systematic unfairness, and reduced confidence in the media. As reported by Edelman Trust Barometer, the majority of the countries believe that they are more divided as compared to the past while government leaders and journalists were considered as a dividing force pulling people apart. Some of the predicted consequences of this polarization in countries include a degradation in the judicial system, weakened economic growth, street violence as well and an inability to solve societal issues as a nation.', 'Amidst mistrust penetrating the world, several companies continue to earn a reputation by serving their stakeholders well.

However, many companies have been failing to uphold their part of the bargain, costing employees millions of dollars.', ""To quote an example, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) has recently agreed to pay $61 million to settle claims for its under-performing retirement plan. The lawsuit alleged that five of the retirement funds managed by General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)'s Asset Management (GEAM) were the only options that retirement plan participants were offered. Since 2011, these funds have under-performed in comparison to other investment options, resulting in employees suffering a loss of $283 million."", ""As per the plaintiffs, comprising 250,000 employees who invested in one of the five contested mutual funds between Sept. 26, 2011, and Aug. 3, 2023, General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) is alleged to have violated its fiduciary duty and contravened the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) is also due to pay $4.5 million to settle a lawsuit concerning the company's 401(k) plan. The insurance company MetLife, Inc.

(NYSE:MET) index funds from July 19, 2015, to Dec. 31, 2021. Even Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) has settled a $30 million lawsuit over its 401(k) plan.

In the context of choosing the best places to retire in the world, it is increasingly becoming important for individuals to assess the fiduciary practices of their financial institutions before investing in their retirement savings.', 'Once you’ve decided to retire with or without significant retirement savings, the next question on your list is probably where to retire. High inflation and limited budgets may push you to relocate to cheaper areas within the country, or even lead you towards a retirement abroad.

Many areas within these countries are so cheap that you can even retire on $800 a month.', 'But are these countries easy to retire to?

If you want to skip our overview of the gold industry and some recent developments, then take a look at the 5 Most Undervalued Gold Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. ', ""The gold industry is one of the most interesting sectors on the stock market. This is because while most industries, save the banking sector, deal with the needs of either financial or non financial customers, gold companies sell their products for both investment and general use purposes. Gold is one of the oldest safe haven assets in the world, with its rarity and use in jewelry ascribing it a higher price than other metals such as copper. Its use as a financial assets has also made the gold industry quite important these days, particularly after the significant financial turmoil that we've seen in global equities and bond markets."", 'This turmoil has come in the wake of rapid interest rate hikes by central banks to clamp down on inflation. The interest rate increases are nothing short of historic, and they have continued to cause disruption in the bond market as securities issued during an era of lower rates have dropped in value. Since global central banks hold U.S. Treasury bonds as their assets, this rapid drop in value has seen them scurry to diversify their portfolios and ensure that the value does not significantly fluctuate.\\', ""Don't Miss: Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now"", ""Data from the World Gold Council shows that as of September 2023, central banks had bought 35 tons of gold on average per month year to date. This means that the banks have bought 315 tons this year, and leading the pack are Asian and European countries. The bulk of these purchases come from developing or emerging markets, and the top three central bank gold purchasers in September were Chinese, Polish, and Uzbekistani banks. However, among these, only China and Poland remained net purchases while Uzbekistan rebuilt some of its gold assets that it has continued to sell this year. So far, China has added roughly 200 tons to its portfolio, and with 2023 coming to an end, it'll be interesting to see how one of the biggest economies in the world closes out its gold holdings."", ""One of the key reasons why central banks buy gold is when the U.S. dollar surges in value and causes their own currencies to depreciate. In a high interest rate era, the dollar is the ultimate safe haven asset even though gold might be shinier. This is because while gold might be a store of value, it does not pay interest which naturally leads to stronger demand for the dollar. Yet, since not everyone can benefit from higher interest rates offered by U.S. Treasuries or bank accounts, the demand for gold naturally remains high when economies are slowing down. Gold now accounts for 4% of China's reserves, and data also shows that a large portion of the gold bought by the country comes from regular people who are looking to protect their wealth amidst a weak Chinese economy and a depreciating currency."", 'The tight link of gold with global financial markets also makes it a barometer of sorts for global risk appetite. While the dollar reigns supreme in a high rate environment, as soon as investors sniff rate cuts, it drops and gold starts to rise. This is also the case at the tail end of November, as gold prices have now hit a six month high to trade at $2,013.99 ahead of a crucial inflation report that is widely believed to cement the end of the era of interest rate hikes.', ""With gold prices rising and central banks piling into the metal, gold companies are also making billions. For instance, here's what the management of Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) shared during its latest earnings call:"", 'In the first nine months, we generated nearly $1.2 billion of operating cashflow, and after reinvesting in our operations and project pipeline, we generated over $400 million of free cashflow.

Tasiast had a record production quarter, producing 171,000 ounces, was once again our highest cashflow operation. Paracatu also performed well in the third quarter, and as planned, had its highest production quarter of the year. La Coipa was once again our lowest cost operation and also generated strong cashflow.

Srinivas Tallapragada's recent sale of 10,000 shares follows a pattern of selling on his part, with a total of 287,538 shares sold over the past year and no purchases. This consistent selling could be part of a planned selling program or due to personal financial management rather than a lack of confidence in the company's future."", ""When analyzing the relationship between insider selling and the stock price, it's crucial to look at the broader market conditions and company performance. Salesforce's stock price of $225.32 on the day of Tallapragada's sale gives the company a market cap of $218.85 billion, reflecting a significant size and influence in the market."", ""The price-earnings ratio of 141.46 is higher than the industry median, suggesting that the market has high expectations for Salesforce's earnings growth. However, it's lower than the company's historical median, indicating that the stock might not be as overvalued as it has been in the past."", ""Adding another layer to the valuation analysis, the price-to-GF-Value ratio stands at 0.84, with the GF Value at $269.58. This indicates that Salesforce Inc is modestly undervalued based on GuruFocus's intrinsic value estimate, which considers historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates."", ""The insider trend image above provides a visual representation of the selling pattern, which could be interpreted in various ways. While the consistent selling might be concerning to some, it's essential to remember that insiders might have diverse reasons for selling that don't necessarily reflect their outlook on the company's future."", ""The GF Value image further supports the notion that Salesforce's stock might be undervalued. This discrepancy between the market price and the GF Value could present an opportunity for investors who believe in the company's long-term growth potential, despite the insider selling activity."", ""In conclusion, the recent insider sell by Srinivas Tallapragada at Salesforce Inc is a development that warrants attention. While the pattern of insider selling over the past year could be seen as a negative signal, the company's valuation metrics suggest that the stock may still be a good investment. Investors should weigh the insider activity against other factors such as Salesforce's market position, future growth prospects, and overall market conditions before making any investment decisions."", 'As always, insider transactions are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to evaluating a stock.

But the supply of existing homes will still be tight and renting will remain a competitive option in most markets. This year's forecast also includes price and sales predictions for the top 100 U.S. metros (see table at bottom)."", 'Overall in 2024, Realtor.com® forecasts that buyers and sellers can expect:', 'Average mortgage rates of 6.8%, with rates edging down over the year to reach 6.5% by the end of the year.', 'Home prices to ease slightly and drop by 1.7% after generally increasing since 2012.', 'Rents to drop by 0.2%, making renting a more budget-friendly option than buying in most markets.', 'A -14% year-over-year drop in inventory, as existing homeowners with low mortgage rates stay put.', 'Home sales to hold steady, rising 0.1% year over year to 4.07 million.', '""Our 2024 housing forecast reveals the green shoots we\'ve been waiting to see in the housing market and should give buyers some optimism after a grueling few years. Although mortgage rates are expected to ease throughout the course of the year, the continuation of high costs will mean that existing homeowners will continue to have a high threshold for deciding to move, but we will start to see some interest,"" said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com®. ""Moves of necessity – for job changes, family situation changes, and downsizing to a more affordable market – are likely to drive home sales in 2024. Home buyers will continue to seek out markets where they feel like they get the most out of their dollar as they look for homes that better meet their needs.""', 'Key 2023 housing trends and wildcards ', 'Affordability will officially turn around in 2024!! In 2024, the typical monthly purchase cost for the median priced home listing is expected to be slightly less than $2,200/month, or about 35% of the typical household income. That\'s an improvement from 2023, when purchase costs ate up nearly 37% of income and the typical for-sale home cost $2,240. This tick up in affordability will give a foothold to some buyers trying to break into the market. Buyers planning to get into the market this year should use Realtor.com®\'s Buying Power tool which uses results from the affordability calculator to tag homes as ""affordable,"" ""stretching,"" or ""difficult"" based on typical lending criteria.', 'Even more sellers hang back, but they could get motivated if rates drop faster than forecasted. Despite the fact that builders have been catching up, the lack of excess capacity in housing has been obvious over the last few years. With home sales activity forecasted to continue at a relatively low pace, the number of unsold homes on the market is also expected to remain low. But if rates drop faster than expected (which is possible given the roughly half point decline seen in November 2023), this could lessen rate lock sooner and bring more homes to the market than forecasted. ', 'Shiny new rental construction will hit the market. A once-hot rental market has slowed down, with the rental vacancy rate rising slightly, up to 6.6% in the third quarter of 2023, about where it was right before the pandemic. In 2024, an increase in new rentals will help push vacancy higher, closer to the 7.2% average seen from 2013-2019. While the surge in new rental options gives renters more to choose from, the sheer number of renters will minimize the potential price impact. The median asking rent in 2024 is expected to drop only slightly below its 2023 level (-0.2%).', 'Sellers should be ready to compete with new construction. Home sales will likely be driven by moves of necessity in 2024. And even with the lower inventory of existing homes, sellers will be competing with new housing. Single-family home housing starts will increase an estimated 0.4% in 2024. Sellers will need to look at the new construction market in their area to make sure pricing and marketing are competitive.', ""Geopolitics and inflation are among 2024's wildcards: Even as markets adjusted to Russia's war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East heated up to historic levels in the 4th quarter of 2023. Both wars have the potential to affect the global economy in ways that can't be fully anticipated. On the domestic front, the 2024 election season, with its attendant uncertainty, will be in full swing. And while inflation is expected to continue to subside, anything that reverses that trend could raise long-term interest rates, and in turn nudge mortgage rates higher than expected. That might discourage potential sellers from making a move and could keep potential buyers on the sidelines, putting a damper on home sales."", '""Buyers and sellers who are planning to get into the market this year should be prepared. Tools like Realtor.com®\'s RealCost™\xa0rent vs. buy and affordability calculators can help buyers ensure they are making a sound financial decision based on current interest rates and their personal financial situation.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up."", 'Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.', ' View our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions ', ""If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Shareholders will be happy to know that Motorola Solutions' EPS has grown 30% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming."", 'Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Motorola Solutions shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 22% to 25%, and revenue is growing. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.', ""The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers."", ""You don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Motorola Solutions' future profits."", ""Owing to the size of Motorola Solutions, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$169m. We note that this amounts to 0.3% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Motorola Solutions but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value."", ""You can't deny that Motorola Solutions has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value.

MSI recently augmented its mobile video portfolio with the launch of LTE-enabled V500 body-worn cameras for improved safety and security of frontline officers. With critical real-time field intelligence to emergency response backed by LTE connectivity, the cameras facilitate security personnel to respond quickly and efficiently to any adverse situation.The V500 body-worn cameras are designed to capture high-quality video from the wearer’s viewpoint with an intuitive recording function, delivering transparency with an extended battery life of up to 12 hours of operation. The device can be easily activated by the wearer without manual intervention when the equipment is unholstered.In addition to live streaming facilities for enhanced situational awareness with 128GB storage capacity, it speeds up evidentiary workflows by enabling officers to tag footage from the camera and send it to the backend software immediately. When their shift is over, the remaining footage can be offloaded quickly over a gigabit ethernet connection to free up cameras for the next shift.Motorola’s VideoManager evidence management software further helps to seamlessly upload and manage the recorded video. The body-worn cameras will enable security officers to record audio and video events with an optional pre- and post-recording capability for capturing every interaction from start to finish. It also seamlessly integrates with radio and in-car video systems, control room solutions and Holster Aware Bluetooth sensors, which can activate video recording and live-streaming if an officer draws a weapon.Riding on such state-of-the-art products, Motorola expects to record strong demand across video security and services, land mobile radio products and related software while benefiting from a solid foundation. These systems drive the demand for additional device sales and promote software upgrades and infrastructure expansion. The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks related to critical communications operations.Motorola intends to fortify its position in the public safety domain by entering into alliances with other players in the ecosystem. It remains poised to benefit from organic growth and acquisition initiatives, disciplined capital deployment and a favorable global macroeconomic environment.

Here\'s what that means to developers.  In the late 1990s, Microsoft began work on a new framework, languages, and runtime support for desktop and web development called .NET (pronounced ""dot-net""). The new languages included C# (a derivative of C), F#, and the inclusion of a new version of Microsoft\'s Visual Basic called Visual Basic.NET or simply ""VB.NET"". Microsoft announced the official release of C# at its developer conference in 2000. Soon after, Microsoft began the development and standardization through ISO and Ecma International for what it called the Common Language Infrastructure, or CLI. The idea behind CLI is to provide a common infrastructure for all of the Microsoft-developed languages. CLI is designed to provide consistent runtime behavior regardless of which language or technology was used to build a given piece of software. Microsoft\'s Common Language Runtime, or CLR, is partly based on the CLI, as are the Microsoft compilers. C# had a major advantage over its C and C++ predecessors in that C# source files are self-contained and no longer require the C/C++ header (.h) files included at the top of each source code file. C# provides other simplifications designed to reduce development time, and code size/complexity. In 2002, Microsoft also announced the ASP.NET framework - a web server and cloud-based development framework that replaced Microsoft\'s original web server framework simply called Active Server Pages (ASP).', ""In 2014 Microsoft introduced a new version of .NET called .NET Core, and later in 2020, .NET 5. More versions followed, and on November 14th, 2023 Microsoft announced the release of .NET 8 - now the current version. .NET Core is designed to allow cross-platform and web development on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems. .NET now consists of an installable runtime, an SDK, the .NET Core libraries, and on Windows, the Visual Studio IDE (Integrated Development Environment). There was a Mac version of Visual Studio previously, but it has since been canceled by Microsoft as most Apple platform development is done using Apple's own IDE, Xcode. The next version of .NET Core Version 9 is slated for a late 2024 release."", "".NET MAUI, or Multi-platform App UI was introduced with .NET 6 in 2021 and can be used to build mobile apps for iOS and Android, as well as desktop apps using C#.  MAUI uses Microsoft's open XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language), which is derived from the open-source XML web standard. XAML is based on Microsoft's Open Specification Promise, essentially a declaration that Microsoft won't litigate for third-party use of MOSP technologies. To make matters more confusing, XAML is also used in a variety of other Microsoft frameworks and technologies:"", 'WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)', 'WF (Windows Forms)', 'WinUI', 'UWP (Universal Windows Platform)', ""UWP was introduced with Windows 10 to provide a single unified technology for Windows 10, 10 Mobile, Xbox One and Series S/X, and HoloLens apps. XAML elements and attributes map to CLR properties and events. XAML can also be compiled into Microsoft's BAML (Binary Application Markup Language) files with a .BAML extension - which allows output from the above technologies to be inserted into a .NET framework assembly, and later extracted and loaded by .NET runtimes. BAML allows faster loads and execution because it effectively inserts hints or tokens into the XAML and performs pre-runtime analysis on the code using Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation."", 'An early Academic version of Visual Studio .NET from 2003.', '.NET 8 introduces several new features, but the most significant one is Microsoft\'s new cloud-ready framework and tools called Aspire, which are still in preview. Aspire is billed as a ""new cloud stack"" designed to simplify multi-cloud development and includes features such as observability and resilience. There is also an Aspire repository on Microsoft\'s main .NET GitHub page. Aspire also uses Microsoft\'s client-side web app technology called Blazor which supports developing apps in C# and HTML. Blazor also now supports the popular WebAssembly and hybrid designs. Blazor and WebAssembly speed up websites by providing single-page web apps that can be downloaded and run in the user\'s web browser, which reduces page and element load times due to network latency. Aspire also uses the Redis web caching system, as well as web components for a variety of databases, the RabbitMQ messaging system, Microsoft\'s own Azure web technologies, Open Telemetry, and PostgreSQL. Telemetry is a software feature tied to observability that allows the export of logs, metrics, and performance behavior automatically. .NET 8 also now supports NuGet packages, improved JSON serialization, memory garbage collection, .NET on Linux, WPF and diagnostics improvements, and more. All-in-all there are eighteen new features listed on Microsft\'s What\'s New in .NET page. One interesting aspect of Aspire is that Microsoft claims Aspire support can be added to existing .NET solutions (projects) assuming solutions are first upgraded fully to .NET 8. Aspire general availability is slated for sometime in the spring of 2024. Microsoft also released Visual Studio 17.8 for Windows to coincide with the .NET 8 release. A new local-only AI tool for Visual Studio called Windows AI Studio based on Azure AI Studio is set to be released in the next few weeks.', 'On the Mac, you can download and install .NET by downloading the components from Microsoft\'s website, .NET pages, or download a container image and use it to install the complete environment. There is also an ASP.NET Core download page. Microsoft also has a complete .NET GitHub page which has hundreds of git repositories for the .NET runtimes, .NET Core, asp.net Core, .NET SDKs, the .NET compilers for C# and Visual Basic (codenamed ""Roslyn""), the F# compiler, Windows Forms for building desktop apps, and documentation. The msbuild repo contains the Microsoft Build Engine which is used by the compilers, Visual Studio, and the Command-Line Interface for building projects. You can alternately use the Homebrew package manager on macOS to install .NET using Homebrew .NET formulae:', ' Note that', 'is a new formula for .NET 8 and it conflicts with the two older .NET Homebrew formulae:', '(Runtime)', '(SDK)', ""According to the Homebrew formulae documentation pages, the two older cask formulae don't support Apple Silicon Macs, but the new .NET 8 formula does. For Windows .NET 8 installs there is also a separate .NET Desktop Runtime you'll need to download to your Windows computer and install. There are separate download pages for all supported platforms. Overall .NET 8 looks promising, and if Microsoft follows through with the Aspire project, it promises to make multicloud development simpler. Also check out the dotnetconf.net virtual event online for some .NET tutorials. The site also has a YouTube channel with several introductory .NET videos.""]"

This renowned jewelry and accessories retailer has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 47.3%, on average.', 'Signet’s quarterly results are likely to have been hurt by a challenging operating landscape, including inflationary pressures, higher promotional activity and foreign currency headwinds. Also, any deleverage in SG&A expenses and stiff competition are likely to have been headwinds. The increasing macro pressures on discretionary categories, including the jewelry industry, are concerning. On its last earnings call, management had expected deleveraged fixed costs for the quarter under review on lower sales.For the fiscal third quarter, management had anticipated total sales to be in the band of $1.36-$1.41 billion and operating income to be in the range of $10-$25 million. The company had forecast a certain shift in consumer discretionary spending from the jewelry category due to decelerating consumer confidence.

In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', '-US$1.62b', '-US$1.64b', 'US$59.0m', 'US$855.0m', 'US$1.38b', 'US$1.99b', 'US$2.62b', 'US$3.22b', 'US$3.75b', 'US$4.21b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 61.90%', 'Est @ 44.00%', 'Est @ 31.46%', 'Est @ 22.69%', 'Est @ 16.55%', 'Est @ 12.25%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% ', '-US$1.5k', '-US$1.5k', 'US$49.2', 'US$672', 'US$1.0k', 'US$1.4k', 'US$1.7k', 'US$2.0k', 'US$2.2k', 'US$2.3k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.3b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%.

You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Xcel Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt.

It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued.

After months of reports about a disgruntled Goldman Sachs, it seems the companies are ready to part ways. According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, Apple sent a proposal to Goldman Sachs to exit their contract in 12 to 15 months. The exit would cover their entire partnership, including Apple Card and Apple Savings. There isn't any information about a possible new partner beyond speculation. Goldman Sachs has allegedly held discussions with American Express to take over Apple Card, and Synchrony Financial has also apparently cited interest in taking over. The report says the partnership has had issues from the start. Apple ran ads saying that Apple Card wasn't from a bank, the company insisted on customers getting their bill at the start of each month, and regulatory scrutiny occurred as a result of the partnership. It's still early days as the proposal hasn't even been approved. Apple Card and Apple Savings customers should carry on as usual until Apple makes an official announcement. There isn't any word on how this might affect Apple Card holders, rates, fees, or other operations surrounding the credit card.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Countries with the Lowest Median Age in the World.', 'While the population is aging rapidly in many of the regions globally, Africa depicts a different picture. As compared to the rest of the world, Africa’s population is relatively younger. As reported by the US Census Bureau, only 5.6% of Africa’s population was above 60 years of age in 2020 as compared to 23.4% in North America. All other regions also showed double-digit percentages in this regard. The situation has been forecasted to persist as Africa’s older population is expected to remain in single digits even by 2050. Although the share of adults in the total population across Africa is less, these adults still account for a high total. In 2020, 18 African countries had more than 1 million people aged above 60. Nigeria is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa and has a large total older population.', 'Fertility also tends to impact the age structure across countries. Many sub-Saharan African countries have high fertility levels such as Uganda which also has one of the lowest median ages in the world. Tunisia in Northern Africa has witnessed a decline in fertility and hence, the median age in the country is comparatively higher. Countries with the lowest teenage pregnancy rates have also been previously covered. ', 'Low median ages also indicate a higher dependency ratio where the working-age population is relatively younger and the older and younger populations depend on them. In 2020, Africa had the highest total dependency ratio around the world since every 100 people aged between 15 and 59 supported 82 young and older people combined. Hence, a higher support burden comes from children in Africa while more dependents belong to the older population in Europe where the median ages are higher.', 'Since high fertility rates are skewing the population towards the younger, the use of contraceptive methods can change the age structure by reducing the societal support burden for children. Hence, factors including better awareness among women, family planning programs, and wider use of contraception in Africa have been expected to bring down fertility rates.', 'In this regard, companies offering products to improve reproductive health and awareness among women include Hologic, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOLX), Femasys Inc. (NASDAQ:FEMY), and Daré Bioscience, Inc. (NASDAQ:DARE).', 'Hologic, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOLX) is a global medical technology innovator that works to improve the health and well-being of women, their families, and communities through early detection and treatment. On October 10, Hologic, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOLX)\xa0reported its partnership with the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (AAGL) and Inovus Medical. The firm will be promoting minimally invasive gynecologic surgical training through this collaboration. Since almost 77% of women tend to develop uterine fibroids during their childbearing years, Hologic, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOLX) aims to educate these obstetrician-gynecologist residents on treatment options for common gynecologic conditions.', 'Femasys Inc. (NASDAQ:FEMY) is a leading biomedical company that focuses on women’s reproductive health. The company is currently working on the first non-surgical permanent birth control method, FemBloc. This novel method is in its late-stage clinical development. On November 15, Femasys Inc. (NASDAQ:FEMY)\xa0reported a strategic upfront investment of $6.85 million by the biotech company, PharmaCyte Biotech, Inc. (NASDAQ:PMCB) and other healthcare investors. This financing will help the firm advance the pivotal clinical trial of FemBloc.', 'Daré Bioscience, Inc. (NASDAQ:DARE) is a biopharmaceutical company that focuses on areas including contraception, vaginal health, reproductive health, and sexual health. The company is working on Ovaprene as its investigational hormone-free monthly intravaginal contraceptive. On November 20, Daré Bioscience, Inc. (NASDAQ:DARE) extended its partnership with Premier Research International, LLC to support the clinical development of its reproductive health portfolio.

But if you’re looking to get involved, or just looking for some watchlist candidates, here are three names to consider.

If you want to skip our overview of the gold industry and some recent developments, then take a look at the 5 Most Undervalued Gold Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. ', ""The gold industry is one of the most interesting sectors on the stock market. This is because while most industries, save the banking sector, deal with the needs of either financial or non financial customers, gold companies sell their products for both investment and general use purposes. Gold is one of the oldest safe haven assets in the world, with its rarity and use in jewelry ascribing it a higher price than other metals such as copper. Its use as a financial assets has also made the gold industry quite important these days, particularly after the significant financial turmoil that we've seen in global equities and bond markets."", 'This turmoil has come in the wake of rapid interest rate hikes by central banks to clamp down on inflation. The interest rate increases are nothing short of historic, and they have continued to cause disruption in the bond market as securities issued during an era of lower rates have dropped in value. Since global central banks hold U.S. Treasury bonds as their assets, this rapid drop in value has seen them scurry to diversify their portfolios and ensure that the value does not significantly fluctuate.\\', ""Don't Miss: Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now"", ""Data from the World Gold Council shows that as of September 2023, central banks had bought 35 tons of gold on average per month year to date. This means that the banks have bought 315 tons this year, and leading the pack are Asian and European countries. The bulk of these purchases come from developing or emerging markets, and the top three central bank gold purchasers in September were Chinese, Polish, and Uzbekistani banks. However, among these, only China and Poland remained net purchases while Uzbekistan rebuilt some of its gold assets that it has continued to sell this year. So far, China has added roughly 200 tons to its portfolio, and with 2023 coming to an end, it'll be interesting to see how one of the biggest economies in the world closes out its gold holdings."", ""One of the key reasons why central banks buy gold is when the U.S. dollar surges in value and causes their own currencies to depreciate. In a high interest rate era, the dollar is the ultimate safe haven asset even though gold might be shinier. This is because while gold might be a store of value, it does not pay interest which naturally leads to stronger demand for the dollar. Yet, since not everyone can benefit from higher interest rates offered by U.S. Treasuries or bank accounts, the demand for gold naturally remains high when economies are slowing down. Gold now accounts for 4% of China's reserves, and data also shows that a large portion of the gold bought by the country comes from regular people who are looking to protect their wealth amidst a weak Chinese economy and a depreciating currency."", 'The tight link of gold with global financial markets also makes it a barometer of sorts for global risk appetite. While the dollar reigns supreme in a high rate environment, as soon as investors sniff rate cuts, it drops and gold starts to rise. This is also the case at the tail end of November, as gold prices have now hit a six month high to trade at $2,013.99 ahead of a crucial inflation report that is widely believed to cement the end of the era of interest rate hikes.', ""With gold prices rising and central banks piling into the metal, gold companies are also making billions. For instance, here's what the management of Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) shared during its latest earnings call:"", 'In the first nine months, we generated nearly $1.2 billion of operating cashflow, and after reinvesting in our operations and project pipeline, we generated over $400 million of free cashflow.

Paracatu also performed well in the third quarter, and as planned, had its highest production quarter of the year.

Another interesting point is that “85% of dog owners and 76% of cat owners consider their pets to be a member of the family.” A key conclusion from this statistic is that households are investing equally in food and healthcare for their pets. It’s therefore not surprising that pet care stocks have been value creators.', 'Another important point to note is that the above data is just for one country. If we look at global data, the market size will be significant. To put things into perspective, the global pet care market is likely to be worth $246.66 billion this year.

To skip the detailed analysis of widow and orphan stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy.', 'Widow and orphan stocks are well-established blue-chip companies that pay out stable dividends, have low volatility, and grow steadily over time. These companies are most suitable for vulnerable investors with a low knowledge of the stock market, like retirees, widows, and orphans. The term was coined in the 1930s for stocks that are mature enough to weather economic turbulence. Widow and orphan stocks is an outdated term for low-volatility investments.', 'One of the most attractive features of widow and orphan stocks is that these companies have the ability to maintain their dividend payments during tough times. For example, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been increasing its dividend for the past 67 years, which means that the company was able to sustain itself through several recessions, including the Black Monday of 1987, The Great Financial Crisis, and the COVID-19 recessions along with the aftermath of Russia-Ukraine war.', 'While widow and orphan stocks might be considered safe investments, they still have their drawbacks. These companies have stable growth, but in a bull market, these stocks cannot take advantage of favorable market conditions like growth stocks due to their low volatility. This might not apply to a few companies on our list, such as Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), as these companies have recorded major profits and losses in the last few decades. However, these oil Supermajors have still maintained their dividends for decades despite heavy losses suffered in 2016 and 2020 as they are fundamentally strong.', 'The stock market has performed better than expected in 2023 as the S&P 500 is up over 19%, and the NASDAQ-100 is up 47.5% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of writing on November 28. Despite the strong performance due to the boom in the technology sector, some analysts still believe that a recession could hit the US economy in 2024. If we consider their prediction, investing in safe and stable companies like the widow and orphan stocks can safeguard investments. Widow and orphan stocks are also perfect investments for beginners with little knowledge of the stock market.', 'Some of the best widow and orphan stocks include Walmart Inc.

High-yield dividend stocks offer a reliable stream of income, making them attractive for investors seeking regular cash flow. Additionally, high dividend yields can indicate financial strength and stability in a company, as firms typically need consistent earnings to sustain such payouts. Historical analysis also shows that high-dividend stocks have shown stronger performance than the overall market. According to a report by Newton Investment Management, over the span of 1940 to 2021, stocks exhibiting high dividend yields often showcased a trend of outperforming the broader market during periods characterized by high inflation.', ""This year, dividend stocks have taken a back seat as technology stocks, driven by the expanding realm of artificial intelligence, have captured investors' focus. Bloomberg Intelligence notes a relatively low influx of just $786 million into dividend ETFs, marking the smallest flow since 2006. Despite this, analysts hold an optimistic view of dividend growth stocks. These stocks typically offer investors a consistent and increasing stream of income over time. The appeal lies in their ability to provide shareholders with a reliable source of growing dividends, making them an attractive option despite the recent surge in interest toward tech-related investments."", 'Kirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, advises investors to consider both price gains and dividend income for their overall return. Dividend-paying stocks hold additional benefits as their regular income can offset losses during market dips, providing balance in a portfolio.

This approach aligns with a more growth-oriented strategy, allowing investors to benefit from companies that demonstrate a track record of boosting dividends over time. Verizon Communications Inc.

These risks and uncertainties could require NEP to limit or eliminate certain operations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: NEP\'s ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders is affected by the performance of its renewable energy projects which could be impacted by wind and solar conditions and in certain circumstances by market prices; operation and maintenance of renewable energy projects and pipelines involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages, reduced output or capacity, personal injury or loss of life; NEP\'s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather; NEP depends on certain of the renewable energy projects and pipelines in its portfolio for a substantial portion of its anticipated cash flows; NEP may pursue the repowering of renewable energy projects or the expansion of natural gas pipelines that would require up-front capital expenditures and could expose NEP to project development risks; geopolitical factors, terrorist acts, cyberattacks or other similar events could impact NEP\'s projects, pipelines or surrounding areas and adversely affect its business; the ability of NEP to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NEP\'s insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses; NEP relies on interconnection, transmission and other pipeline facilities of third parties to deliver energy from its renewable energy projects and to transport natural gas to and from its pipelines. If these facilities become unavailable, NEP\'s projects and pipelines may not be able to operate or deliver energy or may become partially or fully unavailable to transport natural gas; NEP\'s business is subject to liabilities and operating restrictions arising from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase NEP\'s cost of operations and affect or limit its business plans; NEP\'s renewable energy projects or pipelines may be adversely affected by legislative changes or a failure to comply with applicable energy and pipeline regulations; Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) may claim certain immunities under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Mexican law, and the subsidiaries\' of NEP that directly own the natural gas pipeline assets located in Texas ability to sue or recover from Pemex for breach of contract may be limited and may be exacerbated if there is a deterioration in the economic relationship between the U.S. and Mexico; NEP does not own all of the land on which the projects in its portfolio are located and its use and enjoyment of the property may be adversely affected to the extent that there are any lienholders or land rights holders that have rights that are superior to NEP\'s rights or the U.S. Bureau of Land Management suspends its federal rights-of-way grants; NEP is subject to risks associated with litigation or administrative proceedings that could materially impact its operations, including, but not limited to, proceedings related to projects it acquires in the future; NEP\'s operations require NEP to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and Mexico; NEP is subject to risks associated with its ownership interests in projects that are under construction, which could result in its inability to complete construction projects on time or at all, and make projects too expensive to complete or cause the return on an investment to be less than expected; NEP relies on a limited number of customers and is exposed to the risk that they may be unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to NEP or that they otherwise terminate their agreements with NEP; NEP may not be able to extend, renew or replace expiring or terminated power purchase agreements (PPA), natural gas transportation agreements or other customer contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis; if the energy production by or availability of NEP\'s renewable energy projects is less than expected, they may not be able to satisfy minimum production or availability obligations under their PPAs; NEP\'s growth strategy depends on locating and acquiring interests in additional projects consistent with its business strategy at favorable prices; reductions in demand for natural gas in the U.S. or Mexico and low market prices of natural gas could materially adversely affect NEP\'s pipeline operations and cash flows; government laws, regulations and policies providing incentives and subsidies for clean energy could be changed, reduced or eliminated at any time and such changes may negatively impact NEP\'s growth strategy; NEP\'s growth strategy depends on the acquisition of projects developed by NextEra Energy, Inc.

These agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting, and the gains or losses on an interest rate swap are reported in other income and expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operation and other comprehensive income.Beginning this quarter and for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we present a non-GAAP adjustment to reclassify the mark-to-market adjustment on the interest rate swap from other income (expense) to net sales to align the swap impact with the impact on customer financing net sales. We believe adjusted net sales, adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income, which include the gains and losses on the interest rate swap, provides additional comparability from period to period because they present the impact of interest rate fluctuations, net of the mark-to-market swap adjustment, within adjusted net sales. We note the net impact of interest rate fluctuations has a minimal impact on net income. Deal amortization along with the related tax effect of this item. We believe this adjustment provides comparability with other companies.', 'The term ""free cash flow"" used in this release is defined as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures plus the collection of deferred purchase price receivables.', 'In addition, the term ""internal sales"" used in this release represents net sales adjusted for the effects of currency translation, contributions from recent acquisitions and the net impact of an interest rate swap. Foreign currency impact represents the difference in results that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the company uses to convert results for all foreign entities where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. The company calculates the impact as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period’s currency exchange rates. The company believes the disclosure of net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency, an interest rate swap and recent acquisitions provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of fluctuations in these variables that are independent of our period-over-period performance.', 'Management believes that these non-GAAP measures may provide a helpful representation of the company’s performance and enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance.

The 10-City Composite showed an increase of 4.8%, up from a 3.0% increase in the previous month. The 20-City Composite posted a year-over-year increase of 3.9%, up from a 2.1% increase in the previous month. Detroit surpassed Chicago, reporting the highest year-over-year gain among the 20 cities with an 6.7% increase in September, followed by San Diego with a 6.5% increase.

Year-over-year, September\'s worst performers were Las Vegas (-1.9%), Phoenix (-1.2%), and Portland (-0.7%). The Northeast (+5.3%) and Midwest (+5.0%) continue as the nation\'s strongest regions, while the West (-1.3%) remains the weakest.', '""On a year-to-date basis, the National Composite has risen 6.1%, which is well above the median full calendar year increase in more than 35 years of data.

If you want to skip our overview of the gold industry and some recent developments, then take a look at the 5 Most Undervalued Gold Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. ', ""The gold industry is one of the most interesting sectors on the stock market. This is because while most industries, save the banking sector, deal with the needs of either financial or non financial customers, gold companies sell their products for both investment and general use purposes. Gold is one of the oldest safe haven assets in the world, with its rarity and use in jewelry ascribing it a higher price than other metals such as copper. Its use as a financial assets has also made the gold industry quite important these days, particularly after the significant financial turmoil that we've seen in global equities and bond markets."", 'This turmoil has come in the wake of rapid interest rate hikes by central banks to clamp down on inflation. The interest rate increases are nothing short of historic, and they have continued to cause disruption in the bond market as securities issued during an era of lower rates have dropped in value. Since global central banks hold U.S. Treasury bonds as their assets, this rapid drop in value has seen them scurry to diversify their portfolios and ensure that the value does not significantly fluctuate.\\', ""Don't Miss: Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now"", ""Data from the World Gold Council shows that as of September 2023, central banks had bought 35 tons of gold on average per month year to date. This means that the banks have bought 315 tons this year, and leading the pack are Asian and European countries. The bulk of these purchases come from developing or emerging markets, and the top three central bank gold purchasers in September were Chinese, Polish, and Uzbekistani banks. However, among these, only China and Poland remained net purchases while Uzbekistan rebuilt some of its gold assets that it has continued to sell this year. So far, China has added roughly 200 tons to its portfolio, and with 2023 coming to an end, it'll be interesting to see how one of the biggest economies in the world closes out its gold holdings."", ""One of the key reasons why central banks buy gold is when the U.S. dollar surges in value and causes their own currencies to depreciate. In a high interest rate era, the dollar is the ultimate safe haven asset even though gold might be shinier. This is because while gold might be a store of value, it does not pay interest which naturally leads to stronger demand for the dollar. Yet, since not everyone can benefit from higher interest rates offered by U.S. Treasuries or bank accounts, the demand for gold naturally remains high when economies are slowing down. Gold now accounts for 4% of China's reserves, and data also shows that a large portion of the gold bought by the country comes from regular people who are looking to protect their wealth amidst a weak Chinese economy and a depreciating currency."", 'The tight link of gold with global financial markets also makes it a barometer of sorts for global risk appetite. While the dollar reigns supreme in a high rate environment, as soon as investors sniff rate cuts, it drops and gold starts to rise. This is also the case at the tail end of November, as gold prices have now hit a six month high to trade at $2,013.99 ahead of a crucial inflation report that is widely believed to cement the end of the era of interest rate hikes.', ""With gold prices rising and central banks piling into the metal, gold companies are also making billions. For instance, here's what the management of Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) shared during its latest earnings call:"", 'In the first nine months, we generated nearly $1.2 billion of operating cashflow, and after reinvesting in our operations and project pipeline, we generated over $400 million of free cashflow.

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Should You Invest in PHM?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for PulteGroup, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $11.49.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PulteGroup.

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky."", ""Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together."", ' See our latest analysis for Merck ', 'You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of September 2023 Merck had US$34.9b of debt, an increase on US$30.4b, over one year. However, it also had US$8.77b in cash, and so its net debt is US$26.1b.', 'The latest balance sheet data shows that Merck had liabilities of US$23.1b due within a year, and liabilities of US$42.3b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$8.77b in cash and US$11.7b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$45.0b.', 'Of course, Merck has a titanic market capitalization of US$257.0b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.', ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses."", ""Merck's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2.0 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its strong interest cover of 17.6 times, makes us even more comfortable. Shareholders should be aware that Merck's EBIT was down 48% last year. If that earnings trend continues then paying off its debt will be about as easy as herding cats on to a roller coaster. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Merck can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the last three years, Merck recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 90% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt."", ""Merck's EBIT growth rate was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered were considerably better. In particular, we are dazzled with its interest cover. Considering this range of data points, we think Merck is in a good position to manage its debt levels. Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.   We've identified 5 warning signs  with Merck , and understanding them should be part of your investment process."", ""At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

For instance, one of the most well known industrial companies in the world is the American manufacturing giant General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). General Electric was set up in 1892 and it is responsible for making some of the most advanced technological products in the world. Two of General Electric's most important business divisions are the aerospace and energy businesses. The GE Aerospace business division is one of the few jet engine manufacturers in the world. Its products are used by big ticket firms such as The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and often prove to be indispensable when it comes to alternatives. Similarly, the GE Power division is one of the handful of power turbine companies in the world, and one that is also capable of manufacturing products for nuclear power plants."", ""Another big ticket industrial name is Boeing. Boeing is the only company apart from Airbus that makes commercial jets in the Western world, with some of its biggest products capable of flying hundreds of people all over the world. Additionally, Boeing is also one of the world's leading technology companies when it comes to aerospace and astronautics. Its aircraft such as the F-15EX fighter planes are among the most advanced in the world and are used by the world's leading military powers such as the U.S. Air Force. Similarly, Boeing is NASA's primary manufacturing partner for the space agency's Artemis program."", ""NASA Artemis plans to place humans on the Moon once again after the Apollo program, and the Boeing built Space Launch System (SLS) rocket successfully sent the Orion spacecraft to a lunar orbit last year as part of NASA's first Artemis test flight. The SLS is also the world's most powerful operational rocket, and it uses solid rocket boosters manufactured by the industrial company Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) and engines made by the L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) subsidiary Aerojet Rocketdyne."", ""Nuclear power, jet engines, and rockets are the leading demonstrators of humanity's 2023 technological advancements over people living just a century back. The fact that the industrial segment is responsible for making all these products ensures that this segment is indispensable to our progress. At the same time, the sector is also relatively insulated against competition. After all, Aerojet and SpaceX are the only two operational rocket engine manufacturers in America, Boeing and Airbus SE (EPA:AIR.PA) are the only ones making passenger planes in the Western world, and Northrop, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) are the only ones that provide fighter aircraft to the Pentagon."", ""This is simply due to the high capital expenditure involved in setting up these companies, and the technologically complex products mean that new entrants often spend decades before a final product is ready. One of the most recent examples of this phenomenon in the industrial segment is Jeff Bezos's rocket company Blue Origin, whose BE engine lineup has been developed for years and should make its first flight in December 2023."", ""So, if you're wondering about what undervalued industrial stocks might be ripe for entry and are being bought by hedge funds, you're in the right place.

We might be witnessing Boeing’s long-term turnaround in 2023’s final months, and I am bullish on BA stock in light of a Wall Street expert’s upgrade.', 'Boeing is an American aerospace and defense giant, and BA stock was once considered a safe defensive investment. For much of this year, however, the market focused on the “Magnificent Seven” technology stocks and left Boeing behind.', 'Yet, as we’ll see, analysts are mostly bullish on Boeing stock, and at least one of them expects the share price to make a sizable move over the next 12 months. There are no guarantees, of course, but I believe taking a moderately-sized share position in Boeing looks like a smart move now.', 'Even if Boeing isn’t a member of the “Magnificent Seven,” there’s been a slew of magnificent news items about Boeing in the past few weeks. If one of them doesn’t convince you to consider BA stock, maybe some of the other positive developments will change your mind.', 'First of all, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted Boeing “type inspection authorization,” allowing the company to commence flight testing its 737 Max 10 jet. This step could be instrumental as Boeing seeks to achieve certification for this potential addition to the company’s popular Max jet lineup.', 'Second, according to TheFly, Air Lease (NYSE:AL) announced that Boeing has delivered the first of a 25-unit order of 737-8 aircraft to Malaysia Airlines Berhad. Furthermore, Thai Airways is considering a “potential order for as many as 90 mostly widebody aircraft” from Airbus (OTC:EADSY) and Boeing. This would be “part of a long-term fleet renewal,” sources indicate.', 'On top of all that, Boeing scored an order for six 737 Max-8 planes from Virgin Australia. Deliveries are anticipated in the second half of 2024. With that, Virgin Australia has ordered a total of 14,737 Max-8 units.', 'That’s a lot for prospective investors to think about. With all of this good news coming in, don’t be too surprised if Boeing delivers a positive surprise or two in its next earnings report, which is slated for January 2024.', 'Boeing stock tanked from August through October, but it appears that there’s a comeback in progress. However, with the share price hovering above $220, could an extended run to $275 be in the cards?', 'At least one prominent analyst seems to believe so. Not only did RBC Capital analyst\xa0Kenneth Herbert\xa0upgrade BA stock from a Hold to a Buy, but he also raised his price target on the shares from $200 all the way up to $275.', 'Evidently, Herbert envisions brighter days ahead in the wake of a challenging year for Boeing. “After another year of supply-chain disruptions and lowered expectations, we believe the set-up into 2024 is favorable,” the RBC Capital analyst opined.', 'I already mentioned some of Boeing’s current and potential orders, which indicate consistent demand for the company’s aircraft. On that topic, Herbert commented that he expects “the strong demand to sustain for both the commercial and defense business.”', 'If Herbert is correct, this strong demand should translate to improved free cash flow for Boeing in the long term. Thus, the analyst anticipates that Boeing will deliver free cash flow of $3.5 billion in 2023, $5.5 billion in 2024, and $8.5 billion and 2025.', 'On TipRanks, BA comes in as a Strong Buy based on\xa015 Buys and three Hold ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Boeing stock price target is $249.67, implying 12.3% upside potential.', 'If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell BA stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\xa0Myles Walton of Wolfe Research, with an average return of 16.2% per rating and a 60% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.', 'It’s fine to hold some “Magnificent Seven” stocks in your portfolio, but don’t ignore recovery stories like Boeing. Herbert’s remarks suggest that Boeing could deliver magnificent returns to its shareholders during the next 12 months.', 'Besides, there’s enough good news to persuade sensible investors that Boeing\xa0is on the right track. Therefore, I would definitely consider BA stock for a buy-and-hold position.', 'Disclosure']"

High-yield dividend stocks offer a reliable stream of income, making them attractive for investors seeking regular cash flow. Additionally, high dividend yields can indicate financial strength and stability in a company, as firms typically need consistent earnings to sustain such payouts. Historical analysis also shows that high-dividend stocks have shown stronger performance than the overall market. According to a report by Newton Investment Management, over the span of 1940 to 2021, stocks exhibiting high dividend yields often showcased a trend of outperforming the broader market during periods characterized by high inflation.', ""This year, dividend stocks have taken a back seat as technology stocks, driven by the expanding realm of artificial intelligence, have captured investors' focus. Bloomberg Intelligence notes a relatively low influx of just $786 million into dividend ETFs, marking the smallest flow since 2006.

The appeal lies in their ability to provide shareholders with a reliable source of growing dividends, making them an attractive option despite the recent surge in interest toward tech-related investments."", 'Kirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, advises investors to consider both price gains and dividend income for their overall return. Dividend-paying stocks hold additional benefits as their regular income can offset losses during market dips, providing balance in a portfolio. Moreover, in times of low interest rates, these stocks might offer higher income compared to Treasury bonds, CDs, or corporate bonds. Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“Companies that have consistently increased their dividends tend to be more stable, higher quality businesses, which historically have weathered downturns and are more likely to have the ability to pay dividends consistently.”', 'Cabacungan suggests that if your aim is to generate consistent income, focusing on stocks with higher-than-average dividend yields over an extended period could be beneficial. However, for investors seeking growth without an immediate need for income, she recommends considering stocks known for consistently increasing dividends as their cash flows and profits grow. This approach aligns with a more growth-oriented strategy, allowing investors to benefit from companies that demonstrate a track record of boosting dividends over time. Verizon Communications Inc.

But what about how they shopped? It was a lot more on mobile this year. Tell us about those numbers and how they could potentially really open up people to more scams as well."", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: Right, Rachelle. Well, certainly, mobile spending continues to be increasing the amount of people who use it. It's more convenient. They don't have to go to stores. And what we're seeing is a pullback in in-store foot traffic."", 'According to RetailNext, we saw foot traffic in-stores on actual Black Friday up just 2% compared to last year. But across the five-day period, smartphones used during online sales shopping was 51.8%.', ""So consumers certainly showing up and using their smartphones in order pay off. And so all those companies that really invested heavily in their retail apps during the past two years, think Walmart, think Target, even others like Sephora, that's certainly paying off this past Cyber Weekend."", ""We also noted-- you know, it's important to note rather that we do-- this does mean that consumers are more vulnerable to scams. And so it's really important that consumers double-check those domain names, look out for any grammatical errors."", ""And with the increase in AI, those scams are becoming a lot more legitimate-looking. And so it's important to keep a close eye out that before clicking on any text, any links, any emails, social media ads, look out to make sure that there's that lock symbol on the URL to make sure it's secure."", 'AKIKO FUJITA: OK, certainly an important reminder there. Brooke DiPalma, thanks so much for breaking that down for us today.']"

Here's how to use it.  At the dawn of the personal computer era in the early 1980's IBM developed what is now called the PC standard with the IBM PC model 5150. Development took place at IBM's R+D facility in Boca Raton, Florida. IBM had seen the success of Apple's first hit product, the Apple II, in 1978 and decided it wanted to dominate the PC market. IBM's decision to open-source the PC hardware standard to other manufacturers allowed it to beat Apple at its own game since the Apple II standard remained closed. Cheap clone PCs soon followed, and eventually, they became a commodity for business everywhere. The video game industry was booming in the late '70s and early '80s with Atari and Commodore consoles and computers dominating the market. Then came the video game crash of 1983 which threw the industry into recession and turmoil. It wouldn't recover until Nintendo's introduction of the Nintendo 64, and later with the introduction of the Sony Playstation in 1995."", 'IBM PC model 5150. Note the two 5.25-inch floppy disk drives on the right.', ""IBM had one small problem: it wasn't good at making PC software, and it needed an operating system (OS) for its new PC. A then-very-young Bill Gates along with Paul Allen had just started Microsoft, mainly building compilers and add-in hardware cards for Apple II computers. Microsoft also licensed its version of a BASIC programming compiler to most personal computer makers of the day. Gates got wind of the IBM PC project and that it needed an OS. Microsoft not yet having a PC OS itself, Gates shrewdly bought the rights and source code to an OS called Quick and Dirty Operating System (QDOS) written by Tim Paterson at Seattle Computer Products. According to most historical sources, and not knowing Gates intended to license the OS to IBM, on July 27th, 1981 SCP signed a deal with Microsoft to hand over the exclusive rights and source code for a mere $50,000. Within a month, Microsoft had modified QDOS, which had been renamed to 86-DOS and had it running on the PC - further renaming it simply to DOS, and licensed it to IBM for use with the new computer. The rest is history. Due to the DOS licensing deal, Microsoft, Gates, and Allen became fabulously wealthy - making billions off the royalties and licensing of DOS to IBM. DOS was simple and easy to use with a text-only interface and keyboard-based app control, and it was based on an earlier OS called CP/M created by Digital Research in 1974. Later, when mice became standard on most computers, mouse support was added to DOS. Later, Microsoft sold full retail versions of DOS shipped on floppy disks for users to install manually (this was before the internet was ubiquitous). The retail version of Microsoft DOS came to be known simply as MS-DOS."", 'MS-DOS retail packaging design. Microsoft eventually stopped supporting DOS officially - in 2001. In 2022 Microsoft officially made the early MS-DOS source code open source, which is now readily available online. There\'s an official Microsoft MS-DOS 1.25 and 2.0 GitHub repository page available. The PC project at IBM initially encountered resistance - with several executives and managers calling the project ""crazy"" and against the project claiming the Apple II was a fluke - and that mainframes and minicomputers were still the future.', 'PC users began to run DOS for a variety of business tasks such as accounting, spreadsheets, and word processing. But younger users also wanted games, as the Apple II had, and a host of new DOS games appeared that ran on the PC with limited, but effective CGA, and later, VGA graphics. Games had already proliferated on the Apple II and soon most of them were ported to DOS on the PC. A mass development of PC games ensued, and soon there were hundreds of titles for PC users to choose from.', ""Today you can still run MS-DOS in emulation on the Mac and most other modern PCs in virtualization software such as Virtual Box and VMWare - and you can run most DOS games along with it. But if you don't have time to set up emulator software and get DOS installed, there's an even simpler way to play DOS games on modern computers: online game portals. Several classic vintage online game sites have appeared, many of which allow you to play classic games right in your web browser. Some of the sites even let you run old versions of DOS in your browser. One such DOS game portal site is DOS_deck by Martin Kool. DOS_deck allows you to run a dozen or so classic DOS games on your Mac or PC without a stand-alone emulator. As the DOS_deck website states, its emulator is based on two previous great DOS emulators for personal computers: DOSBox and JS-DOS. DOSBox is still around and you can download the app to run on your Mac, PC, or Linux computer. DOSBox looks and acts just like the original MS-DOS running in an app window. Keep in mind although DOSBox works and is near feature-complete, it is still pre-release software and continues to be in development."", ""DOSBox running on the Mac. JS-DOS is a JavaScript implementation of MS-DOS that runs in most standard web browsers and is still available online at js-dos.com, although that site states it is obsolete and to navigate to dos.zone.com instead. As the DOS_deck site also states, most original games for MS-DOS were keyboard-controlled. One of DOS_deck's big features is that its DOS games have been modified to work with modern game controllers. If you want to play the DOS_deck games on an iPad or iPhone, you'll need an Apple-compatible Bluetooth game controller. The games do supply a virtual keyboard, but support for it on iOS devices varies, and in some cases is incomplete, depending on the game. See the DOS_deck About page for more details."", 'As also stated on the DOS_deck About page, all the games provided on the site are legal - either shareware, free, demos, or games that were once commercially sold, but which are now either free or abandoned (""liberated"") by their publishers. With a little modification, you can also get DOS_deck to run on the Steam Deck handheld console. Currently, as of this writing, there are fourteen games in the DOS_deck collection, including the original DOOM, Wolfenstein 3D, Command and Conquer, Heretic, WarCraft from Activision Blizzard, and others. To play any one of the games in a web browser, go to the site\'s home page and click one of the game icons. You\'ll be taken to a preview screen with a Play button. Hit Play to launch the game. You can enter fullscreen in any of the games by clicking the full-screen icon in your browser window to make the window fullscreen. Hit Esc or ""="" on your Mac keyboard to exit full screen. DOS_deck\'s servers are very responsive and most of the games load in under a few seconds. Game performance is great.', 'The DOS_deck web interface. Several of the games have links to other online gaming sites such as Steam and Galaxy of Games (GOG) where you can purchase them online, download them, and add them to your game collection. Both Steam and GOG have Mac and Windows client store apps you can download to manage game purchases. DOS_deck is a quick and easy way to play classic retro DOS games. Kool has mentioned more vintage DOS games will be added to the website as time allows.', ""Today there are dozens of classic DOS sites and DOS emulator apps for the Mac and Windows. You can download any one of these, run it, and load your vintage DOS games and apps into it. DOSBox is but one of these. Others include 86Box, MAME, QEMU, and others. There are even DOS emulators for modern game consoles such as Xbox X/S, Steam Deck, and Nintendo Switch. Far and away the easiest way to run DOS games on modern gaming hardware is to install the RetroArch multi-system emulator. It has the ability to run dozens of different operating systems and classic hardware emulators. RetroArch is available on most platforms but you can also download and install it from Steam. Another fabulous DOS emulator site is PCjs Machines by Jeff Parsons. PCjs Machines allows you to boot an amazing variety of vintage operating systems and games including DOS and many variants thereof. The site is easy to use and is organized by hardware and OS platforms. Large thumbnails next to each title show you exactly what you'll get when you run them. One of the best resources for vintage DOS videos and tutorials is PhilsComputerLab on YouTube. Phil lives in Australia and has hundreds of DOS-related videos spanning several years: everything from building retro PC DOS computers, to sound and graphics cards, drivers and utilities, and gaming videos. Phil also has a website which has software drivers, utilities, patches and other software to get classic DOS games running on modern hardware and operating systems - a goldmine of valuable DOS gaming info.""]"

In his current role at Marathon Petroleum Corp.

""It is definitely one of the most fulfilling things in my life.""', 'Leybas stays busy in his role as a leader with MPLX G&P, supporting tribal communities with the TAWG, family activities, and making time for his favorite sport of fishing. His experiences have taught him to work hard and play hard.', 'Life in Oklahoma', '""I\'m definitely my mama\'s boy,"" said Leybas. ""I\'ll be 50 in December, and she never fails to tell me how proud she is of me. I\'ve been blessed, even through adversity.""', ""Leybas grew up and went to school in Oklahoma. He's a proud graduate of Southeastern Oklahoma State University, where he earned a Bachelor of Accounting degree and then his master's in business administration (MBA) in Finance in 2019."", 'Leybas met his wife Crystal in college, and they have been married for 23 years and have two children. His daughter, Kaylee, is 21 years old and a senior at Oklahoma State University (OSU); his son, Cole, is 16 years old and a sophomore in high school. Leybas says they have a pretty nice little family that stays active and loves spending time together.', 'Leybas has worked for MPC for almost 15 years.

That was mentally hard.""', ""But he had lots of support from family and friends that helped him persevere. His doctors said he was still strong and young, and there were options.

He goes for scans every 90 days, and he's happy to be back to doing all the things he loves."", 'All-American Fisherman', ""One of Leybas' favorite hobbies is competitive bass fishing, and he's made quite a name for himself in the sport."", '""Fishing is therapeutic. I\'ve been doing it for 30 years,"" said Leybas.', 'In 2022, he qualified to fish in the Major League Fishing Phoenix Bass Fishing League All-American tournament at Lake Cartwell in South Carolina.

If you want to skip our overview of the industrial sector and some recent developments, then take a look at 5 Most Undervalued Industrial Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. ', ""If there's one thing that can be said with certainty, it's that the industrial segment is responsible for today's technological and civilizational advances. Whether it's mass produced consumer products such as toothpaste and deodorants, or airplanes and cars, industrial mass production has rapidly transformed humanity's standard of living in just a couple of decades."", ""In the 21st century, even though most investor and media attention is focused on lucrative technology companies, industrial firms remain at the center of global prosperity and advancements. For instance, one of the most well known industrial companies in the world is the American manufacturing giant General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). General Electric was set up in 1892 and it is responsible for making some of the most advanced technological products in the world. Two of General Electric's most important business divisions are the aerospace and energy businesses. The GE Aerospace business division is one of the few jet engine manufacturers in the world. Its products are used by big ticket firms such as The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and often prove to be indispensable when it comes to alternatives. Similarly, the GE Power division is one of the handful of power turbine companies in the world, and one that is also capable of manufacturing products for nuclear power plants."", ""Another big ticket industrial name is Boeing. Boeing is the only company apart from Airbus that makes commercial jets in the Western world, with some of its biggest products capable of flying hundreds of people all over the world. Additionally, Boeing is also one of the world's leading technology companies when it comes to aerospace and astronautics. Its aircraft such as the F-15EX fighter planes are among the most advanced in the world and are used by the world's leading military powers such as the U.S. Air Force. Similarly, Boeing is NASA's primary manufacturing partner for the space agency's Artemis program."", ""NASA Artemis plans to place humans on the Moon once again after the Apollo program, and the Boeing built Space Launch System (SLS) rocket successfully sent the Orion spacecraft to a lunar orbit last year as part of NASA's first Artemis test flight. The SLS is also the world's most powerful operational rocket, and it uses solid rocket boosters manufactured by the industrial company Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) and engines made by the L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) subsidiary Aerojet Rocketdyne."", ""Nuclear power, jet engines, and rockets are the leading demonstrators of humanity's 2023 technological advancements over people living just a century back. The fact that the industrial segment is responsible for making all these products ensures that this segment is indispensable to our progress. At the same time, the sector is also relatively insulated against competition. After all, Aerojet and SpaceX are the only two operational rocket engine manufacturers in America, Boeing and Airbus SE (EPA:AIR.PA) are the only ones making passenger planes in the Western world, and Northrop, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) are the only ones that provide fighter aircraft to the Pentagon."", ""This is simply due to the high capital expenditure involved in setting up these companies, and the technologically complex products mean that new entrants often spend decades before a final product is ready. One of the most recent examples of this phenomenon in the industrial segment is Jeff Bezos's rocket company Blue Origin, whose BE engine lineup has been developed for years and should make its first flight in December 2023."", ""So, if you're wondering about what undervalued industrial stocks might be ripe for entry and are being bought by hedge funds, you're in the right place.

To skip the detailed analysis of widow and orphan stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy.', 'Widow and orphan stocks are well-established blue-chip companies that pay out stable dividends, have low volatility, and grow steadily over time. These companies are most suitable for vulnerable investors with a low knowledge of the stock market, like retirees, widows, and orphans. The term was coined in the 1930s for stocks that are mature enough to weather economic turbulence. Widow and orphan stocks is an outdated term for low-volatility investments.', 'One of the most attractive features of widow and orphan stocks is that these companies have the ability to maintain their dividend payments during tough times. For example, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been increasing its dividend for the past 67 years, which means that the company was able to sustain itself through several recessions, including the Black Monday of 1987, The Great Financial Crisis, and the COVID-19 recessions along with the aftermath of Russia-Ukraine war.', 'While widow and orphan stocks might be considered safe investments, they still have their drawbacks. These companies have stable growth, but in a bull market, these stocks cannot take advantage of favorable market conditions like growth stocks due to their low volatility. This might not apply to a few companies on our list, such as Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), as these companies have recorded major profits and losses in the last few decades. However, these oil Supermajors have still maintained their dividends for decades despite heavy losses suffered in 2016 and 2020 as they are fundamentally strong.', 'The stock market has performed better than expected in 2023 as the S&P 500 is up over 19%, and the NASDAQ-100 is up 47.5% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of writing on November 28. Despite the strong performance due to the boom in the technology sector, some analysts still believe that a recession could hit the US economy in 2024. If we consider their prediction, investing in safe and stable companies like the widow and orphan stocks can safeguard investments. Widow and orphan stocks are also perfect investments for beginners with little knowledge of the stock market.', 'Some of the best widow and orphan stocks include Walmart Inc.

The world's largest cruise line hosted a ceremony on the first-of-its-kind combination of the best of every vacation, where representatives signed on the dotted line just two months before the new ship's January 2024 debut in Miami."", 'Marking the milestone at the celebration were more than 1,200 crew members and workers, who were joined by Royal Caribbean Group President and CEO Jason Liberty, Royal Caribbean International President and CEO Michael\xa0Bayley and Meyer Turku CEO Tim Meyer.', '""Today, we are celebrating more than a new ship; it\'s also the celebration of the culmination of more than 50 years of innovation and dreaming at Royal Caribbean to create the ultimate vacation experience,"" said Jason Liberty, president and CEO, Royal Caribbean Group. ""Delivering Icon of the Seas represents all that can be accomplished with strong partnerships and a commitment to delivering memorable vacations responsibly, and we thank Meyer Turku and an incredible village of skilled partners for joining us on this journey. The memories millions of families and vacationers will make on Icon will be our greatest accomplishment yet.""', ""The transfer of ownership, commonly known as the delivery of a new ship, between Royal Caribbean and Meyer Turku also commemorated the series of never-before-seen feats accomplished during more than two years of construction: from the installation of the AquaDome, the single largest glass and steel structure to be lifted onto a cruise ship, to engineering more water on board\xa0than ever before across seven pools, six record-breaking waterslides and more. Now is when Icon will sail from Turku to Cadiz, Spain, where the cruise line will start to put the finishing touches on the world's best vacation before it heads to Miami. Starting Wednesday, Nov. 29, adventurers can follow Icon's journey by visiting Royal Caribbean's website."", '""Welcoming Icon of the Seas to the Royal Caribbean family is a remarkable accomplishment years in the making for thousands of innovators, engineers, architects and designers,"" said Michael Bayley, president and CEO, Royal Caribbean International.

And with\xa028 different ways to stay, including the new three-level Ultimate Family Townhouse, even the rooms are thoughtfully designed for every type of vacationer.', 'The\xa0five brand-new neighborhoods\xa0and\xa0three reimagined favorites are destinations in themselves filled with a variety of experiences, live entertainment, restaurants and bars, including:', ""Thrill Island – The new center of thrill features Category 6, the largest waterpark at sea, with six record-breaking slides; Crown's Edge, part skywalk, part ropes course and part thrill ride on which adventurers swing 154 feet above the ocean; the FlowRider simulator; the Lost Dunes minigolf course and more. In between adrenaline rushes, just steps away are new spots to grab laidback bites or sweet treats: Basecamp and Desserted for over-the-top milkshakes."", ""Chill Island – Four of the seven pools on Icon are at this three-deck slice of paradise, each with a unique vibe and prime ocean views: the lively Swim & Tonic, the cruise line's first swimup bar at sea; Royal Bay, the largest pool at sea; Cloud 17, an adults-only retreat; and the serene, infinity-edge Cove Pool. With different tunes from live bands and DJs, and poolside spots for drinks and quick, casual food – like The Lime & Coconut and its new frozen cocktail bar, and El Loco Fresh & Cantina Fresca – vacationers can chill day and night."", ""Surfside – Introducing the first neighborhood made for young families. Adults and kids can stay and play all day between ways to splash, like at the new Water's Edge pool for grownups nearby Baby Bay and the Splashaway Bay aquapark for kids, and new, dedicated dining options such as the Surfside Eatery buffet, Pier 7 for all-day brunch and the convenient Surfside Bites window. To chase down the bites, there's The Lemon Post, a brand-new bar that features two menus – one for adults and the other for kids."", ""AquaDome – A tranquil oasis by day and vibrant hot spot at night, the new neighborhood is filled with wraparound ocean views, new and returning restaurants and bars, a 55-foot-tall water curtain, and the next-level AquaTheater that debuts the first cast of robots, skateboarders, divers and more. From Royal Caribbean's first foodhall, AquaDome Market, and Rye & Bean – a new bar for lattes and coffee-infused cocktails – to the new Overlook bar and pods, and the cruise line's marquee aqua shows, it's a transformational experience."", 'The Hideaway – Tucked away and sitting 135 feet above the ocean is a new neighborhood that combines the good vibes of beach club scenes around the world. The first suspended infinity pool at sea is at the center of it all, and it has 180-degree ocean views that make it the perfect place to watch sunsets from the point of view only a cruise can offer as vacationers enjoy the dedicated DJ and bar.', ""Royal Promenade – The heartbeat of Icon features more than 15 restaurants, bars and lounges, including Dueling Pianos, Royal Caribbean's first dueling pianos bar; the new 1400 Lobby Bar, inspired by the history of shipbuilding, with an ocean-facing terrace that opens the reimagined neighborhood to the outdoors for the first time; and favorites with a twist like Giovanni's Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar, Starbucks and more. The all-time favorite also debuts floor-to-ceiling ocean views, an engineering feat made possible by The Pearl, the world's largest kinetic art sculpture."", ""Central Park – Lusher and livelier than ever, the open-air neighborhood is reimagined with more ways to dine, drink and be entertained. Thousands of real plants line new experiences and favorites with a twist, such as the popular Izumi, with a new location and a walkup window; and American steakhouse Chops Grille. Making their debut are spots like Empire Supper Club, an extravagant experience that pairs eight courses with wine, cocktails and music; and Lou's Jazz 'n Blues, for live performances of soulful jazz, jazzy pop music and more."", ""Suite Neighborhood – Spanning four decks, Royal Caribbean's most expansive Suite Neighborhood features larger suites, the new Grove Suite Sun Deck, complete with a private pool, whirlpool and dedicated Mediterranean dining; and a now two-level Coastal Kitchen with views of the AquaDome and the ocean."", ""Icon\xa0is also the cruise line's first ship that can be powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG), a transitional fuel. The dual-fuel engines will work alongside a lineup of energy efficiency initiatives and industry-leading environmental programs on board, like the first waste-to-energy plant at sea. Twenty-four percent more energy efficient than the standards required for ships being designed today, the cruise line's most sustainable ship yet will mark the next step in parent company Royal Caribbean Group's journey to introduce a net-zero cruise ship by 2035."", ""Every type of family and adventurer can get away on the world's best vacation and island hop in the tropics at any time of the year. Each\xa07-night Eastern or Western Caribbean adventure\xa0from\xa0Miami features idyllic destinations across the Caribbean and an unmatched day of thrill and and chill at Royal Caribbean's award-winning private island,\xa0Perfect Day at CocoCay in The Bahamas.

His role is crucial in overseeing the company's worldwide operations, ensuring that the production and distribution of ADI's products meet the highest standards of efficiency and quality. Jain's position places him at the heart of the company's operational strategies, making his trading activities particularly noteworthy for investors seeking insights into the company's internal dynamics."", ""Analog Devices Inc is a global semiconductor company specializing in data conversion, signal processing, and power management technology. With a market cap of $90.915 billion, ADI plays a pivotal role in converting real-world phenomena into actionable insights through its integrated circuits (ICs).

The company's innovative solutions are designed to bridge the physical and digital worlds, making it a key player in the ever-evolving tech landscape."", ""Insider trading activities, particularly sells, can provide valuable clues about a company's health and future prospects. In the case of Analog Devices Inc, the insider transaction history shows a pattern of more sells than buys over the past year. Specifically, there have been 21 insider sells and no insider buys, indicating that insiders may perceive the stock's current price as favorable for liquidation, or they might be diversifying their personal portfolios for reasons unrelated to the company's performance."", ""On the day of Vivek Jain's recent sell, ADI's shares were trading at $183.66, giving the company a substantial market cap. The price-earnings ratio stands at 28.01, slightly above the industry median, suggesting a higher valuation compared to peers.

259,429b1965-407e-3488-bfa5-2fa39ab33f42,ADI,2023-11-29,Michael Burry Is Betting Against Chip Stocks: 3 Sells I Agree With,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/michael-burry-betting-against-chip-120000896.html,1700740800,STORY,"['AVGO', 'TXN', 'ADI']","['Iconic “Big Short” investor, Michael Burry, has shorted these chip stocks to sell. The latest round of 13-F filings revealed that Burry’s Scion Capital Management shorted Blackrock’s (NYSE:BLK) iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) with\xa0100,000\xa0Put options. The nominal value of Burry’s short position stands at approximately $47 million, which is nearly half of Scion’s liquidity. As such, I think it’s safe to say that Burry’s semiconductor short is a conviction play.', 'SOXX ETF has a concentrated portfolio, with its top ten holdings spanning nearly 60% of its asset base. Therefore, I have reason to believe that Burry’s trade targeted a few of the big chip makers instead of the industry as a whole.', 'Although I’m not overly bearish on chip makers, I think a few will retrace in the following quarters. Let’s discuss three chip stocks to sell.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com', 'Michael Burry isn’t the only noteworthy market participant with a bearish outlook on Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). In fact, David Tepper’s\xa0Appaloosa recently disposed\xa0of its Broadcom position. Moreover, Broadcom’s more than\xa075% year-to-date surge\xa0has led to an abrupt increase in AVGO\xa0stock’s put/call ratio, which currently sits above three. Therefore, it appears like many tactical investors are starting to downscale their Broadcom bets by either hedging or short selling.', 'Furthermore, Broadcom is in the midst of an acquisition. The firm is set to acquire VMware (NYSE:VMW) for\xa0$69 billion, subject to final regulatory approval. Although VMware may add long-term value, Broadcom’s stock could suffer from\xa0merger arbitrage, a market-based anomaly that says acquiring companies’ stocks tend to drop after an acquisition before regaining momentum once synergies occur. Thus, I believe the VMWare deal presents additional substance to a short-term revision in Broadcom’s stock price.', 'Lastly, key metrics suggest that AVGO stock is cyclically overvalued. For example, the stock’s price-to-sales ratio of\xa011.63x is nearly 67% higher\xa0than its 5-year average. In addition, Broadcom’s enterprise value-to-earnings before interest and tax multiple of 21.56x is more than 33% higher than its 5-year average. Therefore, I conclude that recent events paired with AVGO stock’s price multiples communicate that the asset is set for a drawdown.', 'Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com', 'Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is in a difficult period. The company’s stock has plummeted by\xa0almost 10%\xa0in the past six months owing to a series of misfortunes, including a significant third-quarter revenue miss. I’m a big Texas Instruments fan. However, as illustrated by its recent performance, the stock is in a tizzy and probably worth staying away from for the time being.', 'As already mentioned, Texas Instruments suffered a third-quarter revenue miss. The company’s top line settled at\xa0$4.53 billion, missing by $56.13 million. Much of the firm’s quarterly headwinds stemmed from weakening industrial production, which could remain a concern as the economy resumes its decendance. Furthermore, Texas Instruments’ quarterly net income slumped by\xa026% to $1.7 billion, indicating that lower global input costs were not sufficient to save Texas Instruments’ bottom line.', 'Another factor to consider is that many investors hold exposure to Texas Instruments as a “bird in hand” play. The firm has escalated its dividend payouts for\xa020 straight years compounded at 25% annually, placing TXN stock’s dividend yield at\xa03.32%. However, diminishing industrial demand and resilient input costs have sent the stock’s\xa0free cash flow margin\xa0into negative territory. Therefore, the question beckons: Will we see a TXN stock sell-off from its dividend loyalists?', 'In my view, TXN is one of the chip stocks to sell.', 'Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com', 'Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) has an outlook problem. The company released its fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, revealing an earnings miss of one cent per share. Furthermore, the firm’s management provided an underwhelming first-quarter outlook with a revenue estimate of $2.5 billion. If the outlook is realized, Analog’s first-quarter revenue would be 8% lower quarter-on-quarter, trivially leading to an unwanted scenario.', 'In a similar vein to Texas Instruments, Analog suffered from waning industrial demand during its third quarter. The segment’s quarterly revenue landed just shy of\xa0$1.7 billion, a 20% year-over-year decline. Although Analog Devices’ quarterly automotive revenue grew by 14% year-over-year, its communications and consumer revenue dipped by 32% and 28% apiece, conveying near firm-wide demand struggles.', 'Even though I foresee a recovery in Analog Devices’ communication revenue, the interest rate cycle has a long way to go before industrial and automotive demand hits sustainable levels. Sure, ADI stock’s price-to-earnings ratio of 24.69x isn’t bad for a growth stock. However, industry-based systematic and fundamental risk factors will likely prevail, consequently sending ADI stock into a slump.', 'On the date of publication, Steve Booyens did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip our overview of the gold industry and some recent developments, then take a look at the 5 Most Undervalued Gold Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. ', ""The gold industry is one of the most interesting sectors on the stock market. This is because while most industries, save the banking sector, deal with the needs of either financial or non financial customers, gold companies sell their products for both investment and general use purposes. Gold is one of the oldest safe haven assets in the world, with its rarity and use in jewelry ascribing it a higher price than other metals such as copper. Its use as a financial assets has also made the gold industry quite important these days, particularly after the significant financial turmoil that we've seen in global equities and bond markets."", 'This turmoil has come in the wake of rapid interest rate hikes by central banks to clamp down on inflation. The interest rate increases are nothing short of historic, and they have continued to cause disruption in the bond market as securities issued during an era of lower rates have dropped in value. Since global central banks hold U.S. Treasury bonds as their assets, this rapid drop in value has seen them scurry to diversify their portfolios and ensure that the value does not significantly fluctuate.\\', ""Don't Miss: Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now"", ""Data from the World Gold Council shows that as of September 2023, central banks had bought 35 tons of gold on average per month year to date. This means that the banks have bought 315 tons this year, and leading the pack are Asian and European countries. The bulk of these purchases come from developing or emerging markets, and the top three central bank gold purchasers in September were Chinese, Polish, and Uzbekistani banks. However, among these, only China and Poland remained net purchases while Uzbekistan rebuilt some of its gold assets that it has continued to sell this year. So far, China has added roughly 200 tons to its portfolio, and with 2023 coming to an end, it'll be interesting to see how one of the biggest economies in the world closes out its gold holdings."", ""One of the key reasons why central banks buy gold is when the U.S. dollar surges in value and causes their own currencies to depreciate. In a high interest rate era, the dollar is the ultimate safe haven asset even though gold might be shinier. This is because while gold might be a store of value, it does not pay interest which naturally leads to stronger demand for the dollar. Yet, since not everyone can benefit from higher interest rates offered by U.S. Treasuries or bank accounts, the demand for gold naturally remains high when economies are slowing down. Gold now accounts for 4% of China's reserves, and data also shows that a large portion of the gold bought by the country comes from regular people who are looking to protect their wealth amidst a weak Chinese economy and a depreciating currency."", 'The tight link of gold with global financial markets also makes it a barometer of sorts for global risk appetite. While the dollar reigns supreme in a high rate environment, as soon as investors sniff rate cuts, it drops and gold starts to rise. This is also the case at the tail end of November, as gold prices have now hit a six month high to trade at $2,013.99 ahead of a crucial inflation report that is widely believed to cement the end of the era of interest rate hikes.', ""With gold prices rising and central banks piling into the metal, gold companies are also making billions. For instance, here's what the management of Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) shared during its latest earnings call:"", 'In the first nine months, we generated nearly $1.2 billion of operating cashflow, and after reinvesting in our operations and project pipeline, we generated over $400 million of free cashflow.

Tasiast had a record production quarter, producing 171,000 ounces, was once again our highest cashflow operation. Paracatu also performed well in the third quarter, and as planned, had its highest production quarter of the year. La Coipa was once again our lowest cost operation and also generated strong cashflow.

But the supply of existing homes will still be tight and renting will remain a competitive option in most markets. This year's forecast also includes price and sales predictions for the top 100 U.S. metros (see table at bottom)."", 'Overall in 2024, Realtor.com® forecasts that buyers and sellers can expect:', 'Average mortgage rates of 6.8%, with rates edging down over the year to reach 6.5% by the end of the year.', 'Home prices to ease slightly and drop by 1.7% after generally increasing since 2012.', 'Rents to drop by 0.2%, making renting a more budget-friendly option than buying in most markets.', 'A -14% year-over-year drop in inventory, as existing homeowners with low mortgage rates stay put.', 'Home sales to hold steady, rising 0.1% year over year to 4.07 million.', '""Our 2024 housing forecast reveals the green shoots we\'ve been waiting to see in the housing market and should give buyers some optimism after a grueling few years. Although mortgage rates are expected to ease throughout the course of the year, the continuation of high costs will mean that existing homeowners will continue to have a high threshold for deciding to move, but we will start to see some interest,"" said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com®. ""Moves of necessity – for job changes, family situation changes, and downsizing to a more affordable market – are likely to drive home sales in 2024. Home buyers will continue to seek out markets where they feel like they get the most out of their dollar as they look for homes that better meet their needs.""', 'Key 2023 housing trends and wildcards ', 'Affordability will officially turn around in 2024!! In 2024, the typical monthly purchase cost for the median priced home listing is expected to be slightly less than $2,200/month, or about 35% of the typical household income. That\'s an improvement from 2023, when purchase costs ate up nearly 37% of income and the typical for-sale home cost $2,240. This tick up in affordability will give a foothold to some buyers trying to break into the market. Buyers planning to get into the market this year should use Realtor.com®\'s Buying Power tool which uses results from the affordability calculator to tag homes as ""affordable,"" ""stretching,"" or ""difficult"" based on typical lending criteria.', 'Even more sellers hang back, but they could get motivated if rates drop faster than forecasted. Despite the fact that builders have been catching up, the lack of excess capacity in housing has been obvious over the last few years. With home sales activity forecasted to continue at a relatively low pace, the number of unsold homes on the market is also expected to remain low. But if rates drop faster than expected (which is possible given the roughly half point decline seen in November 2023), this could lessen rate lock sooner and bring more homes to the market than forecasted. ', 'Shiny new rental construction will hit the market. A once-hot rental market has slowed down, with the rental vacancy rate rising slightly, up to 6.6% in the third quarter of 2023, about where it was right before the pandemic. In 2024, an increase in new rentals will help push vacancy higher, closer to the 7.2% average seen from 2013-2019. While the surge in new rental options gives renters more to choose from, the sheer number of renters will minimize the potential price impact. The median asking rent in 2024 is expected to drop only slightly below its 2023 level (-0.2%).', 'Sellers should be ready to compete with new construction. Home sales will likely be driven by moves of necessity in 2024. And even with the lower inventory of existing homes, sellers will be competing with new housing. Single-family home housing starts will increase an estimated 0.4% in 2024. Sellers will need to look at the new construction market in their area to make sure pricing and marketing are competitive.', ""Geopolitics and inflation are among 2024's wildcards: Even as markets adjusted to Russia's war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East heated up to historic levels in the 4th quarter of 2023. Both wars have the potential to affect the global economy in ways that can't be fully anticipated. On the domestic front, the 2024 election season, with its attendant uncertainty, will be in full swing. And while inflation is expected to continue to subside, anything that reverses that trend could raise long-term interest rates, and in turn nudge mortgage rates higher than expected. That might discourage potential sellers from making a move and could keep potential buyers on the sidelines, putting a damper on home sales."", '""Buyers and sellers who are planning to get into the market this year should be prepared. Tools like Realtor.com®\'s RealCost™\xa0rent vs. buy and affordability calculators can help buyers ensure they are making a sound financial decision based on current interest rates and their personal financial situation.

The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$278 and falling to the lows of US$250. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Snap-on's current trading price of US$271 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Snap-on’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Snap-on ', 'The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 18% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Snap-on today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $331.03, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Snap-on’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.', ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Snap-on, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 2.4%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term."", 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in SNA’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SNA, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

To skip the detailed analysis of widow and orphan stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy.', 'Widow and orphan stocks are well-established blue-chip companies that pay out stable dividends, have low volatility, and grow steadily over time. These companies are most suitable for vulnerable investors with a low knowledge of the stock market, like retirees, widows, and orphans. The term was coined in the 1930s for stocks that are mature enough to weather economic turbulence. Widow and orphan stocks is an outdated term for low-volatility investments.', 'One of the most attractive features of widow and orphan stocks is that these companies have the ability to maintain their dividend payments during tough times. For example, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been increasing its dividend for the past 67 years, which means that the company was able to sustain itself through several recessions, including the Black Monday of 1987, The Great Financial Crisis, and the COVID-19 recessions along with the aftermath of Russia-Ukraine war.', 'While widow and orphan stocks might be considered safe investments, they still have their drawbacks. These companies have stable growth, but in a bull market, these stocks cannot take advantage of favorable market conditions like growth stocks due to their low volatility. This might not apply to a few companies on our list, such as Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), as these companies have recorded major profits and losses in the last few decades. However, these oil Supermajors have still maintained their dividends for decades despite heavy losses suffered in 2016 and 2020 as they are fundamentally strong.', 'The stock market has performed better than expected in 2023 as the S&P 500 is up over 19%, and the NASDAQ-100 is up 47.5% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of writing on November 28. Despite the strong performance due to the boom in the technology sector, some analysts still believe that a recession could hit the US economy in 2024. If we consider their prediction, investing in safe and stable companies like the widow and orphan stocks can safeguard investments. Widow and orphan stocks are also perfect investments for beginners with little knowledge of the stock market.', 'Some of the best widow and orphan stocks include Walmart Inc.

High-yield dividend stocks offer a reliable stream of income, making them attractive for investors seeking regular cash flow. Additionally, high dividend yields can indicate financial strength and stability in a company, as firms typically need consistent earnings to sustain such payouts. Historical analysis also shows that high-dividend stocks have shown stronger performance than the overall market. According to a report by Newton Investment Management, over the span of 1940 to 2021, stocks exhibiting high dividend yields often showcased a trend of outperforming the broader market during periods characterized by high inflation.', ""This year, dividend stocks have taken a back seat as technology stocks, driven by the expanding realm of artificial intelligence, have captured investors' focus. Bloomberg Intelligence notes a relatively low influx of just $786 million into dividend ETFs, marking the smallest flow since 2006. Despite this, analysts hold an optimistic view of dividend growth stocks. These stocks typically offer investors a consistent and increasing stream of income over time. The appeal lies in their ability to provide shareholders with a reliable source of growing dividends, making them an attractive option despite the recent surge in interest toward tech-related investments."", 'Kirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, advises investors to consider both price gains and dividend income for their overall return. Dividend-paying stocks hold additional benefits as their regular income can offset losses during market dips, providing balance in a portfolio. Moreover, in times of low interest rates, these stocks might offer higher income compared to Treasury bonds, CDs, or corporate bonds. Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“Companies that have consistently increased their dividends tend to be more stable, higher quality businesses, which historically have weathered downturns and are more likely to have the ability to pay dividends consistently.”', 'Cabacungan suggests that if your aim is to generate consistent income, focusing on stocks with higher-than-average dividend yields over an extended period could be beneficial. However, for investors seeking growth without an immediate need for income, she recommends considering stocks known for consistently increasing dividends as their cash flows and profits grow. This approach aligns with a more growth-oriented strategy, allowing investors to benefit from companies that demonstrate a track record of boosting dividends over time. Verizon Communications Inc.

This capability, designed for network traffic on Verizon’s new cloud-native, containerized, virtualized standalone 5G core, will offer unprecedented levels of service agility, flexibility, and automated scalability.', 'In this demonstration on Verizon’s live 5G network in Phoenix, AZ, Axon ran side-by-side tests of its Axon Fleet 3 and Axon Respond solutions. The Axon Fleet 3 in-car video system provides live maps and live streaming from mobile cameras along with real-time situational awareness through Axon Respond to help enhance situational awareness for law enforcement members not on the scene.', '“When engaging in a public safety incident, accurate and timely live streaming and location information is mission critical for enhancing law enforcement’s situational awareness and its ability to make decisions based on real-time, accurate information,” said Axon Senior Director of Product Management Black Bullock. “Our work with Verizon’s 5G lower latency network slice improved streaming rate success and accelerated time to first frame for our Axon Fleet 3 Respond services under both network congestion and cell edge conditions.”', 'In this demonstration, one video feed was run over a network slice on Verizon’s commercial 5G Ultra Wideband network and 5G Standalone core. The other test was run simultaneously over Verizon’s commercial 5G Ultra Wideband network without network slicing.', 'Results of the trial', 'The test results were measured in four categories.', 'The time to first frame, which is the time between when a remote law enforcement officer requests a stream and when that officer can remotely access the live stream.', 'Start percent, or the percent of time the stream started before timing out and causing the law enforcement officer not on the scene to potentially abandon remotely accessing video and call into law enforcement personnel on the scene instead.', 'Latency, or the responsiveness of the application across the network.', 'Jitter, which is the sequence and timing of the audio and video packages being sent across the network.', 'The results showed the application, while running over a Verizon network slice, had sustained performance levels. Compared to Verizon’s commercial 5G Ultra Wideband network, services on the network slice showed:', '53% improvement in 95th percentile of time to first frame', '5% improvement in start percent', '68% improvement in latency', '83% improvement in jitter', '“This most recent network slicing demonstration shows one of many use cases where network slicing can be a game-changer for our enterprise, public sector, and Verizon Frontline customers,” said Adam Koeppe, SVP of Network and Technology Planning for Verizon. “We have undergone a massive transformation of our network over the past few years, including building on a cloud-native architecture, virtualizing from the core to the edge, building an advanced 5G standalone core, driving capacity in our fiber core, adding robust and varied spectrum assets, and infusing intelligence throughout the network. These changes allow us to develop and test this new technology that effectively matches the required network resources with the performance characteristics needed for an app or use case to work effectively.”', 'What is network slicing?', 'This unique 5G capability uses a virtualized network infrastructure to dynamically match network performance characteristics to specific application requirements, while optimizing the network performance to support all services. The advanced capabilities, high speed, increased bandwidth, and low latency of 5G is inspiring development of a wide variety of new use cases that include everything from massive numbers of IoT devices that use very few network resources, to smartphone applications that use data in countless ways, to more complex solutions such as gaming, AR/VR and mixed reality that will require massive computing capabilities and low latency on the edge of the network. Those solutions would each benefit from different combinations of network capabilities. The 5G standalone core’s cloud-native virtualized applications, in combination with built-in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), will enable the dynamic allocation of the appropriate resources, referred to as network slicing. It will also allow for automated network configuration changes, including the ability to scale up or scale down network function capacity in real time - to provide the right service levels and network resources needed for each use case.', 'For example, utility company smart readers use very little bandwidth, are not latency sensitive, and do not need mobility routing functions as they are in a fixed position attached to homes and do not move. This use case would require fewer network resources. Alternatively, massive multi-player online gaming in a mobile environment would benefit from certain upload and download speeds and low latency to work effectively and provide players an immersive experience on a mobile device. In each case, using network slicing, Verizon would be able to better match network performance to application requirements. In short, dynamic network resource provisioning allows the network to dynamically support the experience customers should get for the applications they are using and efficiently provide that specific service level when resources are available.', 'Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) was formed on June 30, 2000 and is one of the world’s leading providers of technology and communications services.

To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$3.79b', 'US$4.42b', 'US$4.62b', 'US$4.53b', 'US$4.96b', 'US$5.10b', 'US$5.24b', 'US$5.38b', 'US$5.51b', 'US$5.65b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x3', 'Est @ 2.96%', 'Est @ 2.74%', 'Est @ 2.58%', 'Est @ 2.47%', 'Est @ 2.40%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% ', 'US$3.6k', 'US$3.9k', 'US$3.9k', 'US$3.6k', 'US$3.7k', 'US$3.6k', 'US$3.4k', 'US$3.3k', 'US$3.2k', 'US$3.1k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$35b', ""We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

Given that we are looking at McKesson as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt.

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', '-US$955.2m', '-US$908.9m', 'US$365.0m', 'US$3.59b', 'US$4.36b', 'US$4.94b', 'US$5.43b', 'US$5.84b', 'US$6.19b', 'US$6.49b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x9', 'Analyst x9', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 13.17%', 'Est @ 9.88%', 'Est @ 7.58%', 'Est @ 5.97%', 'Est @ 4.85%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% ', '-US$890', '-US$790', 'US$296', 'US$2.7k', 'US$3.1k', 'US$3.2k', 'US$3.3k', 'US$3.3k', 'US$3.3k', 'US$3.2k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21b', ""The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Air Products and Chemicals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.011. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

F4A was created in 1994 to forbid states from enacting or enforcing a law related to the price, route or service of any motor carrier. This act has given freight brokers substantial protections over the years because even though brokers have MCs (motor carrier numbers), it’s not the same type of MC as a carrier because a broker doesn’t physically move the freight.', 'Bringing it forward to current events, there have been three major court cases over the last few years that have brought F4A to the Supreme Court for ruling, as there now are conflicting rulings at the circuit level.', 'Of the aforementioned cases, two support the broker exemption for F4A and one doesn’t :', 'Ye v.

Lin was riding a motorcycle in November 2017 when he collided with a truck driven by a driver for a company named Global Sunrise, which had been hired by Arizona-based GlobalTranz to move freight.”', 'Kingston also brings up in his article, the“guy named James’ case. “When the 7th Circuit decision was handed down, it created a split in the federal circuit court system over whether a broker could be held liable for such an accident, or whether the F4A blocked that finding. In both the Ye case and the ‘guy named James’ case involving Landstar in the 11th Circuit, the F4A was invoked by the ruling appellate panels to hold brokerages not liable.”', 'In Miller v. C.H. Robinson, the 9th Circuit in 2020 held C.H. Robinson liable for injuries suffered by Allen Miller in an accident involving a truck booked by Robinson. The giant brokerage company asked the Supreme Court for review of the decision, but the court denied that request in June 2022.', 'Where that leaves us now is waiting.

Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down what topics Iger remains focused on, including his strategy around the multinational media company's linear TV segment and concerns from activist investor Nelson Peltz."", 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""- Disney has faced a multitude of challenges since CEO Bob Iger stepped back into his position late last year. Today, admitting during an Employee Town Hall, that his return has been more challenging than he anticipated. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal listened in. So Ali, what were the big takeaways?"", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, at the end of the day, Bob Iger says, he is optimistic when it comes to the future of Disney despite all of these challenges. And there's certainly been many. We have the stock trading near multi-year record lows, the park business is slowing, linear television is declining, streaming is still not profitable. And then on the film side of the business, there seems to be more misses than hits."", ""So Bob Iger says that he is optimistic moving forward, because Disney as a brand is a strong one. He also said they've spent the past year fixing a lot of the problems. And now, they are moving on to the building phase. And part of that building phase is going to be really honing in on all the different components of their business, all the different assets, and really determining what the long-term value is there, especially when it comes to future growth opportunities."", ""We know Bob Iger has hinted before that he's not opposed to a little bit of M&A. He said linear networks open to all options there. But he sort of downplayed those comments today, saying that they might be part of the Disney strategy moving forward."", ""Dana Walden, who's the head of Disney entertainment, she actually said linear networks are core to the streaming side of the business. And that seems to be what's dragging down the stock right now because investors, they want to see Disney begin to offload some of those assets. But according to these officials, what we heard today from this Town Hall, maybe not so fast. So we'll have to wait and see if there's any more M&A chatter there."", ""- Yeah, that's really interesting there. And Iger has definitely kind of gone back and forth on a couple of things since he took over. I mean, I think of him, in my mind, as such a decisive guy. But obviously, he's sort of reading the room a little bit perhaps on some of these issues, although, this is not what the market wants to hear."", ""How does all of this line up with what we are hearing on the activist side when it comes to Disney and what we know-- although, I don't know that we know a lot, about what the activists want exactly?"", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, and Bob Iger he said he hasn't heard what Nelson Peltz. He's another activist investor. He came back from the dead. It seems like fighting for more board seats there. He-- Bob Iger hasn't given us too much on what he's asking for there. But I think you can go back to the stock price really. That's what investors are focused on. That's what these activists are focused on. And Bob Iger has said he's focused on the shareholders as well and creating some of that shareholder value."", ""Now, the easiest way to do that is potentially selling off assets. But you also have to take a critical look at your cost, a critical look at the amount of employees at the company, which Bob Iger has done. I mean, he's laid off a ton of employees. He actually increased the cost cutting measures by $2 billion after saying he was going to costs by $5.5 billion in February. So he's committed to a lot of changes."", 'Now, entering into 2024, I think a big question is going to be, how will these changes be reflected on the operations side of the business? And investors did cheer the last earnings report. Analysts said Disney got its ""mojo back."" There seems to be some good things, but we\'re still severely underperforming the broader market there, and the stock is still struggling. So still some answers, I think, that we need next year.', '- Yeah. At the very least, we know that the activists want the stock price to go up.', 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: Exactly. Yes.', ""- I think that one's pretty simple. Ali, thank you so much. Appreciate it.""]"

It will be provided to market infrastructures, registry platforms, and other service providers globally.', 'The service will ultimately support the development and institutionalization of global carbon markets.\xa0Despite being a relatively young market the carbon credit operating model is characterized by bilateral trading and a heavy reliance on manual interaction, providing limited ability to scale as the market develops. This inflexibility has also led to an absence of standardization – where credit data can be categorized and integrated into existing systems – which is a major barrier to attracting significant capital flows.', 'The technology will allow market operators and registries to create standardized digital credits and distribute them with full auditability throughout the transaction lifecycle. Nasdaq has also developed a carbon taxonomy framework that can readily incorporate new types of credit as the market evolves, along with a comprehensive set of APIs that will allow participants to seamlessly interact across the market. Together, this will help establish a standardized, trusted ecosystem capable of attracting high-quality liquidity from a variety of investors. ', '“Fragmented technology choices in the trading and settlement of carbon credits has prevented the carbon industry from growing and maturing as an asset class. A lack of system flexibility, standardization, and connectivity has made it challenging for critical infrastructure providers and institutional investors to access the market in a meaningful way,” said Roland Chai, Executive Vice President and Head of Marketplace Technology at Nasdaq. “Bringing institutional grade technology to underpin the market will drive ever-greater liquidity across carbon marketplaces and open the possibility of greater interoperability between registries in the future.”', 'The service will utilize smart contract technology, allowing customers to securely create and process rights, obligations, and other information relating to the underlying asset. By automating several asset servicing and settlement procedures, the technology has the power to enhance efficiency and transparency throughout the trade lifecycle and provide a complete audit trail of credit ownership and retirement. The technology can also be used to reimagine current multiparty workflows in industries where paper, manual processes, and risk are obstacles to growth.', 'The issuance, settlement, and custody capabilities can be readily integrated with existing technology architectures used across the financial system, or deployed as a standalone platform, while also offering flexibility to connect to existing payment networks and bilateral settlement options. This will allow infrastructure providers to continue serving traditional markets, whilst also capturing growth opportunities from carbon markets, without the cost associated with major change programs.', 'Additionally, Nasdaq offers infrastructure optionality that enables the technology to be deployed on either a centralized database or using private blockchain technology.', 'Nasdaq announces technology partnership with Puro.earth', 'Alongside the launch of the service, Nasdaq has today announced a new technology partnership with Puro.earth, a world-leading standards and registry platform for engineered carbon removal, to register CO2 Removal Certificates, or CORCs. The registry tracks the issuance, retirement, and the transfer of the assets, providing full traceability and transparency to avoid double counting carbon removal projects.', 'Gerard Smith, Vice President, Digital Assets & Carbon for Marketplace Technology at Nasdaq, commented: “This is a great example of how our technology can support the growth of the voluntary carbon removal market, which still places a heavy reliance on manual interactions and onerous data collection tools. By providing a comprehensive set of APIs, alongside standardized contracts, Puro.earth can seamlessly interact with a full range of market participants.”', 'Antti Vihavainen, CEO of Puro.earth, added: “Accurately managing the lifecycle of carbon credits is essential for trust. By leveraging Nasdaq’s technology, the core part of our carbon crediting infrastructure, the Puro Registry will be modernized. The system will become available for carbon marketplaces and exchanges through the Puro Connect API and will also have the preparedness for labeling CORCs compliant with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.”', 'The company’s Puro Standard is the first carbon removal standard for engineered carbon removal methods in the voluntary carbon market. It consists of high-quality carbon removal methodologies, aligned with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change definition for carbon removal.', 'Certified suppliers and their carbon removals are verified by an independent third-party and the CORCs can be bought by companies seeking to offset their carbon footprint directly from suppliers or through a third-party marketplace.', 'About Nasdaq ', 'Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) is a leading global technology company serving corporate clients, investment managers, banks, brokers, and exchange operators as they navigate and interact with the global capital markets and the broader financial system.

However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more."", ""Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing."", "" View our latest analysis for McDonald's "", ""The President, Christopher Kempczinski, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.6m worth of shares at a price of US$280 each. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$282, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 16% of Christopher Kempczinski's holding."", ""Over the last year we saw more insider selling of McDonald's shares, than buying.

This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap."", ""I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that McDonald's insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$242m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders."", ""Insiders sold McDonald's shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But since McDonald's is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.

McDonald's Corp's 3-year EPS growth rate of 8.80% per year and 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 6.80% further demonstrate its capacity to sustain dividends and growth."", ""In conclusion, McDonald's Corp's consistent dividend growth, prudent payout ratio, strong profitability, and solid growth metrics collectively suggest a favorable outlook for dividend sustainability. For investors, McDonald's Corp represents a compelling option for those seeking reliable dividend income with the potential for growth.

Thank you for joining us today. Q2 improved on our solid start to FY '24 in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of guidance, while our operational discipline yielded company all-time highs for gross margin, operating margin and EPS. We remain relentlessly focused on managing the elements within our control while driving better performance in our storage business and building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We are seeing positive results from these actions with increased profitability and a stronger position for delivering long-term growth. In Q2, we held our INSIGHT user conference where I witnessed the tangible excitement for the silo-free innovation our unified data storage provides. It was invigorating to be with the thousands of attendees and hear stories of the extraordinary outcomes NetApp delivers for our customers. NetApp is at the forefront of the evolution of the storage industry, helping our customers turn disruption into opportunity with intelligent data infrastructure. Today's organizations need storage infrastructure that harnesses the power of public and hybrid clouds while keeping data secure and protected from ransomware attacks. They need infrastructure that supports dynamic workloads like AI, cloud-native and open-source applications. And they need infrastructure that helps to create more sustainable data centers. Only NetApp delivers an entire architecture of unified data storage solutions based on one operating system, ONTAP, that supports any application, any data type and spans on-premises and multiple cloud environments. This comprehensive architecture delivers unparalleled simplicity of management, simplicity of deployment and consistency of automation, all unified by common APIs and a single control plane. We further elevate the customer experience with our BlueXP sustainability dashboard and NetApp Advance, a common set of programs and guarantees that include Storage Lifecycle Program, which removes the burden of upgrade cycles as well as storage efficiency, ransomware recovery and data availability guarantees. Intelligent data infrastructure combines unified data storage, integrated data services, and intelligent operations so customers can operate with seamless flexibility to deploy new applications, unify their data for AI and simplify data protection in a world of limited IT resources, rapid data growth and increased cybersecurity threats. Looking at the results of the quarter, momentum from new products and the go-to-market changes we made at the start of the year drove 10% quarter-over-quarter growth in hybrid cloud segment revenue to $1.4 billion. Our all-flash array business benefited from the growth of the AFF C-Series, increasing 14% from Q1 to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.2 billion. The AFF C-Series all-flash array continues to exceed our expectations, delivering new-to-NetApp customers and numerous wins over the competition. In the quarter, we successfully competed against an All-Flash competitor with C-Series to win a $16 million deal at an Infrastructure-as-a-Service company. The customer was looking for new storage to host a broad variety of critical applications. Our ease of management for large storage environments, unique data resilience, common toolkit across all our storage systems and the right price/performance ratio secured our win despite the competitor's attempt to use price once they realized their value proposition was insufficient. ONTAP One, our all-in-one software license that gives customers access to the industry's most comprehensive data management suite, has laid the groundwork for future tech refresh and expansion opportunities. Building on the success of the C-Series, we introduced block-optimized and AI-ready versions. The ASA C-Series family is a solution tailored to deliver high-performance and guaranteed high availability storage for critical applications, databases and VMware infrastructure, coupled with capacity flash to make enterprise-grade block storage more affordable and sustainable than ever. We added the AFF C-Series to the ONTAP AI architecture, lowering the overall cost of entry to scalable AI without sacrificing performance. Keystone, our Storage as a Service offering, is also growing rapidly. In Q2, we added performance and availability guarantees to Keystone, expanding on the existing sustainability and storage efficiency guarantees, creating a comprehensive program to keep storage operations running optimally. We also announced NetApp storage on Equinix Metal, powered by Keystone, providing customers with a single subscription to a full stack of compute, networking and storage infrastructure with low-latency interconnection to all major public clouds. Turning to Public Cloud. As we said last quarter, our priority is growing first-party cloud storage services. We aligned our cloud sales specialists to our hyperscaler partners' go-to-market structures at the start of the fiscal year and are seeing new customer additions and growth in those services. However, that growth has been masked by weakness in subscription services, which have declined to 23% of public Cloud ARR. During the quarter, we engaged in a strategic review to sharpen the focus of our cloud portfolio. As a result, we will continue to prioritize cloud storage offerings delivered through the hyperscalers while refocusing some services, such as Cloud Insights and Instaclustr, to complement and extend our Hybrid Cloud storage offerings, creating greater differentiation and additional value for customers. We will integrate other services that are sold as stand-alone subscriptions today, such as data protection, into the core functionality of cloud volumes. We will also carefully manage the transition of cloud storage subscription services to align to customer preference for consumption offerings. And we have decided to exit the SaaS backup and virtual desktop services. We anticipate ARR headwinds of approximately $55 million from exited services and unrenewed subscriptions in the second half of fiscal year '24. Growth in first-party and marketplace services are expected to partially offset this decline, positioning us to enter FY '25 with a more focused and much healthier business from which to grow. Now to the results of the quarter. Public Cloud segment revenue in Q2 was $154 million, flat from Q1 and up 8% year-over-year. Our first-party and marketplace offerings are highly differentiated and are tightly aligned with customers' buying preferences. These services grew over 30% from Q2 a year ago. We continue to see customer expansion and deepening partnerships as well as increases in customer count, capacity, revenue and ARR in this part of the portfolio. In Q2, we extended our partnership with Google with the introduction of Google Cloud NetApp volumes. Now we are not only the only vendor to have a natively integrated storage service in the public cloud, but we are natively integrated into all 3 of the leading hyperscale vendors. And we are not standing still with this advantage. Just 2 months after introducing the GCNV service, we announced the availability of a new lower-cost tier of Google Cloud NetApp volumes, expanding the offering to address a greater range of workloads. These partnerships uniquely position and enable us to participate in the innovation and adoption of AI services in the public cloud. As examples, during Q2, we announced support for Google Cloud's Vertex AI with Google Cloud NetApp volumes as well as cross-protocol, hybrid cloud AI pipelines on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP with support for SageMaker Studio notebooks. Our position with the hyperscalers also enables us to displace legacy on-premises competitors as customers migrate workloads to the cloud. A U.S.-based medical equipment company chose FSx for NetApp ONTAP to replace a competitor's SAN systems when they moved their database workloads to the cloud. This is the customer's first engagement with NetApp. Following a successful initial deployment, they are evaluating FSxN for workload consolidation and disaster recovery. Looking forward, our focus is clear and is delivering results. We expect the momentum we saw in Q2 to continue through FY '24 despite continued softness in the demand environment due to the challenging macro. Customers value our modern approach to hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure and data management, which enables IT organizations to leverage data across their entire estate simply, securely and sustainably. With recent innovations that enable us to address a broader set of markets more efficiently, I'm confident that we are well positioned to deliver positive outcomes for customers and stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Mike."", 'Michael J. Berry', ""Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a very solid quarter in what continues to be a challenging macro environment with soft IT spend. Our relentless focus and consistent execution delivered results that met and exceeded our guidance ranges and drove record-setting non-GAAP profitability measures across consolidated gross margin, product gross margin, operating margin and EPS. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Our modern, innovative solutions are resonating with customers and our disciplined operational management drove profitability margins to a record high. As we look ahead, we expect our industry-leading solutions and unwavering focus to drive revenue growth and profitability in the second half of the fiscal year. Q2 consolidated gross margins of 72% and were at an all-time high, driven by product gross margins of 61%, also at an all-time high. Gross margin leverage and the returns on our strategic investments drove record operating margins of 27% and record EPS of $1.58. During the quarter, we returned approximately $403 million to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing share count by 4% versus Q2 '23. Over the course of the year, we expect to return at least 100% of free cash flow to stockholders. Given our growth, profitability and working capital improvements, we expect operating cash flow for the full year to normalize and track relatively in line with net income for the full year. Due to our solid execution and operational efficiencies, we outperformed the second quarter and expect our continued focus and discipline to deliver year-over-year revenue growth in the second half of the year. As a result, we are raising all our guidance measures for fiscal year '24. Now to the details of the quarter. Q2 billings of $1.5 billion decreased 9% year-over-year and revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 6% year-over-year as IT budgets remain constrained in a challenging macro environment. Adjusting for the FX tailwind of 160 basis points, billings and revenue would have decreased 11% and 8% year-over-year, respectively. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 7% year-over-year and product revenue of $706 million decreased 16% year-over-year. As discussed last quarter, the first half of fiscal year '23 revenue and most notably, product revenue benefited from elevated levels of backlog entering fiscal year '23. For the second half of fiscal year '24 year-over-year comparisons should be more apples-to-apples. Support revenue, an attach to our install base and indicative of the value of our products, grew 3% year-over-year to $623 million. We are pleased with the momentum of our product portfolio and our go-to-market initiatives implemented at the start of fiscal year '24. Public Cloud revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $154 million and was relatively flat from Q1 '24. As George noted, year-over-year growth was driven by hyperscaler first-party and marketplace services, partially offset by continued declines in subscription services. Now for our operating results. Q2 consolidated gross margin increased 580 basis points year-over-year to 72%, and product gross margin increased 1,080 basis points year-over-year to 61%. Product gross margin benefited from 3 main factors: number one, a mix shift to higher margin and higher capacity products; number two, favorable COGS stemming from lower component costs and our strategic purchase agreements for NAND. Number three, price discipline in a cost-sensitive, competitive pricing environment. I want to be very clear on this point: there were no unusual or onetime transactions that drove the higher product gross margin results. As we discussed in prior calls, we continue to make strategic purchase commitments to lock in NAND pricing and mitigate margin pressure from rising prices in the future as NAND prices largely bottomed out in Q2. Operating expenses of $706 million were flat year-over-year and grew $3 million quarter-over-quarter. Within a relatively consistent OpEx envelope, we will continue to reallocate investments to areas of higher opportunity to drive long-term growth. In Q2, operating margin increased 320 basis points year-over-year to 27%, which includes 80 basis points of FX tailwind. EPS grew 7% year-over-year to $1.58, which includes a $0.07 FX tailwind. These record results demonstrate the strength of our business model, product relevance and unwavering focus and execution. As expected, Q2 operating cash flow of $135 million was impacted by seasonally lower collections and repatriation tax payments. DSO was 46 and inventory turns were 15. More importantly, year-to-date operating cash flow of $588 million grew 19% year-over-year compared to a decline of 8% in the same period a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $97 million, bringing the year-to-date amount to $515 million, up 46% year-over-year. During the quarter, we returned $403 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $230 million in net cash. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q2 was $4 billion. The slight decline year-over-year is driven by lower multiyear support and public cloud subscription billings. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now turning to guidance. Given the success of our product portfolio and consistent execution on operational improvements, we are raising our fiscal '24 guidance in still a soft IT spending environment. We now expect fiscal year '24 revenues to be down approximately 2% year-over-year, an improvement from our previous guidance. We expect to see continued strength in product and hyperscale or first-party and marketplace services as we work through minor headwinds from Public Cloud subscription services. Consolidated gross margins are expected to be approximately 71%. For the second half, we expect product gross margin to range between 58% to 60% driven by continued mix shift to all-flash products and taking into account the current pricing environment and our commitment to maintain pricing flexibility. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 26% and EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.25 with the assumption of net interest income of approximately $30 million and share count of 212 million. Operating cash flow is expected to move in line with net income, although there will be some quarterly variance based on working capital. In Q3, we expect revenue to range between $1.51 billion and $1.67 billion, which at the midpoint implies an increase of 4% year-over-year. We expect Q3 consolidated gross margins to be roughly 71%, and operating margin to be approximately 28%. EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.74. In closing, I want to thank our customers, employees and investors once again for their steadfast commitment and investment in NetApp. I remain confident in our ability to manage the elements in our control and focus our key priorities to help customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud journeys. Our portfolio is well aligned to priority IT investments, and we are committed to delivering sustainable, long-term value for our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&A. Kris?"", 'Kris Newton', ""Thanks, Mike. Operator, we'll begin the Q&A."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) Today's first question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG."", 'Mehdi Hosseini', ""Two quick follow-ups. Given the updated fiscal year '24 revenue guide, should we assume that the July product revenue of $590 million was essentially the bottom and you would continue to see a sequential improvement in the second half? And the second question has to do with the momentum with some of these higher margin, higher capacity to product. To what extent should we assume these market share has enabled you to ride out a tough IT spend environment?"", 'George Kurian', ""I'll take the second one, and then Mike can take the first, maybe. We feel very good about the momentum with our C-Series portfolio. We are able to serve customer workloads and use cases, particularly at a time of soft IT spending, that we are aligned to the value that they bring. And the software value of ONTAP is particularly useful in these all-flash configurations. We are also expanding the total addressable market with the all-SAN array configuration of the CDs and of the high-performance flash products. So I'm excited about what the future holds for our flash business, and it is because of that momentum and the focus of our go-to-market that we've taken up our guide for the full year."", 'Michael J. Berry', ""Thank you, George. On your question on product revenue, certainly for fiscal '24, implied in the guidance is continued growth and our growth in the second half for the product line. Total revenue growth averages about 4% for the second half. We have not guided for fiscal '25 yet, but we certainly would -- we feel good about going into '25 as it relates to our product portfolio and our operational improvements."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.', 'Meta A. Marshall', ""A couple of questions. Just one, realizing that you're saying there's no kind of major contributor to the gross margin upside, but just how do you see NAND prices increasing, just kind of an outlook on how you see gross margins developing throughout the year and whether these are sustainable? And then just as a second question, do you attribute kind of the more confident in the year to the early success that you're having with C-Series? Do you kind of attribute it to signs you're kind of seeing coming out of INSIGHT? Just kind of what gives you more confidence on the year just given the dampened environment?"", 'Michael J. Berry', ""Meta, this is Mike. I'll take the first one, and then George will take the second one. So the comment in the script was specifically related to no onetime transactions that drove the overachievement product margins. As we look forward through the rest of fiscal '24 and '25, and let's start with the second half of '24, we're currently guiding product gross margins between 58% and 60%. As we all know, we continue to benefit from the lowest component costs we've seen in many years. We have included some room in our guidance to be flexible in pricing as well as mix and capacity. And as we've all seen from the industry analyst reports, we do expect that component pricing has bottomed out in our Q2 and will rise as we go throughout the rest of '24. We do feel very good about our position for the rest of the fiscal year as it relates to purchase agreements that we struck as well as prebuy. Similar to '24, we are looking to extend that into '25, and we'll continue to work with our suppliers as we go through the rest of the year. I'd also note that, hey, historically, though, the storage industry pricing evolves as component pricing changes, and we expect that trend to continue. So all that being said, we feel good about the second half of '24 as we've included in our outlook. As we head into '25, we'll see how things progress as it relates to mix, pricing and component costs, and we'll guide '25 when we get to our Q4 call. With that, I'll hand it to George."", 'George Kurian', ""With regard to your question on the underlying factors that support our optimism in the guide, first of all, from a macro perspective, it's still a challenged macro with the soft demand environment. We saw incremental improvement in North America but equally, a deceleration in certain parts of Europe, mirroring the economic landscape in the public domain. I think within the large enterprise, we see a case-by-case situation in terms of demand and we continue to see a more robust product business in the commercial or mid-market customer base, so no real fundamental change in the demand environment. With regard to the two underlying factors for confidence. One is we are a much more focused go-to-market organization, and we are seeing the second consecutive quarter of pipeline performance from the changes we made at the start of the fiscal year. And so I want to credit our go-to-market teams for their focus and the results that they have delivered this quarter, and that is one of the key contributors. The second is the really strong performance of our all-flash portfolio. We talked in the prepared remarks about a large competitive win against a purely flash competitor. And we see that across multiple segments where we are seeing competitive wins with our portfolio. So those are the two fundamental reasons: go-to-market focus and execution and confidence in our portfolio."", 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.', 'Krish Sankar', ""Actually I have two questions for George. George, first one, kind of like what are the lead times for the storage products today? And what does that imply for your visibility when you look into calendar '24? And the second question is, curious whether on a storage content per customer, have you seen any increase in it because of AI? Or do you think that will happen maybe at some point in the future? Or is there any way to put some time lines around it?"", 'George Kurian', ""With regard to lead times, we are at normal lead times for our portfolio, and we reached those normal lead times a few quarters ago. With regard to the question on storage demand for AI, listen, I think we have been in the AI business, for predictive AI or industrial AI, for 5 years. And there are large data sets that are built out to support training of those models and the implementation of those models across the enterprise. So we have a good and robust business there. We are starting to see early signs of trials and use cases with generative AI. Generative AI is particularly well suited for NetApp's capabilities because it operates on unstructured data: files, documents, video, audio and so on. And so we have large repositories of those with customers, and we are able to use that data set and add to that data set to support AI use cases. This quarter, we won a large AI implementation at a very large U.S. bank that was really focused on generative AI document summarization, analysis and so on, and we are the infrastructure foundation for that. So it will take time for generative AI to become a demand driver. We are seeing early positive signs there."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Steven Fox of Fox Advisors.', 'Steven Bryant Fox', ""I had two questions on the product business. So first of all, I'm not fully understanding what you're saying about the pricing environment. At one point you said you maintained disciplined pricing and then you said you would be flexible going forward with pricing. So can you sort of give us a sense for how challenging or not challenging it is to hold pricing in these gross margins? And the second one is related to the product gross margins. I'm just still trying to get a sense for how sustainable this last quarter and the guidance for the next quarter is in terms of product gross margins, even if we adjust for the changes in NAND pricing."", 'George Kurian', ""Listen, on pricing, we've been in this industry for a very long period of time. And while there will be people who are vendors who are aggressive in any particular transaction or other, depending on their own strategic reasons, overall, we don't see fundamental changes in the pricing environment. Clearly, the room with lower component costs gives you an opportunity to do more in terms of pricing flexibility. But I think that our past quarter's gross margin results are a demonstration of the fact that we've been able to maintain pricing discipline at a time where demand is soft, and it talks to both the differentiation of our product portfolio and the execution in our field teams. I'll have Mike talk a bit about your second question."", 'Michael J. Berry', ""Thanks, George. And I'll refer to George's comments, Steve, when I talk about the sustainability. So we finished at 61% product margins in Q2. We guided a range of 50% to 60% in the back half. We feel very good about our component costs and the view of that for the rest of our fiscal '24. The reason why we guided slightly lower than Q2 from a margin perspective, that's exactly what George talked about, which is we feel really good about our pricing discipline in our products, but we want to make sure and leave room to be flexible should we need that in the second half. That's the one part of the equation that we don't control as much as the cost. So hopefully, that helps. We would not have guided that range if we didn't feel good about it for the second half, Steve."", 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Asiya Merchant with Citi.', 'Asiya Merchant', ""Maybe just a little bit on the macro, clearly, you're executing really well. Should we expect slightly better than seasonal growth for you guys in the second half, just given the fact that you guys are ramping on a new product? And then just broadly on the macro, are we starting to see more adoption of flash across the customer base in general as people start to appreciate maybe more -- pricing being more attractive? Or is this something that was specific to NetApp just given the success that you're seeing in your C-Series?"", 'George Kurian', ""I'll take the second, and Mike will cover the first question. Thank you for the question. Listen, I think that with regard to customer adoption of flash-based technologies, we saw the high-performance landscape moved to flash several years ago, and there's been a steady movement of that footprint to flash. That is about 15% to 20% of the overall storage market, maybe 20%. The next tranche of use cases are more in the general-purpose application footprint. These are in the process of migrating over multiple years. We are in the early innings of that migration. And so we feel very good about the position of our flash portfolio to attack that part of the market. It is essentially the 10K hard drive market that is about 30% to 40% of the hard drive market, so you'll see that move over time. And so I'll let Mike talk to the first question you had."", 'Michael J. Berry', 'Sure. On your question, Asiya, as it relates to linearity, we did see a nice quarter-on-quarter pickup in Q2 which was really driven by the factors that George discussed. And looking at the midpoint of guidance for the year, we do expect it to be relatively consistent with the numbers we like to talk about, which is the 48% in the first half and 52% in the second. Again, keep in mind that the good bit of our revenue, thankfully, comes from support, very predictable. Hopefully, we can do a little better, but the midpoint of guidance is pretty much right on linearity.', 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.', 'Wamsi Mohan', ""I was wondering, George, if you could comment a little bit on the public cloud revenue trajectory in fiscal '24 given some of the changes that you noted. And given those changes in cloud ops, how does that change your long-term revenue outlook for that business on a relative basis? I think before, you were thinking 40% of total public cloud. Wondering where you're thinking that, that might shake out now in the long term."", 'George Kurian', ""So let me provide some baseline before I jump into the strategy review takeaways and the implications. First, cloud is roughly 10% of total revenue. Subscription is 23% of cloud revenue, down about 35% a year ago. So it's a small percentage of the total cloud revenue and an even smaller percentage of the total company revenue. The mix of cloud storage and cloud ops is still relatively consistent, approximately 60-40. We focus our strategy review on all elements of our cloud portfolio and have 5 key takeaways that I outlined in my prepared comments. Sharpening the focus on first-party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services, these performed very well in the second quarter and continue to be uniquely differentiated both to end customers of our on-premises solution and a vehicle to acquire net new customers alongside our cloud partners. We would carefully manage the transition of some of the storage subscriptions to our consumption offering. As we roll out [1T] services, customers that used to buy storage subscriptions prefer to now go towards the 1T offering, and we'll manage that carefully. We will integrate some stand-alone services like data protection and privacy into our cloud storage offerings so that they bring more value to the base offering. And we'll refocus other services like Cloud Insights, which are subscription services, and Instaclustr to differentiate NetApp in the cloud storage workload motions that we are focused on. We've decided to exit some stand-alone services like Virtual Desktop and SaaS Backup services. And all of this will lead to about a $55 million ARR headwind from these actions in the second half of fiscal year '24. The reduction in public cloud subscription services will be partially offset by the good growth of our consumption cloud storage services in particular. And so our plans for the second half of the year assumes that we will have a modest decline in cloud revenue. We're not going to guide it but we assume that. And we have built that into the guidance for the fiscal year '24, which we took up by approximately $100 million. We're not going to comment today on the outlook for the overall cloud business. We will talk to you when we update our long-term models to that effect."", 'Wamsi Mohan', ""Okay. And if I could, Mike, your margins were really, really strong, both sequentially and on an absolute basis. Wondering, as we think about free cash flow margins, would all this EBIT margin improvement flow through into free cash flow margins? And secondarily, just on the EBIT margins, is there a way to dimension out of the three things that you noted, maybe rank order or order of magnitude, so that we can get some sense around the confidence of sustainability, especially as it relates to commodity pricing, which you seem to indicate won't really matter too much sequentially, but just wondering what was the biggest sequential driver of that margin improvement."", 'Michael J. Berry', ""Sure. So Wamsi, two questions there. First of all, on cash flow, and I'll do operating cash flow. We do expect for the year, I talked about it in the prepared remarks, operating cash flow to move relatively consistently with non-GAAP net income. So to your question, yes, as the income increases, so should operating cash flow, short of any quarterly fluctuations in working capital. So all good there in terms of free cash flow margins largely moving with operating cash flow. And then on the second question, and I'll answer this on a sequential basis, not a year-over-year basis. As we look from Q1 to Q2, certainly, the mix shift was a significant impact. We did receive some benefit on costs as those older inventories are now completely gone. And then, of course, pricing discipline is in there as well. So I would rank, from a sequential perspective, the order that I did in my prepared remarks in terms of mix shift, which is both product and capacity, then favorable COGS and then pricing discipline. So hopefully, that helps."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets.', 'Nehal Sushil Chokshi', ""You guys mentioned 30% growth in first-party storage services. What's the NRR underlying that?"", 'George Kurian', ""We don't break those out. I think we feel very good about we have brought in the number of workloads that we serve. We have brought in the number of hyperscalers now with Google coming online. We have brought lower price points for Azure and Google, and we have brought higher price points for Amazon. So I feel really, really good about the momentum in our first-party cloud storage services."", 'Nehal Sushil Chokshi', 'Maybe phrasing it in a different way, the driver of that growth is expansion or lands?', 'George Kurian', 'The combination of both new customer adds and add new workload use cases within existing customers as well as expansions.', 'Nehal Sushil Chokshi', 'Great. And then a follow-up quick question. George, you talked about how you had a $16 million win with a C-Series. And you mentioned 4 drivers behind that. Which of those 4 drivers was really probably the biggest element of that win?', 'George Kurian', 'Listen, I think we have a really strong operating system capability for performance and simplification at scale. Many of the other vendors that start simple run into real trouble when you try to build a large enterprise environment. And we have a really good portfolio to do that. I think that was probably the #1 reason. And the #2 reason is now that we have the C-Series, we have a price point to deliver to customers who used to not have it.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.', 'Simon Matthew Leopold', ""First, just a quick clarification. On the strategic review update, I just want to confirm, it sounds like you've concluded that review apart from sort of regular business kind of reviews. I just want to confirm that that's the case. And then really, the element I'm trying to sort of tease out here is you've taken out $55 million of ARR, so roughly $15 million of revenue, yet your outlook is higher. What is informing the higher outlook? What's been the biggest surprise and the biggest delta contributing to the higher outlook?"", 'George Kurian', ""So first of all, let me hit that in three parts, right? First, we have concluded the strategic review. We have a set of good decisions we've made that we need to now go implement that will result in a more focused cloud business and a healthier subscription base, albeit a smaller one to build off of. We believe that these actions should allow us to get back to growth in fiscal year '25 off a healthier business mix in cloud. We always will do reviews of various aspects of our portfolio as ongoing parts of our business. But the focused strategic review, I would say, is mostly complete. I think the second is with regard to the confidence we have, listen, we said that when we guided the second half of the year, we took up the overall guide by close to $100 million. That is mostly based on the momentum of our all-flash hybrid cloud storage portfolio. We've raised the second half guide by substantially more than we beat in the second quarter. And it also accounts for the fact that we will have some headwinds through the rest of fiscal year '24 in our cloud subscription business, which will only be partially offset by growth in our cloud consumption business."", 'Operator', 'And our next question then comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.', 'Aaron Christopher Rakers', ""A lot of those have been asked and answered, but I wanted to go back to some prior discussion around this notion of AI. And we hear a lot about like AI, large language models becoming smaller and implemented more maybe pervasively over time in traditional enterprise environments. We've even heard more about inferencing and how that might evolve in enterprises. I'm just curious, are you seeing at all any signs of that pulling, either discussions or early signs, of demand? And if so, is it a prerequisite that, that has to pull all-flash storage with that kind of footprint? And the reason I ask is there's a lot of discussion about a lot of this existing infrastructure that's going to have to be upgraded to support these acceleration of AI in infrastructure. Sorry for the long-winded question."", 'George Kurian', ""Yes. No problem. I'll address that in three steps. I think first is the use of smaller models as opposed to the very, very large model, yes, that term is distillation. We do see that going on in customers whereas they kind of run these different models, they begin to realize that you can get as effective an outcome with much faster results and a smaller number of parameters. For example, the demonstration, the live demonstration, that we showed at NetApp INSIGHT actually was the distillation. We started with a much larger LLM and we brought it to a much smaller range of parameters because you get the same benefit. So that's going on. The second is with regard to training environment, which is the part of the data life cycle in AI, when you aggregate a data set and you train the algorithm or the language model for better answers to be able to either predict a good outcome or generate a relevant outcome, you do need very high performance storage because the GPUs that drive those algorithms need very, very fast parallel access to data. And with our unstructured data scale-out file system, we feel very well positioned for that. And then the third is with regard to inferencing, Inferencing is the part of the data life cycle where you've taken a model and now you want to put it into production on our data set, could be on a factory floor, could be in a distributed office. There, it really depends on the data set and the use case what type of storage you need. You may need it for larger environments like shop floors, but you may not need super-high performance storage and compute for a very small office, like a claims office, for example, in insurance."", 'Aaron Christopher Rakers', ""That's very helpful. And as a quick follow-up real quickly, who is your predominant competitor that you see on the block-optimized C-level all-flash arrays or C-Series arrays?"", 'George Kurian', 'The block market is a crowded market. We feel very good about our offerings in the mid-range especially and the ability to offer a single solution with common automation, common administration, common life cycle management for both files and block. And no other vendor in the market can do that. And so we feel very good. I think the large competitors are clearly Dell and HPE are in the midrange and then you occasionally see some [pures].', 'Operator', 'Our next question today comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.', 'Samik Chatterjee', ""I guess if I start with the public cloud strategic review that you discussed, just wanted to clarify, based on the changes you're making there, are there any cost implications, other changes? I'm assuming that allows you to focus your go-to-market a bit more, but is there any sort of cost implication where you're enabling some cost take out there? And secondly, Mike, you mentioned sort of the 58% to 60% gross margin on the product revenue in the second half. When we think about sort of prebuys that you might do going into fiscal '25, how should we think about the trajectory of the gross margin into fiscal '25. Any levers that you have to offset sort of the flow-through of that to the operating margin that you're really reporting at a very strong level right now?"", 'George Kurian', ""On the cost side, listen, I think we will, for the most part, just repurpose those resources to drive growth in our first-party cloud storage. We feel good about the demand environment there, and we want to continue to accelerate that. Whatever cost opportunities they are, it's been factored into the second half guidance that we gave you."", 'Michael J. Berry', ""Okay. Thanks for the question, Samik. On the question, especially going into fiscal '25 from a product margin, I'll go over a little bit of my answer to Meta when she asked the same question. So as we've all seen from the analyst reports, we do expect that NAND has largely bottomed. We're at the loss component pricing we've been at in a while. We did a really nice job, again, kudos to the supply chain team for doing the prebuys and purchase agreements for '24. We will certainly look at those and continue to look at those in '25, but it has to make sense for both NetApp and our suppliers. So as we go into '21, there are certainly some levers. The big question there, Samik, that I don't have an answer to is what does the market do and pricing do over the next 6 months. That's why we're going to wait. We will guide the margin number when we guide for the full year because we really want to get through the next couple of quarters to see how component pricing goes, what we expect the mix to be and then what happens from a pricing environment perspective."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.', 'Ananda Prosad Baruah', 'I guess, George, an inference-related question, maybe two quick parts. Are you hearing any of your customers talk about legislation around inferencing having an impact on their plans? And I guess, just generally speaking, any opinion you have on sort of what that ramp over what time period kind of looks like, even if just anecdotally would be helpful. I appreciate it.', 'George Kurian', ""Yes. I think, first of all, we are in the early stages of generative AI. Predictive AI is quite mature and has very strong use cases. We have done really well in health care and life sciences, in manufacturing, in financial services, lots of use cases, right? And so I think that's mature. It requires good data sets and good data management to make it have the right outcome. With generative AI, there is obviously a lot of discussion on both regulation as well as judicious use of the technology, everything from fairness to ethics, to privacy, to all kinds, cybersecurity, all of those things. And I think it will take time. Where we are with most clients today is proof of concepts, right? They are trying to put their data sets together. They are trying to learn what these models will help them do. And there are some use cases which are really easy to see the benefits from software development. It's very easy to see the benefits from the more advanced ones where some of these concerns exist that we're seeing customers move cautiously, so it will take time. These are multiyear use case developments. And so we feel good about where we are at the moment, and we're just realistic that will take time to build momentum."", 'Operator', 'And our final question today comes from Shek Ho with Deutsche Bank.', 'Shek Ming Ho', 'I apologize if you have already addressed this. On the macro level, are you seeing any major differences between demand from large enterprises, small, medium businesses and federal. Any particular verticals you would point out that shows particular strength of weakness both on the hybrid cloud and the public cloud businesses?', 'George Kurian', 'The demand picture is still soft and mixed. Overall, we saw some improvements in the U.S., offset by some weakness in Europe. Nothing that is not in the public domain. With regard to the customer time, large enterprise is still soft. Tech, for example, tech and service provider spending has not really come back. It is really a customer-by-customer situation versus a broad industry situation. With regard to the demand picture in midsized enterprise, our mid-sized enterprise business performed more robustly and secularly better than our large enterprise business. Public sector continues to be a work in progress. We saw some of the impacts of the budget negotiations result in softer budgets for certain agencies. Our business performed well, particularly in the civilian agencies.', 'Kris Newton', ""Thank you, Sidney. I'm going to hand it back to George for some final comments."", 'George Kurian', ""In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their strong execution and operational discipline in Q2, which drove revenue above the midpoint of our guidance and record gross margin, operating margin and EPS. Only NetApp delivers an entire architecture of unified data storage solutions, helping customers operate with seamless flexibility to deploy new applications, unifying their data for AI and simplify data protection in a world of limited IT resources, rapid data growth and increased cybersecurity threats. Innovation in our all-flash storage portfolio enables us to address a broader TAM and we continue to innovate and lead in public cloud storage services. Our go-to-market team is laser-focused on these positions of strength, enabling us to deliver strong results in the challenged macro landscape. Looking ahead, I'm confident that the momentum we saw in Q2 will continue through the remainder of fiscal year '24. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""Thank you.

The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on PPL’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' See our latest analysis for PPL ', 'According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 33%, trading at US$26.24 compared to my intrinsic value of $19.68. This means that the opportunity to buy PPL at a good price has disappeared! In addition to this, it seems like PPL’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.', ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. PPL's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 79%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in PPL’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe PPL should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on PPL for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for PPL, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.Productivity and Business Processes revenues rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Continued strength in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user were key growth drivers.However, Office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind as customers shift to cloud offerings. Steady growth in Dynamics products and cloud services aided LinkedIn revenues.

Scientists have said carbon removal is needed to keep climate goals alive."", 'That approach has the backing of global producers seeking to continue profiting from fossil fuels, but draws skepticism among environmentalists and some governments who see it as a ploy to prolong the lifespan of oil and gas and who are pushing for tough language at COP28 to phase out fossil fuels completely.', 'Underscoring the rift, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said last week that the oil and gas industry is over-relying on carbon capture to reduce emissions and called the approach ""an illusion,"" sparking an angry response from OPEC which views the technology as a lifeline for future fossil fuel use.', '“We think that no amount of direct air capture as an industry should be used as any justification for prolonging of expanded fossil fuel production,” said Vikrum Aiyer, head of climate policy at Heirloom, which is a partner in the Louisiana facility called Project Cypress.', 'The differing approaches also reflect an important financial dynamic in the carbon removal industry: In the near term, it is a lot easier to make money trapping carbon if it comes with a perk like higher oil production.', 'Otherwise, the enormous price tag for world-scale carbon removal would need to fall to governments if there is any chance of these projects surviving.', 'SAVIOR OR FIG LEAF?', 'The IEA says DAC would have to capture as much as 1 billion metric tons annually by 2050 if the world is to hit its decarbonization targets, a massive scale-up from the 10,000 metric tons it removes currently.', 'A major concern is that DAC technology is both expensive and unproven at scale. Capturing carbon using DAC costs somewhere between $600 and $1,000 for each metric ton, mainly because of the huge amount of energy required to run the equipment.', ""There are two commercial DAC facilities now in operation – a Climeworks project in Iceland that can capture just 4,000 metric tons of CO2 a year and Heirloom's project in California that can capture 1,000 metric tons annually, with the rest of the emissions removed by DAC attributed to small pilot projects."", 'More than 100 other DAC projects are at various stages of development, but it is unclear how many will be completed or when, or how they would survive financially.', 'More mature carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which traps emissions at a point source like a smokestack, also requires a rapid scale up to make a difference. There are 41 operational commercial CCS projects worldwide with the capacity to store 49 million metric tons annually, according to the Global CCS Institute - about one-thousandth of the world’s total energy and industry-related CO2 emissions.', 'Most of those use the carbon for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or are linked to ethanol plants seeking to generate low carbon credits, according to the institute.', 'Incoming COP President Sultan al-Jaber has said that the technology to capture or remove carbon is needed in “any realistic scenario” to meet the world’s climate goals. The UAE’s national oil company ADNOC recently teamed up with Occidental to evaluate investment in DAC plants and CO2 sequestration hubs in the U.S. and the UAE.', ""'LICENSE TO CONTINUE'"", 'Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub has said DAC could give the oil industry “license to continue to operate for the next 60, 70, 80 years.”', 'The company says its Stratos project in Texas would use removed carbon to recover oil, or otherwise to generate carbon credits for storing carbon to sell to hard-do-decarbonize industries and allow it to brand its oil as “net zero,” and the fuels refined from it as “low carbon.”', '“What we\'re saying is that there is a highly transparent, highly credible way of tackling the emissions from those barrels of oil,"" said Mike Avery, president of 1PointFive, an Occidental subsidiary developing its DAC projects.', '""You\'re not bringing on any more oil than the world needs. You\'re addressing the emissions from the oil that the world still needs.""', 'Occidental also has a separate DAC hub proposal in Texas that won half a billion dollars in federal grants. That project’s CO2 will be sequestered underground and have no link to oil and gas, the Department of Energy said.', ""In Louisiana, the proponents of Climeworks and Heirloom's Project Cypress want to make it clear that the technology should have no role in prolonging the future of fossil fuels, even if it means committing to more limited revenue sources than rivals like Occidental."", 'Their money will be made instead by marketing carbon removal credits to corporations not involved in fossil fuels that wish to offset unavoidable emissions, or to governments seeking to stay on track with climate targets.', '“If you use air capture to get more fuels out of the ground, you\'re taking away market potential for renewables,"" said Christoph Gebald, CEO of Climeworks.

We will be very competitive to treat these patients with a differentiated surgical LAA solution,” Karim Bandali, president of Medtronic’s cardiac surgery business, said in an emailed statement.', 'The left atrial appendage closure procedure seals the opening to the heart’s LAA to keep clots from entering the bloodstream and causing strokes in people with AFib.\xa0Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and Society of Thoracic Surgeons recommend that patients with AFib who are undergoing a related cardiac surgery procedure should have their LAA closed.', 'Medtronic said its new offering received 510(k) clearance from the FDA in August and is commercially available in the U.S. on a limited basis.\xa0The device is the only LAA clip that can be repositioned after deployment during a procedure, according to the company.', '“While we hope we don’t need to use it often, the Penditure clip is recapturable and redeployable should we ever want to reposition an already deployed clip, which is a nice safety feature,” Gorav Ailawadi, professor of cardiac surgery at the University of Michigan, said in a statement from Medtronic.', 'The medtech company plans to begin enrolling patients in a post-market study of the device in early 2024.\xa0The CLIP-IT study will be a single-arm, nonrandomized trial evaluating about 150 patients at 25 U.S. sites.', 'Correction: In a previous version of this article, a comment from Karim Bandali, president of Medtronic’s cardiac surgery business, incorrectly characterized the left atrial appendage procedure market.

The largest specialty beauty retailer in the U.S., offering more than 25,000 beauty products in more than 1,350 stores, has showcased robust momentum lately. Yet, the stock’s valuation is trading at some of the most attractive levels in recent history. Consequently, I am bullish on the stock.', 'The first factor supporting my favorable outlook in ULTA’s investment case is the company’s robust growth story, driven by three synergistic factors — Ulta’s store expansion, e-commerce focus, and loyalty program. Let’s dive in.', 'As a premier beauty products retailer, ULTA strategically expands its physical footprint, carefully selecting locations across diverse regions to reach an ever-widening customer base. The pace of this expansion is remarkable, soaring from 449 stores in 2011 to 1,074 in 2017 and reaching 1,362 by the end of this past July.', 'The second crucial element revolves around ULTA’s adept focus on bolstering sales through e-commerce. Recognizing the escalating significance of online retail, the company has made substantial investments in its e-commerce platform.', 'This move has propelled overall growth and empowered ULTA with targeted marketing campaigns, promotions, and exclusive online offerings. In turn, e-commerce sales have risen notably over the years. Notably, these are higher-margin sales versus retail sales, benefiting ULTA’s profitability.', 'The third and final pillar of ULTA’s growth narrative is its esteemed loyalty program, Ultamate Rewards. Currently boasting 40 million members, Ultamate Rewards provides the company with invaluable data and consumer insights, serving as a potent competitive advantage. To illustrate the program’s extensive success, a staggering 95% of ULTA’s total sales are attributed to Ultamate Rewards members.', 'ULTA’s growth trajectory, propelled by the harmonious synergy of these three key factors, continued to be once again evident in its most recent Fiscal Q2 results. Notably, net sales for the quarter rose by 10.1%, fueled by an 8% uptick in comparable sales, which includes both existing stores and e-commerce sales, coupled with a stellar showing from recently opened stores.', 'More specifically, transaction volumes saw a notable 9% uptick during the quarter, demonstrating robust consumer engagement, even in the face of a marginal 1% dip in average ticket size. Clearly, the subtle decrease in average units per transaction was more than offset by the positive impact of elevated average selling prices, underscoring the inherent inelasticity of the cosmetics industry—an aspect worth keeping in mind when we discuss the stock’s valuation.', 'The second compelling aspect of ULTA’s investment appeal in the current market climate lies in its healthy balance sheet. Unlike many businesses grappling with diminished profits due to rising interest expenses as a result of rising rates, ULTA stands insulated. Remarkably, the company boasts a debt-free balance sheet (when excluding lease obligations), contrasting sharply with its cash position of $388.6 million.', 'In fact, the company’s net interest income increased to $4.4 million compared to $0.1 million in Q2-2022 due to higher average interest rates on cash balances. This, in my view, serves as yet another compelling facet for investors to factor into their evaluation of ULTA’s investment potential.', 'Impressive growth and a strong balance sheet create a powerful combo. Yet, what truly seals the deal for me is the stock’s appealing valuation. It’s this winning trifecta that positions ULTA’s investment appeal as tailor-made for the current market conditions.', 'Specifically, due to ULTA’s strong growth year-to-date and its ongoing momentum, consensus EPS estimates from Wall Street point toward another all-time high EPS of $25.41 for Fiscal 2023. This implies a forward P/E of 16.3. On a next-12-month basis, ULTA’s forward P/E stands at an even lower 15.9x. This is one of the lowest multiples the stock has traded at in recent years.', 'With its dominant market position, strong double-digit revenue growth, robust balance sheet, and a clear path towards achieving yet another year of record-breaking performance, I find ULTA’s recent dip and discounted valuation to present a compelling investment opportunity for prospective investors.', 'Regarding Wall Street’s view on the stock, Ulta Beauty has sustained a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 12 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. At $518.00, the average\xa0ULTA stock forecast\xa0suggests 24.9% upside potential.', 'If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell ULTA stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\xa0Rupesh Parikh\xa0from Oppenheimer, with an average return of 36.7% per rating and a 73% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.', 'ULTA stock emerges as a compelling investment opportunity, combining robust growth, a sound balance sheet, and an enticing valuation.', 'The company’s strategic expansion, focus on e-commerce, and successful loyalty program underscore a compelling growth story. Furthermore, its debt-free balance sheet and substantial cash reserves come in handy in the current macroeconomic landscape. Wrapped up by its discounted valuation, ULTA offers an attractive proposition for investors seeking a blend of growth and stability in today’s dynamic market.', 'Disclosure']"

Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC) (2.0%) (-14%) shares fell in response to the company's second quarter earnings report, which indicated that U.S. automotive growth was slowing, and voiced concerns over a slowing industrial backdrop that will impact GPC's Industrial segment, which now comprises about 40% of revenues. AMETEK (NYSE:AME) (2.9%) (-9%) shares were weak in Q3 as the company has seen softer order trends and channel destocking in parts of Europe, while the pace of the company's traditional M&A engine has slowed with just one deal completed in the first half of 2023 for only $100 million. However, AMETEK's core North America region continues to experience robust growth in sales and orders, and CEO Dave Zapico has noted that the company's M&A funnel remains very robust.

To skip the detailed analysis of widow and orphan stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy.', 'Widow and orphan stocks are well-established blue-chip companies that pay out stable dividends, have low volatility, and grow steadily over time. These companies are most suitable for vulnerable investors with a low knowledge of the stock market, like retirees, widows, and orphans. The term was coined in the 1930s for stocks that are mature enough to weather economic turbulence. Widow and orphan stocks is an outdated term for low-volatility investments.', 'One of the most attractive features of widow and orphan stocks is that these companies have the ability to maintain their dividend payments during tough times. For example, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been increasing its dividend for the past 67 years, which means that the company was able to sustain itself through several recessions, including the Black Monday of 1987, The Great Financial Crisis, and the COVID-19 recessions along with the aftermath of Russia-Ukraine war.', 'While widow and orphan stocks might be considered safe investments, they still have their drawbacks. These companies have stable growth, but in a bull market, these stocks cannot take advantage of favorable market conditions like growth stocks due to their low volatility. This might not apply to a few companies on our list, such as Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), as these companies have recorded major profits and losses in the last few decades. However, these oil Supermajors have still maintained their dividends for decades despite heavy losses suffered in 2016 and 2020 as they are fundamentally strong.', 'The stock market has performed better than expected in 2023 as the S&P 500 is up over 19%, and the NASDAQ-100 is up 47.5% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of writing on November 28. Despite the strong performance due to the boom in the technology sector, some analysts still believe that a recession could hit the US economy in 2024. If we consider their prediction, investing in safe and stable companies like the widow and orphan stocks can safeguard investments. Widow and orphan stocks are also perfect investments for beginners with little knowledge of the stock market.', 'Some of the best widow and orphan stocks include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).

The average price target of $63.76 of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) represents an upside of 8.62% at the time of writing on November 28.', 'On October 30, Truist analyst Bill Chappell decreased the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $65 from $75 and maintained a Buy rating. The firm increased its FY23 EPS view by 6c to $2.67 and mentioned that there are still a few contractions affecting the beverages industry.', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58', 'Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is a famous American retail chain operator headquartered in Minnesota.', 'On November 15, Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) posted its Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $2.10, which beat the analysts’ estimates by $0.62.

(NYSE:NEE)’s stock to $75 from $90 while keeping a Buy rating. The analyst calls the company attractive based on it being a superb regulated utility and renewables developer.', 'Madison Investments commented on NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:', '“Although NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) reported an in-line second quarter, the stock has been weak primarily because of rising interest rates. NextEra also reported slower renewables backlog growth than expected.

T-Mobile (TMUS) has historically been a thorn in Verizon’s side but recently has become more disciplined on pricing. In fact, T-Mobile’s most recent unlimited data phone plan is more expensive than both AT&T’s (T) and Verizon’s.

Munger, known for his maxims about business, investing, and life, would sip Coca-Colas and nibble See's Candies peanut brittle alongside his partner."", 'Famously, he would often say, after Buffett finished speaking, ""I have nothing further to add.""', 'Charles Thomas Munger was born on Jan. 1, 1924, in Omaha, Neb. He grew up in the Dundee neighborhood, a half a block from Buffett’s house, and attended the same high school as the investing legend. He even worked at Buffett’s grandfather’s grocery store as a teenager, though the pair wouldn’t meet until later at the ages of 35 and 29, respectively. When they did finally meet, they became instant friends and partners.', 'At the age of 17, Munger enrolled in the University of Michigan to study mathematics only to drop out at the age of 19 during World War II to serve in the US Army Air Corps. While in the Army, he studied meteorology at Caltech in Pasadena, Calif., which became his home.', 'After the Army, Munger chose to study law, a ""natural course of activity"" for him given that his father was an attorney and his grandfather was a federal judge.', 'When Munger applied to Harvard Law School he was initially rejected. He applied again and received his J.D. from Harvard Law School, graduating magna cum laude in 1948. After law school, Munger returned to Los Angeles where he practiced real estate law.', 'After his father died in 1959, Munger returned to Omaha to sort out his affairs. While there, Munger ate lunch at the Omaha Club with friends who invited Buffett along. The lunch sparked an instant friendship and one of the most important business partnerships ever forged.', 'In 1962, Munger started an investment partnership. He also started a law firm, Munger Tolles, but stopped practicing law a few years later to focus on investing.', 'Buffett credited Munger for breaking his ""cigar-butt"" investing habit, a strategy the investor learned from Benjamin Graham of finding companies at bargain prices and getting ""free puffs"" out of them.', 'While that strategy worked well in Buffett’s early days of managing much smaller sums of money, Munger ""set the course for building a business that would combine huge satisfactory profits,"" according to an account of Berkshire’s history written by Buffett himself.', '“[Charlie’s] most important architectural feat was the design of today’s Berkshire. The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices,” Buffett wrote.', 'Buffett also learned the importance of knowing one’s circle of competence from Munger.', '""Ben Graham taught me a way to value certain type of business, but the selection of variable companies dried up. Charlie taught me about durable competitive advantage — not how big circle of competence is, but knowing where the edges are most important,"" Buffett said at the 2010 annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting.', 'Munger often spoke of the importance of understanding ""the edge"" of one\'s competence — in other words, knowing what you don’t know.', '“Well it’s a hugely important thing, knowing the edge. It’s hardly a competence if you don’t know the edge of it. You know, if you have a misapprehension regarding your own competency that means you lack competence, you’re going to make terrible mistakes. I think you’ve got to constantly measure what you achieve against other people of achievement, and you have to keep being determinedly rational, and avoiding a lot of self-delusion,” Munger said at the 2019 Daily Journal meeting.', 'In a 1985 shareholder letter, Buffett said Munger “has always emphasized the study of mistakes rather than successes, both in business and other aspects of life.”', 'Munger “does so in the spirit of the man who said: ‘All I want to know is where I’m going to die so I’ll never go there.’ You’ll immediately see why we make a good team: Charlie likes to study errors and I have generated ample material for him, particularly in our textile insurance businesses,” Buffett wrote.', 'To make better decisions in business and life, Munger often deployed what he called a “latticework” of mental models.', '“You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience — both vicarious and direct — on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head,” Munger said during a 1994 speech at USC’s business school.', 'One of those famed mental models is a phenomenon Munger coined the ""lollapalooza effect"" in a 1995 speech. At the 2018 Daily Journal meeting, Munger said he came up with the term after reading the main textbooks in introductory psychology and “of course, being Charlie Munger, I decided the psychologists were doing it all wrong and I could do it better.”', ""“One of the ideas I came up with, which wasn’t in any of the books, was that the 'lollapalooza effects' came when three or four of these tendencies were operating at once in the same situation. I can see that it wasn’t linear,” Munger said."", 'Munger was also passionate about architecture, a field in which he had no formal training. He developed luxury beachfront homes in Montecito, Calif., nicknamed ""Mungerville."" He also designed college dormitories and his own home.', '""I think a life properly lived is just learn, learn, learn all the time. I think Berkshire has gained enormously from these investment decisions by learning for a long period,"" Munger said at Berkshire\'s 2017 annual meeting.', 'Beyond the investment success, Buffett has repeatedly said that Munger made him “a better person.”', '“People find this hard to believe, but in 60 years, we’ve never had an argument. We have disagreed about things and we’ll probably keep occasionally disagreeing about this or that, but if you define an argument where emotion starts entering into it or anger or anything of the sort it just doesn’t, it doesn’t happen,"" Buffett said at the 2019 annual meeting.', 'Munger encountered his fair share of hardship in life. His first marriage to Nancy Huggins ended in divorce. A year later, his 8-year-old son died of leukemia. Munger also lost his eye after a botched cataract surgery.', 'Munger’s second marriage to Nancy Barry lasted 54 years until his wife’s death in 2010. When asked about relationship advice and finding a good spouse, Munger said, “The best single way is to deserve a good spouse.”', 'Munger often said the secret to a long and happy life is ""simple.""', '“You don’t have a lot of envy, you don’t have a lot of resentment, you don’t overspend your income. You stay cheerful in spite of your troubles. You deal with reliable people, and you do what you’re supposed to.

The 93 year-old Hungarian American is known as the philosopher investor in the Wall Street, mainly due to his contributions to philosophy and his deep desire to leave his mark in the world of philosophy, which many believe he fulfilled thanks to his General Theory of Reflexivity for capital markets.', 'George Soros in his book The New Paradigm of Financial Markets wrote a chapter titled “Autobiography of a Failed Philosopher” in which he talked in detail about how many, including his son and his biographer, started accepting the idea that Soros was a failed philosopher. \xa0Soros talks in detail about his childhood, his relationship with his father who at one point, according to Soros, lost all ambition in life and did not amass any wealth. A Jew by birth, Soros decided to come to the UK after the Nazi occupation of Hungary. Soros’ first interactions with philosophy started when he was impressed by the works of Karl Popper. But Soros’ dreams of creating a career in philosophy could not realize for several reasons, some of which he talks about in his book:', '“I would have preferred to stay within the safe walls of academe—I even had a teaching assistant job prospect at the University of Michigan in Kalamazoo, but my grades were not good enough, and I was forced to go out into the real world. After several false starts, I ended up working as an arbitrage trader, first in London and then in New York.* At first I had to forget everything I had learned as a student in order to hold down my job, but eventually my college education came in very useful. In particular, I could apply my theory of reflexivity to establish a disequilibrium scenario or boom-bust pattern for financial markets. The rewarding part came when markets entered what I called far-from-equilibrium territory because that is when the generally accepted equilibrium models broke down.”', 'At the end of the chapter Soros said he was able to come out of the period of self-doubt and finally achieved his goal of becoming a philosopher.', '""I am aware of the various shortcomings in my previous presentations, which I hope to have overcome, and I believe that it will be worth the reader’s while to make the effort required to understand my philosophy. Needless to say, this makes me very happy. I have been fortunate in making a lot of money and spending it well. But I have always wanted to be a philosopher, and finally I may have become one. What more can one ask for from one life?""', 'Whether or not Soros is a philosopher might still be up for debate but that he is an accomplished stock picker is a fact hardly questioned by any, including his naysayers. George Soros founded Soros Fund Management in 1970. Since its inception through 2010, the fund posted on average a 20% annual rate of return.

This is because stocks near that level are perceived to be winners. However, stocks touching a new 52-week high are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculations are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, investors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices.\xa0Stocks such as DaVita DVA, Brinker International EAT, CNA Financial CNA and Integer Holdings ITGR are expected to maintain their momentum and keep scaling new highs.\xa0 More information on a stock is necessary to understand whether or not there is scope for further upside.Here, we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The strategy borrows from the basics of momentum investing. This technique bets on “buy high, sell higher.”', 'Many times, stocks that hit a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.In fact, overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay a premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.', 'We ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring the continuation of their rally for some time.', 'This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.11 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.', 'It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.', 'This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.', 'The lower, the better.', 'This metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.', 'This helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.', 'No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since its inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.', 'This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $8 or higher.', ""The inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are four stocks of the 11 that made it through the screen:DaVita is a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States to patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease.

As of Sep 30, 2023, DaVita provided dialysis services to around 249,100 patients at 3,053 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,694 were U.S. centers while 359 were located across 11 other countries. DaVita has been opening and acquiring several dialysis centers, both within the United States and overseas, which is promising. A strong solvency position is an added plus.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DVA’s 2023 earnings has increased 9.2% to $8.07 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 36.55%.Brinker International owns, operates, develops and franchises various restaurants under Chili’s Grill & Bar (Chili’s) and Maggiano’s Little Italy (Maggiano’s) brands.

Also, focus on various sales-building and expansion initiatives bodes well. The company continues to focus on Chili’s international expansion through development agreements with new and existing franchise partners. Chili’s turnaround strategies yielded positive results, with traffic and sales moving in the positive direction. The company emphasizes the brand's new restaurant development to drive growth.

CNA Financial remains well-poised to gain from a rise in new businesses, strong rate, lower net catastrophe losses, improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results and higher net earned premium, which contribute to premium growth across its Specialty, Commercial and International segments.CNA Financial’s fixed-income investment strategy with the highest allocations to diversified investment grade corporates as well as highly rated municipal securities should support investment results in the near term. CNA has been able to maintain the underlying combined ratio below 95 for 13 straight quarters. Through targeted portfolio management strategies, the company made significant progress in successfully repositioning the portfolio underwritten via Lloyd’s syndicate in its effort to improve the overall underwriting results of its international operation.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CNA’s 2023 earnings has increased 2.8% to $4.41 per share in the past 30 days.

As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Trane Technologies PLC's dividend performance and assess its sustainability."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with KHC.', ""High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio"", 'This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years', 'How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?', 'Trane Technologies manufactures and services commercial and residential HVAC systems and transportation refrigeration solutions under its prominent Trane, American Standard, and Thermo King brands. The company, with a market cap of $16 billion, generates approximately 70% of sales from equipment and 30% from parts and services. Although domiciled in Ireland, North America is its largest market, accounting for over 70% of its revenue.', 'Trane Technologies PLC has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1986, with dividends currently distributed on a quarterly basis. Trane Technologies PLC has increased its dividend each year since 2010, earning the status of a dividend achievera title reserved for companies with a minimum of 13 consecutive years of dividend increases.', 'Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share to track historical trends.', ""As of today, Trane Technologies PLC has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.31% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 1.35%. This indicates an expected increase in dividend payments over the next year. Over the past three years, Trane Technologies PLC's annual dividend growth rate was 8.10%, which further increased to 8.40% over a five-year period. Impressively, the annual dividends per share growth rate over the past decade stands at 14.70%."", 'Based on the current dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost for Trane Technologies PLC stock is approximately 1.96%.', ""To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one must examine the company's payout ratio. Trane Technologies PLC's dividend payout ratio is currently 0.34, suggesting a healthy balance between paying dividends and retaining earnings for future growth. Additionally, the company's profitability rank of 9 out of 10, as of 2023-09-30, indicates strong earnings potential relative to peers. Trane Technologies PLC has also consistently reported positive net income over the past decade, reinforcing its financial stability."", ""Trane Technologies PLC's robust growth rank of 9 out of 10 bodes well for its future prospects. The company's revenue per share and 3-year revenue growth rate of 8.40% per year, outperform approximately 66.17% of global competitors, signaling a strong revenue model. The 3-year EPS growth rate of 17.40% per year and 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 8.80% further demonstrate Trane Technologies PLC's capability to grow earnings, which is vital for sustaining dividends over the long term."", ""In conclusion, Trane Technologies PLC's consistent dividend payments, robust dividend growth rate, prudent payout ratio, and solid profitability and growth metrics paint a promising picture for current and prospective investors. As the company continues to navigate the complexities of the HVAC and refrigeration industries, its financial health and commitment to shareholder returns suggest that it could remain a reliable choice for value investors focused on dividend income.

In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.3b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.2%) = US$44b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$44b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$21b', 'The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$34b.

You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ingersoll Rand as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.059. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

', ""If there's one thing that can be said with certainty, it's that the industrial segment is responsible for today's technological and civilizational advances. Whether it's mass produced consumer products such as toothpaste and deodorants, or airplanes and cars, industrial mass production has rapidly transformed humanity's standard of living in just a couple of decades."", ""In the 21st century, even though most investor and media attention is focused on lucrative technology companies, industrial firms remain at the center of global prosperity and advancements. For instance, one of the most well known industrial companies in the world is the American manufacturing giant General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). General Electric was set up in 1892 and it is responsible for making some of the most advanced technological products in the world. Two of General Electric's most important business divisions are the aerospace and energy businesses. The GE Aerospace business division is one of the few jet engine manufacturers in the world. Its products are used by big ticket firms such as The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and often prove to be indispensable when it comes to alternatives. Similarly, the GE Power division is one of the handful of power turbine companies in the world, and one that is also capable of manufacturing products for nuclear power plants."", ""Another big ticket industrial name is Boeing. Boeing is the only company apart from Airbus that makes commercial jets in the Western world, with some of its biggest products capable of flying hundreds of people all over the world. Additionally, Boeing is also one of the world's leading technology companies when it comes to aerospace and astronautics. Its aircraft such as the F-15EX fighter planes are among the most advanced in the world and are used by the world's leading military powers such as the U.S. Air Force. Similarly, Boeing is NASA's primary manufacturing partner for the space agency's Artemis program."", ""NASA Artemis plans to place humans on the Moon once again after the Apollo program, and the Boeing built Space Launch System (SLS) rocket successfully sent the Orion spacecraft to a lunar orbit last year as part of NASA's first Artemis test flight. The SLS is also the world's most powerful operational rocket, and it uses solid rocket boosters manufactured by the industrial company Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) and engines made by the L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) subsidiary Aerojet Rocketdyne."", ""Nuclear power, jet engines, and rockets are the leading demonstrators of humanity's 2023 technological advancements over people living just a century back. The fact that the industrial segment is responsible for making all these products ensures that this segment is indispensable to our progress. At the same time, the sector is also relatively insulated against competition.

Our next guest says there's opportunity in growth names outside of the tech sector. Joining us now, Jennifer Grancio, TCW Head of Global Wealth. Great to see you. Thanks so much for coming in."", ""And this is obviously a theme that we've talked a lot about this week, that the Mega Cap tech stocks have just been dominating. But your bag is sort of looking outside of that, at other things here. So I guess, first of all, tell us your methodology and why you want to look outside of that Mega Cap growth."", ""JENNIFER GRANCIO: Yeah, thank you. I would be happy to do that. And if you think about it, everybody is so invested, and everybody's portfolio is so invested in tech and growth at this point. We think that it's always hard to time the markets and you can't be in-- you can't be in cash vehicles forever."", ""And so when you look at the equity portfolio, we're seeing huge, huge transformations in the market. So we're seeing a transformation around energy, which is sources of powers, but also efficiency. So planes are getting more efficient. If somebody can manufacture a plane that's more efficient, they have huge pricing power and they have huge kind of opportunity to drive up the stock price."", ""And so we run a range of strategies that are looking at helping people make money outside of that core tech portfolio, particularly as we look at one transformation of how we use energy and power, and two, reshoring, and this huge boom we're having in manufacturing in the US."", ""- And commercial aerospace, that's one area. Explain that thesis to us."", ""JENNIFER GRANCIO: Yeah, absolutely. And so if we think about how much we've invested or haven't invested frankly, in the last decade and in certain areas, commercial aerospace is one of those areas. So two investment opportunities. One, the planes we have up in the air today need a huge amount of maintenance. I think we've had 3 million people traveling just on Sunday. Highest travel day ever was this past Sunday."", ""So air travel is coming back. The planes need to be serviced. So a huge opportunity in names like GE that are actually manufacturing and repairing. And then if we look forward, there's a demand from consumers for efficiency. So new planes, Airbus in new planes use 20% less fuel, which is a huge savings and a huge edge therefore, for companies that are buying the Airbus plane. So that's one of the themes that plays out in our portfolios."", '- Whenever we talk Airbus, I got to ask about Boeing too. So implied then is the idea perhaps that Airbus is doing a better job at this than is Boeing?', ""JENNIFER GRANCIO: That's our thesis."", '- OK. And just because that they are looking more to the future of having these more efficient planes.', ""JENNIFER GRANCIO: The future, and also how they run their business. So you know, Airbus is a business we think is very well run. We're active managers, so we run net Z is one tick, or SAP is the other. They're very concentrated portfolios. And so we've known these management teams for a long time. In some cases, like in the waste management space, we own a couple of names. In the case of aerospace, we think Airbus is the one to hold."", '- And what could-- Jennifer, what could then Boeing be doing differently?', ""JENNIFER GRANCIO: I think it's a combination of how they run their business historically and how capable they are in terms of delivering in a reliable way from a forecasting perspective so that we can see that stock grow.""]"

To skip our detailed analysis of the global healthcare industry in 2023, go directly and see Top 10 Leading Causes Of Death In The World.', 'Enormous disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which was also one of the leading causes of death in the world in 2020, coupled with a variety of social, economic, geopolitical and environmental volatility, continues to exert substantial pressure on global healthcare as the industry enter 2024. However, the past few years have also made way for huge advancements in terms of innovation in the way healthcare systems operate. According to a report by the World Economic Forum, it is imperative to ensure stakeholders, industries, and countries make integrated pathways to achieve commo healthcare goals, curating collaborative avenues in doing so. The report estimates that global healthcare was valued at around $12 trillion as of 2022, up from $8.5 trillion in 2018. Healthcare investments peaked to record highs in 2021 owing to the pandemic and other supply chain disruptions, the tailwinds of which the industry is still riding today. Following the launch of mRNA based vaccines, applications are rapidly growing beyond infectious diseases in Zika, malaria and other leading causes of death in the world. Digital investments in healthcare nearly doubled to $57 billion in 2022, and with the rapid growth of digital health startups, the expansion of technology companies into the healthcare market is exerting further pressure on the overall industry.', 'One of the major concerns top players in the healthcare market like UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) are facing are gross labor shortages, primarily due to a surge in early retirements post the pandemic. This new shift in the labor pool puts enormous pressure on hospitals and healthcare providers, especially since skilled medical professionals are critical in processing and carrying out exorbitant amounts of medical and surgical procedures to deal with some of the leading causes of death in the world. According to a report by BlackRock, 1 in 5 healthcare workers in the US have quit their jobs since the onset of the pandemic. 2 out of 3 of those who have quit decided to forego the industry entirely and set up shop elsewhere. This is an enormous dent to the healthcare industry as staffing challenges are having adverse impacts on the production, development and distribution of medical devices and supplies. The declining number of medical professionals available to use advanced medical devices for surgical procedures and other complex medical care have resulted in a depreciation of demand for more advanced product lines. Although the report predicts that the current labor crisis has reached its peak and will settle in the coming years, healthcare companies like UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) will be needing to look out for opportunities and areas of potential to gain strategic advantages over their competitors in an already tight market environment. You can read more on the potential challenges facing the global healthcare industry as it heads into 2024 in our coverage of the 20 Countries With the Most Centenarians.', 'According to a report by McKinsey, the concept of consumer centricity is garnering increasing traction in nearly all consumer-facing industries, with healthcare being no exception. In this vein, top players in the industry like UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) are confronting an imperative of catering to skyrocketing demand and shifting consumer preferences across the end-to-end healthcare journey, in addition to feeling the need to mirror the experiences consumers most enjoy about interacting with other companies. According to research by McKinsey, consumers express greater satisfaction with respect to healthcare they received in the past and have exhibited increasing frustration over the state of the industry today. Healthcare companies are struggling to adopt more consumer-centric practices to try to change this perception owing to core industry dynamics and a swiftly transforming care and coverage landscape.', 'According to the article, addressing the dynamic nature of consumer expectations and preferences is an incredibly challenging task in that it demand reimagining traditional healthcare journey offerings. To shift current perceptions, healthcare providers could target a future with a dramatically healthier population, with more affordable healthcare, and timely access to the kind of care they require. Healthcare companies like UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) are already diverting increased investments in improving performance through a more affordable product and service lineup, higher-quality care and experiences, an increase in the number of consumers catered to, and more encouraging and incentivizing more consumer loyalty to their improved brands. Furthermore, these companies are making additional efforts to identify customer pain points to unlock improved outcomes, especially with respect to the leading causes of death in the world. According to the report, consumers who are satisfied with their healthcare providers report deferring care more than 10% less, seek out routine care 14% more, and opt for inpatient care options 13% less than unsatisfied customers. Additionally, consumers who have higher levels of engagement tend to persist with their current insurer and provider.', ""Certain companies have been able to deliver distinctive and innovative solutions at scale which cater to the dynamic nature of consumer preferences better and drive additional value for the health system at large. One such area where companies are investing is in transparent healthcare billing. Nearly all consumers point to the payment experience as one of the most important factors in deciding which healthcare provider to opt for or persist with. Industry innovators have built on the billing journey by prioritizing cost transparency throughout the healthcare experience and by integrating a payer-provider dynamic to encourage a seamless and personalized payment process. One industry leader reported an 88% patient satisfaction and a 30% average lift in patient payments after incorporating the aforementioned mechanisms into their daily operations. Companies like UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) have begun to divert greater investments in delivering customized, at-home care plans via digital pathways to improve upon consumer empowerment and enhance engagement. In a case study conducted by JF Bailey in 2020, more than 75% of consumers enrolled in a company's comprehensive musculoskeletal digital care program experienced considerable reductions in pain and a more seamless healthcare experience.

It reported NAREIT funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.02, surpassing both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the prior-year quarter’s figure of $1.01. The performance was backed by healthy leasing activity and a year-over-year improvement in the base rent.For 2023, management revised its NAREIT FFO per share guidance to the range of $4.13-$4.15 from $4.11-$4.15 estimated earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is presently pegged at $4.15, within expectations."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', ""Let us now decipher the factors behind the surge in the stock price and check whether this trend will last.Regency’s high-quality open-air shopping centers are situated in affluent suburban areas and near the urban trade areas where consumers have high spending power. With the continuation of the post-pandemic migration trend and the hybrid work setup, demand for Regency’s suburban shopping center portfolio remains robust, aiding leasing activity and occupancy levels.In the nine months ended Sep 30, 2023, Regency executed 1,310 new and renewal leases representing 4.8 million of pro-rata square feet with positive rent spreads of 9.2%. The same-property portfolio was 95.4% leased as of Sep 30, 2023, reflecting an expansion of 20 basis points (bps) sequentially and 70 bps year over year.The retail REIT’s focus on necessity, service, convenience and value retailers serving the essential needs of the communities provides it with an unequaled strategic advantage. Its portfolio comprises more than 80% of the grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers, which are necessity-driven by nature. This ensures dependable traffic and allows the company to bank on its grocery centers during uncertain times.Also, the company enjoys a good tenant mix with several industry-leading grocers, assuring stable revenues for the company. As of Sep 30, 2023, grocery tenants accounted for 20% of its annual base rent.The company continues to make concerted efforts to improve its portfolio quality and enhance its market presence via strategic acquisitions and developments in key markets of the United States.In August 2023, it closed the buyout of Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc. in an all-stock transaction. This created a combined company with a total equity market capitalization of more than $11 billion and an enterprise value of more than $16 billion.With the combined portfolio comprising 480 properties and encompassing more than 56 million square feet of gross leasable area, the move enhances Regency's geographic diversification, tenant mix, growth prospects and balance sheet strength. The acquisition was said to be immediately accretive to its core operating earnings.Moreover, Regency has an encouraging development pipeline which augurs well for its long-term growth. As of Sep 30, 2023, the company’s in-process development and redevelopment projects estimated net project costs of around $440 million at the company’s share. Management anticipates incurring $130 million of development and redevelopment spend for 2023.On the balance sheet front, Regency had around $1.2 billion of immediate liquidity as of Sep 30, 2023. Its pro-rata net debt-to-operating EBITDAre ratio was 5.5 while the fixed charge coverage ratio was 4.7 as of the same date. It has no unsecured debt maturities until June 2024.Also, its investment grade credit ratings of BBB+ (Stable Outlook) and Baa1 (Positive Outlook) S&P Global and Moody's, respectively, render it favorable access to the debt market. The company’s strong financial footing is likely to support its growth endeavors going forward.In addition, REG’s current cash flow growth is projected at 21.54% compared with the 14.92% estimated for the industry.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors, and Regency remains committed to that. This month, concurrent with its third-quarter earnings release, the company’s announced a 3.1% sequential increase in its quarterly cash dividend payment on its common stock to 67 cents. Moreover, in the last five years, the retail REIT increased its dividend five times. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock. Check Regency Centers’ dividend history here.Given its solid operating platform and decent financial position compared to that of the industry, we expect this dividend rate to be sustainable over the long run.Nonetheless, rising e-commerce adoption and the efforts of online retailers to go deeper into the grocery business raise concerns for Regency Centers. Online retailing is likely to remain a popular choice among customers, negatively impacting the market share of brick-and-mortar stores. This may hurt the demand for the company’s properties and limit top-line growth.Also, given a high interest rate environment, the company may find it difficult to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds as the costs are likely to be on the higher side."", 'Some better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are TANGER INC SKT and Urban Edge Properties UE.

This translates to selling battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) from 2035 onwards.

Widow and orphan stocks is an outdated term for low-volatility investments.', 'One of the most attractive features of widow and orphan stocks is that these companies have the ability to maintain their dividend payments during tough times. For example, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been increasing its dividend for the past 67 years, which means that the company was able to sustain itself through several recessions, including the Black Monday of 1987, The Great Financial Crisis, and the COVID-19 recessions along with the aftermath of Russia-Ukraine war.', 'While widow and orphan stocks might be considered safe investments, they still have their drawbacks. These companies have stable growth, but in a bull market, these stocks cannot take advantage of favorable market conditions like growth stocks due to their low volatility. This might not apply to a few companies on our list, such as Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), as these companies have recorded major profits and losses in the last few decades. However, these oil Supermajors have still maintained their dividends for decades despite heavy losses suffered in 2016 and 2020 as they are fundamentally strong.', 'The stock market has performed better than expected in 2023 as the S&P 500 is up over 19%, and the NASDAQ-100 is up 47.5% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of writing on November 28. Despite the strong performance due to the boom in the technology sector, some analysts still believe that a recession could hit the US economy in 2024. If we consider their prediction, investing in safe and stable companies like the widow and orphan stocks can safeguard investments. Widow and orphan stocks are also perfect investments for beginners with little knowledge of the stock market.', 'Some of the best widow and orphan stocks include Walmart Inc.

Project Roadrunner will convert waste carbon dioxide (CO2) and renewable power into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other low-carbon fuels. This first-of-a-kind commercial-scale Power-to-Liquids (PtL) eFuels facility is expected to be the largest PtL eFuels project in North America once operational. Breakthrough Energy Catalyst funds and invests in first-of-a-kind projects that support the deployment of emerging climate technologies to reduce emissions and accelerate the clean energy transition. This commitment represents Catalyst’s first equity investment to date.', 'Project Roadrunner, located in West Texas, will convert an existing brownfield gas-to-liquids project into a fully integrated eFuels facility that will deliver products into both U.S. and international markets. It will primarily produce Infinium eSAF, a sustainable aviation fuel with the potential to significantly reduce the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated with air travel. PtL SAF is expected to reduce lifecycle GHG emissions in aviation by around 90 percent, which is higher than the emissions reductions achieved using SAF on the market today. Project Roadrunner will also produce Infinium eNaphtha for use in plastics manufacturing and Infinium eDiesel for use in hard-to-electrify transportation methods, such as long-haul trucking and maritime applications.', 'In tandem with Catalyst’s investment in Infinium, American Airlines and Infinium have entered into an innovative, firm offtake agreement for Infinium eSAF. This agreement is a critical enabler of further investment in Project Roadrunner. American joined Breakthrough Energy Catalyst as an anchor partner to accelerate the development of next-generation clean energy technologies, including SAF. The Catalyst team worked to develop the agreement alongside the American and Infinium teams. The agreement provides one model for how airlines can use offtake agreements to help promising new SAF technologies attract investment dollars.', 'In further support of this offtake agreement, Citi and American Airlines have separately agreed to transfer\xa0the\xa0associated emission reductions to Citi to support the scaling of this innovative technology\xa0and\xa0help reduce a portion of Citi’s Scope 3 emissions from employee travel. Citi is also a partner of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst.', 'Infinium has numerous eFuels projects in development across the U.S., Europe, Middle East, Japan and Australia.', '“The investment from Catalyst is critical to accelerating the completion of Project Roadrunner and to the delivery of significant volumes of eFuels created from waste carbon dioxide and renewable power. Importantly, this project will serve as a template for other, larger eFuels plants under development,” said Robert Schuetzle, CEO at Infinium. “The groundbreaking commercial agreement with American is an important prototype for the aviation industry as its firm offtake agreement supports project financing, providing revenue certainty for the project.”', '“This project is a landmark achievement for the development of sustainable aviation fuels and the offtake agreement provides a model for the entire aviation industry of one way to effect change and support the scale-up of capital-intensive projects,” said Mario Fernandez, Head of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. “Infinium’s technological and commercial maturity, coupled with the company’s project development expertise, will help accelerate the clean energy transition by quickly bringing to market clean fuels for aviation, trucking, and other long-distance parts of the transportation sector. American’s creativity, commitment and collaboration with Citi, have set a new marker, demonstrating what it takes to usher in a climate-friendly aviation future.”', '“American joined Breakthrough Energy Catalyst because we saw the potential to accelerate the commercialization of the clean energy technologies of the future. Today, we see the realization of that potential in Catalyst’s investment in Infinium’s electrofuels SAF, coupled with American’s long-term commitment to purchase those fuels,” said Jill Blickstein, American’s Chief Sustainability Officer. “Our partnership with Catalyst – and our new commitment with Infinium – exemplifies the novel collaboration necessary to bring to market the new technologies that will allow us to decarbonize.”', '“Citi is proud to work with Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, American Airlines and Infinium in this effort to support the commercialization of sustainable aviation fuel,"" said Val Smith, Citi\'s Chief Sustainability Officer. ""Infinium\'s eSAF technology is the latest example of innovation and growth in the climate solutions space. We hope the offtake arrangement with American, where we combine their direct use of SAF with our indirect use through our business travel, will serve as one model for how offtake agreements can be used to help scale up future solutions for low-emissions air travel.”', 'About InfiniumInfinium is an electrofuels provider on a mission to decarbonize the world.

This is especially true for small countries and islands like Macau, Maldives and Seychelles, which while not among the most popular places in the world, are counted among places where tourism contributes over 50% of the country's total GDP. Globally, tourism accounts for 10% of the total GDP resulting in more than 320 million jobs."", 'However, the most popular countries in the world in 2023 suffered massively during the Covid-19 pandemic, as travel was suspended both internationally and domestically, and the number of tourists unsurprisingly plummeted. According to the International Monetary Fund, over 1.5 billion took trips in 2019, just before the pandemic struck, and according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization, the impact of the pandemic was devastating to say the least. This was particularly relevant for some of the most popular countries globally, most of which rely heavily on tourism. In 2019, 2.88 billion nights were spent by tourists while in 2020, this decreased by more than 50% to just 1.42 billion in 2020 and only increased slightly to 1.83 billion in 2021.', 'benemale/Shutterstock.com', 'Fortunately, in 2023, the tourism industry seems to be almost fully recovered from the pandemic with the UNWTO stating that in the first quarter of 2023 alone, international visitors reached 80% of pre-pandemic levels, with more than double the number of 2022 travelers touring internationally and reaching 235 million. Of course, recovery has varied strongly by region and the Middle East was the only region in the world where tourism numbers reached pre-pandemic numbers in the first quarter of 2023, something that will definitely be a huge boost to some of the most profitable airlines in the world, a few of which are based in the Middle East. Many top airlines have struggled to even break even while attempting to recover from the pandemic but because of pent up demand for the most popular countries in the world, have been able to increase prices significantly without seeing a drop in passengers.', 'Despite the boost in revenue, airlines are still struggling to contain costs, and spiraling labor costs are contributing to profit targets being revised. While American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) had a good first half in 2023, its share price fell fell by 12.1% in August 2023, mainly due to a new contract for pilots which will avoid work disruption but see costs increase by 46%, which means that the pilots will take in $9.6 billion extra as compared to the previous contract through the duration that it is valid for. Because of this decline, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) has seen its share price fall by nearly 4% YTD, despite a stellar Q2 2023 performance. In its Q2 2023 earnings call, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) mentioned the record performance stating "" We continue to build on the strong foundation we have laid over the past year and remain focused on reliability, profitability, accountability and strengthening our balance sheet. That focus is showing up in our results. Everything we have said we would do at the start of the year, we have done. Our operation is performing at historically strong levels. And this morning, we reported adjusted pre-tax earnings of approximately $1.8 billion for the second quarter. These earnings were well above the high end of our latest EPS guidance range, marking our fifth consecutive quarterly profit. At the start of the recovery, we told you that returning to profitability hinged on running a reliable airline. American continues to run a strong operation in an evolving environment in which we are very well positioned because of the hard work our team has done in recent years. Our sustained profitability is tied to our leading network rewards program and operation.

This was driven by broad-based demand across all entities with a particular strength in demand for international travel leading into the summer.""', ""Of course, airlines weren't the only industry impacted heavily by the pandemic as the entire travel industry struggled significantly. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) is a company which provides various travel related online services known mainly for providing one of the most well-known platforms for booking hotels, but you can also book tours, restaurants and even flights on the website and app, especially for the most popular countries in the world. A stellar 2023 has seen Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) see its share price increase by more than 50% YTD 2023 with revenue increasing from $10.9 billion in 2021 to $17.1 billion in 2022. Here is what L1 Capital International Fund said about Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:"", '“Booking Holdings Inc.\xa0(NASDAQ:BKNG) was the largest positive contributor to the March 2023 quarterly performance. We meaningfully added to our investment in Booking in the middle of 2022 when the market was overly focused on disruptions to travel in Europe caused by airport understaffing and other COVID-19 induced inefficiencies, as well as concerns that an economic downturn would materially reduce discretionary travel. Since then, the travel environment has continued to normalise, with China being the last major market to open travel borders post COVID-19. People the world over have demonstrated their ongoing desire to travel, an industry that has historically grown significantly faster than GDP growth. Management has continued to execute a well-planned strategy to increase connections with customers booking accommodation, including offering flights, on ground transport, activities and payment options. After increasing over 20% in the December 2022 quarter, Booking’s share price increased a further 30%+ during the March 2023 quarter. Booking is now trading within our assessed view of fair value. We retain confidence that management will continue to deliver returns to shareholders and Booking remains one of the Fund’s largest holdings.”', 'Methodology', ""To determine the most popular countries in the world, we didn't rely on tourist numbers, as these can often be inflated by countries including transit passengers.

In more good news, the share price has risen 8.7% in thirty days. But this could be related to good market conditions -- stocks in its market are up 10% in the last month."", ""So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress."", ' See our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan ', ""There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", 'During the five years of share price growth, Freeport-McMoRan moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.', ""The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers)."", ""We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Freeport-McMoRan's earnings, revenue and cash flow."", ""As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Freeport-McMoRan, it has a TSR of 221% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."", ""Freeport-McMoRan provided a TSR of 2.6% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 26% a year, over half a decade) look better. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Freeport-McMoRan has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of."", 'Freeport-McMoRan is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

In this regard, I had the privilege of conducting interviews with several Cisco partners to discuss their challenges, uncover opportunities, and explore how Cisco can offer support."", ""Throughout these discussions, a common theme emerged: the need to bring our partners together for collaborative engagement, knowledge sharing, and in-depth conversations on building sustainable business models and offerings. The aim is to ensure not only the success of our partners but also the achievement of our mutual customers' sustainability goals."", 'Prioritizing sustainability is also a business imperative', ""A key revelation from these conversations is the recognition that prioritizing sustainability is not just an ethical choice; it's also a vital business imperative. While there may be situations where the choices between speed and convenience conflict with what is morally right, aligning our efforts with the objective of creating an inclusive and environmentally responsible future is not only ethically sound but also central to Cisco's overarching mission."", 'To help us share insights for the better good, the Americas partner sustainability community now convenes on a quarterly basis with a dedicated leadership team committed to helping customers realize their sustainability objectives. These gatherings provide valuable insights from Cisco leaders on the broader sustainability strategy. They also serve as a platform for introducing the latest Cisco programs and tools centered on sustainability, hosting industry and ecosystem partners to share their go-to-market strategies and offerings, discussing sustainability funding, and encouraging partners to share their own experiences and lessons learned.', 'Inclusive engagements', 'Sustainability is a concept that calls for inclusivity. It acknowledges that no single individual or group can bring about the needed changes on their own. What we require is a concerted effort that actively engages individuals empowered by organizations to create a culture of sustainability.', 'At Cisco, we strongly encourage everyone to engage with their local communities in ways that hold personal significance. This can take various forms, such as participating in beach cleanups, contributing to habitat restoration, supporting wildfire prevention, or engaging in organic waste and edible food recovery initiatives, among others. These efforts must address both the current sustainability challenges our planet faces today and inspire and educate future generations to carry this work forward.', 'Partnering for purpose', 'In addition, leadership plays a crucial role in driving these sustainability efforts. Leaders must lead by example, inspire others to join the cause, and ensure that everyone participates. It is a collective endeavor, and leaders must be at the forefront of the solution, making tangible commitments, both in financial terms and in the way their businesses operate, to become more sustainable entities.', 'At Cisco, our objective is to facilitate collaboration, create scalable solutions, and enable the sharing of best practices with partners globally. The ""Partnering for Purpose"" initiative aligns perfectly with Cisco\'s vision of an inclusive future. I\'m thrilled to announce that in fiscal year 2024, Cisco will introduce sustainability offerings across our services portfolio in four key areas: Sustainable Data Centers, Smart Buildings and Workspaces, Internet of the Future, and Industry Solutions and Ecosystems.', ""Reducing our carbon footprint necessitates a shift in mindset, challenging us to think differently about how we design technologies, support our employees, and help our customers address challenges. For instance, through Cisco Refresh, we remanufacture and certify used network routers, switches, phones, and collaboration products, extending the value of our customers' budgets while reducing the environmental impact associated with old technology. This is a win-win solution for all parties involved."", 'A Commitment to Sustainability', ""My aspiration is for all of us to lead happy, healthy lives and enjoy our planet in a way that ensures future generations can do the same. As a leader, I encourage others to integrate sustainable practices into every facet of their lives and endeavors. Building a culture of sustainability requires the commitment of all individuals to make choices today that will protect us from bearing the consequences of poor decisions tomorrow. Whether it's protecting our oceans, nurturing emerging leaders, or running our businesses in a manner that safeguards the future, sustainability is a shared endeavor that benefits us all."", 'To learn more about what commitments Cisco has made to ensure a better tomorrow, read our 2022 Cisco Purpose Report.', 'View original content here.', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.', 'View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/810739/sustainability-collaboration-and-cisco-a-channel-leaders-perspective']"
