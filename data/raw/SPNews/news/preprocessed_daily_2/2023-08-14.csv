Company highlights for the month of July 2023 include:This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230814007602/en/Core net new assets brought to the company by new and existing clients totaled $13.7 billion. Net new assets excluding mutual fund clearing totaled $11.9 billion.Total client assets were $8.24 trillion as of month-end July, up 13% from July 2022 and up 3% compared to June 2023.Average margin balances were $63.0 billion in July, down 13% from July 2022 and up 2% compared to June 2023.Commentary from the CFOChief Financial Officer Peter Crawford commented, ""As we continue to progress through the Ameritrade client conversion, we are observing initial evidence of the deal-related attrition we allowed for within the transaction math outlined at the announcement back in November 2019. These temporarily lower net flows reflect our organic asset gathering being offset by expected attrition within certain client cohorts, including recently converted Ameritrade retail clients as well as a modest number of Ameritrade advisor clients ahead of their planned transition to the Schwab platform in September. Additionally, we have elected to proactively resign from certain atypical custodial relationships previously served by Ameritrade’s institutional business that are inconsistent with our approach to serving Registered Investment Advisors. We anticipate these temporary conversion-related dynamics will subside following the completion of the final transition group during the first half of 2024. Based on our experience with the first two conversion groups, as well as our latest projections, we believe that the ultimate attrition will be in-line with or slightly better than our initial estimates – approximately 4% of Ameritrade revenue prior to the deal or around 1% of combined total client assets as of December 31, 2022. With all of this in mind, Schwab’s competitive position remains strong as July new brokerage accounts increased 9% from the prior year to 303 thousand - marking the 9th consecutive month of new accounts exceeding 300 thousand.Story continuesIn addition to our overall July results demonstrating healthy client engagement and momentum, the average daily pace of client cash realignment outflows during the month remained generally consistent with prior periods, even as strong net equity purchasing persisted throughout the month. The continuation of this trend further underscores our confidence that we will see a resumption of deposit growth later this year.""Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements relating to the Ameritrade client conversion; client attrition, including timing and estimates; net flows; competitive position; client engagement and momentum; client cash realignment pace and trends; and deposit growth.

If you want to skip our discussion on the banking industry, head directly to Goldman Sachs Bank Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks. Fitch Ratings forecasts that the strength of banking assets in several markets will decline compared to their robust historical performance. Business activities are likely to remain slow, given the inflation and interest rate pressures. However, the potentially positive impact of higher interest rates on net interest margins could partially counterbalance these factors. In some markets, particularly in the United States, stricter financial policies contribute to challenges related to deposit balances, shifts in deposit accounts, and increased deposit betas. Consequently, net interest margins have already reached their highest point or will do so soon, which hinders potential gains. Fitch Ratings provided a ‘deteriorating’ sector outlook to banking industries at the beginning of this year, particularly the United States, Canada, and some regions in Western Europe. Australian banks were assigned a ‘deteriorating’ outlook as well, while Hong Kong banks were allocated an ‘improving’ rating.Following the March 2023 banking crisis, the International Monetary Fund trimmed its estimates for the worldwide economy, citing “the recent increase in financial market volatility.” The IMF also revised its forecasts for economic expansion. It first expected a 3.4% growth in 2022, and now the growth estimate stands at 2.8% in 2023. IMF’s latest report said: “Uncertainty is high, and the balance of risks has shifted firmly to the downside so long as the financial sector remains unsettled.”Don't Miss: Goldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 2023Rising interest rates will elevate losses on securities held by banks and encourage savers to withdraw funds from their accounts, putting pressure on the primary way banks generate profits. Losses related to commercial real estate and other loans have only just started to become prominent for banks, further diminishing their financial performance. Following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, regulatory focus will shift towards medium-sized banks due to potential supervisory oversights. According to CNBC, many of America’s 4,672 banks will find themselves merging with stronger counterparts in the coming years, propelled either by market dynamics or regulatory policies. This forecast is based on insights from a dozen executives, advisors, and investment bankers surveyed by CNBC. A recent example is JPMorgan's acquisition of First Republic for $10.6 billion. Story continuesAlso Read: 15 Worst Performing Bank Stocks in 2023On August 8, Moody's downgraded the credit ratings of numerous small and medium-sized U.S. banks, while also placing several prominent banks under scrutiny for potential negative revisions. Major financial entities such as Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp, State Street, Truist Financial, Cullen/Frost Bankers, and Northern Trust are currently undergoing assessment for a potential downgrade. Moody’s analysts Jill Cetina and Ana Arsov commented in a research note:“U.S. banks continue to contend with interest rate and asset-liability management (ALM) risks with implications for liquidity and capital, as the wind-down of unconventional monetary policy drains systemwide deposits and higher interest rates depress the value of fixed-rate assets. Meanwhile, many banks’ Q2 results showed growing profitability pressures that will reduce their ability to generate internal capital. This comes as a mild U.S. recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline from solid but unsustainable levels, with particular risks in some banks’ commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios.”Amid the gloomy outlook for the banking industry, we take a look at Goldman Sachs’ Q1 2023 portfolio for the firm’s top bank stock picks. These include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). Our Methodology We used Goldman Sachs’ Q1 2023 portfolio and selected the 10 biggest positions in banks during the quarter for this list. We have mentioned Goldman Sachs’ stake value and the hedge fund sentiment towards each stock as of the first quarter of 2023. The list is ranked in the ascending order of the firm’s stake value in each holding. Goldman Sachs Bank Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksPhoto by Mikel Parera on UnsplashGoldman Sachs Bank Stocks: Top Stock Picks10. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $385,780,864Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is a holding company in the savings and loan sector. Its range of services include wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory. In Q1 2023, Goldman Sachs owned 7.3 million shares of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), worth $385.78 million. On July 28, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) declared a $0.25 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on August 25, to shareholders of record on August 11. For the third consecutive quarter, the company has declared a dividend of $0.25 per share. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 87 hedge funds were bullish on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), compared to 74 funds in the prior quarter. D E Shaw is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 12.2 million shares worth $642.7 million. In addition to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is one of the top Goldman Sachs bank stocks. Broyhill Asset Management made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“After the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the market turned a critical eye to the financial sector. Institutional investors sharpened their forensic accounting pencils and hypothesized, “What would happen to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) should its depositors take their money and run?” While this is a helpful exercise, we believe the probability of a run on Schwab Bank is low. Schwab is not SVB. Its deposit base is sticky and fragmented; Silicon Valley’s was not. Less than 10% of SVB’s deposit base was under the FDIC insurance limit, and its core customers were rate-sensitive startups and venture capitalists with fickle cash needs. In contrast, ~80% of Schwab’s deposit base is under the FDIC’s limit and spread across millions of brokerage accounts that keep cash on hand for investment. Rather than spending our time replicating doomsday scenarios, we began by estimating the risk to Schwab’s earnings power should it need to raise the rate paid on deposits in line with competitors. Even under this scenario, we believe our downside is limited. Longer term, we believe Schwab has multiple levers it can pull to monetize the ~ $7 trillion in assets trusted in its custody.”9.

This turmoil couldn’t help but have a negative impact on investor sentiment and in turn on Fund bank holdings such as Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).”6. Citigroup Inc.

One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Edwards Lifesciences achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 17% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 11% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. This free interactive report on Edwards Lifesciences' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 4.0% in the last year, Edwards Lifesciences shareholders lost 24%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering.

6,f7c82623-aa69-3668-8914-f21dbdfab0d9,WMT,2023-08-14,Walmart and Target are part of Zacks Earnings Preview,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-target-part-zacks-earnings-102700552.html,1692008820,STORY,"['WMT', 'TGT', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – August 14, 2023 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart WMT and Target TGT.Retail Earnings Looming: What to ExpectWalmart and Target shares lost roughly a quarter of their value in response to the disappointing April-quarter results on May 17th and 18th, 2022.Leading up to May 2022, these two stocks had performed roughly in line with each other, with Walmart slightly doing better than Target and both outperforming in the S&amp;P 500 index.Target shares never got their mojo back after the May 2022 beating and have actually lost ground in response to each of the following four quarterly releases. Walmart shares have had the opposite behavior, with the stock steadily gaining ground following subsequent quarterly releases.This performance context is important to keep in mind as we look ahead to the Target and Walmart quarterly results this week, the former before the market's open on Wednesday, August 16th, and Walmart the day after on Thursday morning (August 17th).Walmart's quarterly EPS estimates coming into this report have been very stable, with the current Zacks Consensus of $1.67 per share unchanged over the past two months. Unlike Walmart, there has been notable pressure on Target estimates, with analysts cutting their estimates on continued near-term challenges. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for Target of $1.49 is down from $1.57 a month ago, $1.58 two months ago, and $1.94 three months back.The stability in Walmart shares makes intuitive sense, as its core business offers a high degree of defense during periods of economic instability and uncertainty. Walmart's 'value orientation' allows it to gain market share as relatively better-off consumers 'trade down' during times of 'economic stress.'One key point of differentiation between these two retail giants is Walmart's bigger grocery business which gives its results greater stability given the 'staply' nature of that otherwise low-margin business. The relatively low-margin nature of groceries notwithstanding, they bring in foot traffic and are also responsible for the aforementioned 'trade down' phenomenon that is helping Walmart gain share.Story continuesAnalysts see relatively greater momentum in Walmart's business on the back of higher average selling prices and flat traffic, gains on the e-commerce side, and better margin results relative to what they reported last on May 18th. Target is seen as suffering from weak traffic during the period, with the price trend only marginally positive.Both companies struggled with evolving consumer behavior as the pandemic entered the rearview mirror. We saw this in their April 2022 quarterly results that we referenced at the top of this note, for which the market punished them.While both took drastic steps to steady their floundering ships, Walmart clearly did a better job adjusting to the new environment than Target. The 'shrinkage' aspect of inventory was also front and center when Target put a dollar number on the phenomenon the last time around. However, market participants appreciate that this aspect of 'inventory shrink' is hardly restricted to Target.With respect to the Retail sector 2023 Q2 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 19 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the realm in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor's standard industry classification.The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon (AMZN) and restaurant players. The 19 Zacks Retail companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have reported Q2 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.Total Q2 earnings for these 19 retailers that have reported are up +49% from the same period last year on +8.3% higher revenues, with 78.9% beating EPS estimates and 52.6% beating revenue estimates.The online players and restaurant operators easily beat earnings expectations but struggled with beating revenue estimates.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group's performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 19 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon's Q2 earnings were up +526% on +10.8% higher revenues, beating top-and-bottom-line expectations.As we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.One recurring theme in the Q2 earnings season has been the continued resilience and stability of the U.S. consumer. We heard this from the banks, the leisure and hospitality players, and consumer-facing digital operators.There is undoubtedly stress at the lower end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. Other issues, like the resumption of student loan payments, are seen as weighing on spending trends. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.We will hear more about that on the Walmart and Target earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods. But on the whole, consumer spending trends remained intact in 2023 Q2, and these results will reconfirm.Q2 Earnings ScorecardAs of Friday, August 11th, we have seen Q2 results from 457 S&amp;P 500 members, or 91.4% of the index's total membership. The Q2 reporting cycle has now come to an end for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors.We have more than 300 companies reporting results this week, including 17 S&amp;P 500 members. The notable companies reporting this week include, besides the aforementioned Walmart and Target, include Home Depot, Cisco Systems, Applied Materials, Deere &amp; Co.Total Q2 earnings for the 457 S&amp;P 500 members are down -9.5% from the same period last year on +0.48% higher revenues, with 79% beating EPS estimates and 65.2% beating revenue estimates.The Earnings Big Picture Please note that the -8.2% decline for Q2 earnings on -0.2% lower revenues is the blended growth picture for the quarter, which combines the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies.Q2 is on track to be the third quarter in a row of earnings declines and the first quarter of declining revenues. As noted earlier, a big part of the earnings and revenue weakness is due to the Energy sector.Excluding the Energy sector drag, Q2 earnings would be down -2.1% on +4.6% higher revenues.2023 Q2 will be the 6th consecutive quarter of declining margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Margins in Q2 are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest margin pressures expected to be in the Energy, Medical, Basic Materials, and Construction sectors.With the earnings focus lately on the Tech sector, it is instructive to see how much distance has been covered on the margins front in this key sector.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Tech Sector's Earnings Outlook Reflects Improvement  Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

(DE).The July retail sales report is due out Tuesday morning while the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting will be released Wednesday afternoon. Yahoo Finance will also feature a week-long special, Retail Evolution: The New Era, during our livestreaming programming beginning Monday morning.Last week, markets were mixed as August's lackluster trading continued during the month's first full week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) continued trudging higher, rising 0.6% on the week while the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both closed the week in the red. The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 enter the third week of August at their lowest levels in a month.Last week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed headline inflation's rapid cooldown took a pause in July, rising 3.2% last month after increasing 3% in June.But economists came away from the report focused on monthly price increases remaining low for the second straight month.On a monthly basis, core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy categories, increased 0.2% in July, the same increase as in June. That marked the first time since February 2021 that core CPI rose just 0.2% in consecutive months.""This month's soft core print confirms the disinflationary process,"" Morgan Stanley chief US economist Ellen Zentner wrote after the report on Thursday. ""After 6 months of 0.4% [month-over-month] prints, a second 0.16% [month-over-month increase] comes as a sign of continued deceleration.""Most Wall Street economists now see the Fed holding interest rates steady at its next meeting in September.Story continues""The Fed is attempting to fine tune the policy path as it gets close to the end of the hiking cycle and does not want to short-circuit the business cycle if inflation is already moving towards target,"" Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen wrote on Friday.The firm now expects the Fed will raise rates in November as opposed to next month, writing, ""An additional six weeks would give the Fed more time to assess the trajectory of the economy.""As of Friday afternoon, markets were pricing in a roughly 89% chance that the Fed holds steady at its September meeting, up from a 72% chance on July 11, per data from CME Group.The minutes from the Fed's July meeting, which will offer additional insight into how Fed officials see the future path of policy, are set for release at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday.Retail in focusFrom ""Barbie"" and Taylor Swift to economists pushing back or eliminating recession calls, a resilient consumer has been the story of the economy during the summer of 2023.Corporate results from major banks and some airlines have told a similar story too. There has been a slowdown, but in large part the consumer continues to spend more than most investors and economists had expected, leading to surprising growth in the American economy. This week will provide more key details on how Americans are spending and, more importantly, if companies think a second-half consumer slowdown is materializing.The July retail sales report is expected at 8:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday with economists anticipating sales increased 0.4% over the prior month. Retail sales increased 0.2% in June.""We expect a robust July sales report,"" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave wrote on Thursday, citing the company's credit and debit card data which showed spending was strong during the July 4 holiday. ""We forecast above-consensus increases of 0.7% and 0.6% in the Census Bureau's July figures for retail sales ex-autos and the core control group, respectively.""On the corporate side, investors will be looking to see if some of the cracks that appeared in the retail space three months ago have widened.In May, Home Depot warned consumers were completing smaller projects at home and buying fewer big-ticket items. Meanwhile, Target said its discretionary business, which includes items like technology and clothes, had begun to lag.Customers shop at a Walmart store on May 18, 2023, in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) (Scott Olson via Getty Images)At both Target and Walmart, investors will be focused on same-store sales, any signs of a consumer trade-down, how cooling inflation could be impacting margins, and the state of retail crime.At Target, any lasting impacts after customer backlash regarding the company's Pride Collection released in May will also be in focus. Walmart investors will be on the lookout for how grocery and pharmacy differentiate Walmart from other retailers.""The question is what happens in the back half of the year and into next year as some of the of the excess savings are worked down and the labor market becomes a little less certain,"" UBS analyst Michael Lasser told Yahoo Finance Live last week. ""I am expecting mixed results and a cautious tone from some of these retailers as the pressures linger on the consumer.""Weekly calendar MondayEarnings: Canoo (GOEV), Monday.com (MNDY), Rumble (RUM)Economic data: No notable economic news.

13,97d8d285-3ead-3616-b532-0e0fca74ec4a,MGM,2023-08-14,"Airlines, hotels branch out with experiences to lure travelers",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airlines-hotels-branch-experiences-lure-110304332.html,1692010984,STORY,['MGM'],"[By Doyinsola OladipoNEW YORK (Reuters) - Casino operator MGM Resorts International is finding Formula One's inaugural stop in Las Vegas is as much of a draw as its slot machines this year, and it is not the only company realizing that travelers are increasingly seeking out experiences beyond the traditional draws for tourists.Global travel has rebounded in a big way in the post-pandemic period, but travelers are no longer plunking down as much cash on souvenirs, and instead splurging on sporting events or concert tickets in new destinations.Airlines, hotels and travel operators are increasingly capitalizing on that, venturing beyond their usual services to arrange bookings for special experiences to keep customers.""Our gaming revenues are up but relatively flat,"" MGM Chief Executive Officer Bill Hornbuckle told Reuters, saying revenue growth was being driven by entertainment, and luxury food and drink experiences. ""There's just this appetite for experience at a higher level that people seem to be prepared to pay for.""Tourist spending on experiences like restaurants, amusement parks and nightclubs globally was up 65% in March 2023, the most recent month for which data is available, from March 2019, before the pandemic, according to Mastercard's Travel Industry Trends 2023 report. But spending by travelers on goods like cosmetics, jewelry and electronics is up just 12%, the report said.""People love experiences,"" Airbnb's CEO Brian Chesky told investors on a post-earnings call in early August. On the Airbnb website, 95% of reviews for experiences receive a 5-star review while 84% of home stays get that rating, he said.""That means that people on a statistical basis like experiences even more than homes,"" he said.Chesky said Airbnb, a website that allows travelers to book short-term room or home rentals, plans to expand its experience offerings in coming years.Other companies have also found revenues from experiences are growing.Story continuesOnline travel company Tripadvisor's experiences platform Viator posted a 59% rise in second-quarter revenue to $216 million. The platform accounted for about 44% of the company's revenue in the quarter, up from 33% a year ago, according to company figures.""2023 is on track to be another record-breaking year for our category. We’re outpacing last year’s and pre-pandemic bookings,"" said a Viator spokesperson.Around two-thirds of total travel globally is now booked online but just about 30% of things to do while on vacation are booked online, said Dan Wasiolek, Morningstar equity analyst.TRADITIONAL OPERATORS MUSCLE INTraditional hotel and flight operators are trying to tap into that business. American Airlines in June started giving loyalty members the ability to earn flight miles and points on entertainment purchases when they book through the airline's website. The company said it has seen a significant increase in members using the site to purchase event tickets.Hotel operator Marriott International in February named its first-ever ""chief customer officer"" to develop and execute the company's global consumer strategy.""We've been showcasing our experiences, which to me is about giving people access to things that they either couldn't necessarily plan or organize themselves,"" the new executive, Peggy Roe, said in an interview.She cited examples like an auction for members to learn tricks on the field as well as get manicures with a professional U.S. women's soccer player in Washington.Hornbuckle said MGM's occupancy level for November, when the Las Vegas F1 Grand Prix is scheduled, is double that in the same period a year ago, despite a higher price rate. He also said the biggest booking day of the year for the company in Las Vegas was the day the National Football League's Las Vegas Raiders released their yearly schedule for games.Hilton Worldwide saw a record number of points redeemed for experiences in 2022, and points redeemed for experiences so far this year have doubled from a year ago, said Brad Anderson, vice president of Hilton Honors Program Strategy.Competitor Hyatt Hotels launched an experience program in November 2022 with over 200 experiences like foraging in a Hungarian forest for truffles with expert hunters and their dogs or taking a spritz cocktail masterclass in Venice.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The US stock markets are undergoing a positive euphoria as several analysts have started to believe the much-anticipated recession everyone was worried about for about a year now might not happen after all. This is because the Federal Reserve’s fight against inflation is slowly but surely bearing some fruit. Inflation is declining and major research institutions which were vehemently predicting recession are having second thoughts. These positive developments are having a direct impact on the consumer discretionary sector, which suffered when dark clouds were hovering over the US economy and financial markets. When things go south, consumers cut back on discretionary spending and only spend on essential items, making consumer discretionary stocks worst performers when common households are not doing good. But as recession clouds abate and consumer confidence begins to rebound, consumer discretionary stocks are back in action.Deloitte published its State of the US Consumer report in July which shares some interesting insights that are directly linked to consumer spending and show what’s going on in US households when it comes to budget planning and spending. The report said that the percentage of respondents in the US who were concerned about their savings and who were delaying large purchases due to inflation fell in June, thanks to a clear fall in inflation. The report also said that “consumer spending intentions” rebounded in June after falling consistently for about a year. The Deloitte report retail sales jumped in May for the second straight month and they are already up about 31.6% from the pre-COVID levels.Last month, a Wall Street Journal report highlighted an important trend that adds another positive development in the latest cycle of positive news. The report said that for several months just a handful of companies were responsible for all the gains of the S&amp;P 500 index. But that trend is changing and major sectors are now adding to the broader market’s growth. Several stocks from the consumer discretionary sector were also noted to have added to the total market gains.Story continuesThe WSJ report said that over 140 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index have hit fresh 52-week highs since the end of May. Some of the notable companies from the consumer sector adding to these gains include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD).Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundswithGod/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor this article we first listed all the holdings of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund.

And then the question on how long do inflationary pressures persist, but — over the longer term, we believe we can achieve gradual improvement in profitability. I think if you get into like, are there any structural questions related to that? We’re seeing tangible benefit in freight cost, but we’re still — these costs still are not at pre-pandemic levels. And then we’re seeing some wage pressures in the stores. When you talk about — we’ve guided to CapEx of $810 million. So a big component of that in addition to distribution center capacity, in addition to investing in the 100 new stores, a big chunk of that is technology investments that will drive further efficiencies within the stores and in our distribution centers.So more automation in our distribution centers and some store initiatives that we’ve touched on in the past.Madison Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The bottom five contributors for the quarter were Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST), W.R. Berkley, Gartner, Glacier Bancorp, and Carlisle.

As it relates to our remaining guidance, we are pleased to reaffirm full year guidance on all other measures. As a reminder, that includes revenue growth of 10% to 12%, global comp growth near the high end of 7% to 9% and solid margin expansion. Store growth, capital spend and tax rate guidance also remain unchanged from what we shared previously. As a reminder, we expect an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points on fiscal year 2023 revenue and earnings, respectively.With that, let me provide further detail around our Q4. First, in regard to International. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we expect our International segment Q4 margin to expand year-over-year but to be meaningfully lower than Q3 due to seasonality along with accelerated digital and store renovation investments. Second, in regard to China, as I noted earlier, we expect China’s average weekly sales to continue to sustain the growth quarter-over-quarter, resulting in average weekly sales growth of low to mid-single digits in Q4, with similar sized comp growth as the market is lapping government stimulus for customers and favorable discounting from prior year coupled with the timing of difference of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which all contributed to prior year transaction growth.”The London Company Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) – Sentiment on SBUX turned more negative in this uncertain macro environment with the impending return of student loan payments in the U.S. SBUX reported very strong results for the Jan-March quarter, but exercised caution by not raising guidance. SBUX is beginning to realize tailwinds from the re-opening of the Chinese economy, adding a buffer to growth and margins for the remainder of the year.”6.

Brent crude futures finished at $86.21 a barrel, down 60 cents, or 0.69%.With fading hope China's economy will return to pre-pandemic levels of demand, oil markets have little to pin their hopes to for future growth, said Walter Zimmerman, chief technical analyst with ICAP-TA.""The problem is as China increasingly proves unable of getting out of its own way to the upside, much less leading the world economy, there's not much else to lead things higher.""Market participants are torn, weighing a tight supply-demand balance against signs of weakening demand from China, said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group.""Part of it seems to be the Monday morning blahs. I think we still have to face a market that's very tight,"" Flynn said.Vandana Hari, founder of oil market analysis provider Vanda Insights, said a correction may be in the cards for crude markets.""Crude has been in overbought territory for some time now, defying expectations of a correction,"" Hari said. She added that the focus had been on U.S. economic optimism, to the exclusion of economic headwinds in the euro zone and China.Weighing on oil prices, the U.S. dollar index extended gains after a slightly bigger increase in U.S. producer prices in July. That lifted Treasury yields despite expectations the Federal Reserve is at the end of a campaign of hiking interest rates. [FRX/]A stronger dollar pressures oil demand by making the commodity more expensive for buyers holding other currencies.Separately on Monday, a Shell spokesperson said exports of Nigeria's Forcados crude oil resumed on Sunday, roughly a month after loadings of the medium sweet grade were suspended because of a potential leak at the export terminal.Story continuesThe suspension contributed to Nigeria becoming the second-biggest contributor to the drop in OPEC crude oil output in July, a Reuters survey showed.Supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia, part of the OPEC+ group comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, are expected to erode oil inventories over the rest of the year, potentially driving prices higher, the International Energy Agency said in a monthly report on Friday.Around the Black Sea, merchant ships remained backed up in lanes on Monday as ports struggled to clear backlogs amid growing unease among insurers and shipping companies a day after a Russian warship fired warning shots at a cargo vessel.(Reporting by Erwin Seba in Houston; Additional reporting by Natalie Grover in London, Florence Tan in Singapore and Mohi Narayan in New Delhi; Editing by Jason Neely, Alexander Smith, Jan Harvey, Stephanie Kelly and Jonathan Oatis)]"

Both readings are expected to have declined further in July.Dollar strength hitting crudeThe strength of the U.S. dollar is also hurting the oil markets, with the greenback sitting at a five-week high after last week’s inflation readings provided more ammunition for the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer.A stronger dollar makes commodities priced in the greenback, like crude, more expensive, likely hitting demand among international buyers.Seven consecutive positive weeksAll that said, the oil markets have just registered seven weeks of gains on tightening supply after output cuts from primarily Saudi Arabia and Russia, under the umbrella of lower production targets by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+.Story continues“Sentiment remains largely positive with the oil balance set to continue to tighten, while stronger refinery margins are also providing some support,” analysts at ING said, in a note.That sentiment could be changing, though, as speculators have become reluctant to add to their positions, reducing their net long positions in Brent over the last reporting week.This suggests the market could now be in an overbought situation, with a correction possible in the coming days.(Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)Related ArticlesOil prices fall on China economic growth fears, stronger dollarWhite House finalizes guidance to boost use of U.S.-made goods in infrastructureCalifornia grid warns heat wave will stoke power demand]"

The call led to a retaliatory ban on Australian coal imports into one of the world’s biggest consumers of the commodity.Early this year, China received the first shipment of Australian coal in two years as Beijing signaled it was warming up to restoring trade relations with its former major supplier of the fossil fuel.Since then, Chinese imports of coal from Australia have soared, altering once again the trade patterns among Asia’s largest exporters and importers of coal.China is relying on coal to avoid blackouts as the economy reopened after the Covid lockdowns. During the first half of this year, coal production, coal imports, and coal-fired electricity generation jumped and offset a significant decline in power output at China’s massive hydropower capacity due to insufficient rainfall and drought.Total Chinese coal imports surged by 67% year over year in July, and soared by 89% in the first seven months of this year compared to the same period of 2022, official data from the Chinese General Administration of Customs showed this week.Australian coal is now flowing again to China, with arrivals at 5.45 million metric tons in July, compared to zero in December 2022, according to Kpler data reported by Clyde Russell, Asia Commodities and Energy Columnist at Reuters.While China resumed purchases from Australia, it has reduced imports from Indonesia, which in turn has changed the coal flows to India, another major importer in Asia. India has reduced purchases from Australia and is ramping up imports from Indonesia, per Kpler estimates.Story continuesIn a similar trade pattern, China has increased imports from Russia, while India has reduced Russian purchases.Despite the second big shift in Asian coal trade in three years, prices haven’t spiked, suggesting the market is fairly balanced, Reuters’ Russell notes.The Asian coal market is the most important market for the fuel and will be such in the future.Driven by robust growth in coal consumption in Asia, global coal demand this year will remain at the record-high levels hit in 2022, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in a new report last month.Last year, global coal demand increased by 3.3% to 8.3 billion tons—a new record-high, the agency said in its Coal Market Update.This year, coal demand will inch up by 0.4% year-on-year, to 8.388 billion tons, due to continued growth in industrial coal use which would offset an expected small decline in coal-fired power generation, according to the IEA estimates.“Whether coal demand in 2023 grows or declines, will depend on weather conditions and on the economies of large coal consuming nations,” the agency noted.The EU and the United States are leading the declines in coal use in the power sector, but Asia, especially China and India, more than offset these declines.In China, the top global coal consumer, demand jumped by 5.5% in the first half of 2023 compared to the same period last year due to very low hydro output so far this year, the IEA said. The agency sees China’s coal demand rising by about 3.5% in 2023, with demand from the power sector up 4.5% and demand from non-power uses growing by 2%. In India, the total increase in coal demand is expected at 5% annually this year.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Transition Tension: Greenlash Wave Jeopardizes Energy ReformEV Adoption Could Spell Trouble For Oil ExportersSimple Kitchen Ingredient Might Revolutionize Hydrogen StorageRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

We, however decided to study the company's financials to determine if they have got anything to do with the price decline. Stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, and therefore we decided to pay more attention to the company's financial performance. In this article, we decided to focus on Salesforce's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Salesforce How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Salesforce is:0.7% = US$379m ÷ US$57b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.01.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Salesforce's Earnings Growth And 0.7% ROEIt is hard to argue that Salesforce's ROE is much good in and of itself. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 11%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. Therefore, Salesforce's flat earnings over the past five years can possibly be explained by the low ROE amongst other factors.Story continuesWe then compared Salesforce's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 19% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is CRM worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether CRM is currently mispriced by the market.Is Salesforce Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Salesforce doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business. However, this doesn't explain why the company hasn't seen any growth. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Salesforce can be open to many interpretations. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

Top tech names such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) are teetering on 10% drops for the month. Mighty Microsoft's (MSFT) stock — for all the company's AI sizzle and love affair with OpenAI — is off by 4% in August. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has shed 2.1%.The only big-name tech stock working higher this month is Amazon (AMZN) (up 4%) — maybe because it's reportedly tracking whether workers back in the office are actually working. More productivity means more profits for Amazon (maybe), and there's nothing investors love more.The pullback in tech coincides with the 10-year Treasury yield rising from about 3.95% in late July to above 4.1% today. Yields back in early April were around 3.3%, for perspective.Blame Fitch's US credit rating downgrade prior to an avalanche of US debt issuances or the retrenchment in inflation sending cash into higher risk areas of markets. Whatever it is, higher yields could be here to stay for the time being, and that spells bad news for tech investors.Treasury yields may have not yet topped out. (RenMac) (RenMac)In fact, there is chatter on the Street that yields may have further room to run.""Despite rising odds that the Fed will pause at the September meeting, yields remain firm. Without taking any factors into account and just looking at the chart, yields do not look like a top to us and look poised to retest the highs from 2022. The 10 and 30-year have been making higher highs and higher lows since April and we’d need to see at least a lower low before suggesting a top may be in place,"" the strategy team at RenMac wrote in a new client note.The old rule of thumb is that tech stocks don't like a land of elevated yields. Higher borrowing costs, more attractive returns on cash, and more aggressive discounts on future growth are all part of the challenge facing tech highfliers when interest rates rise.Story continues""Our view is these higher rates, as we stay above the 4% level, will serve to put a cap on further valuation expansion. This had been a key driver of stock returns this year,"" astute market watcher Keith Lerner at Truist told me.""Already stocks are trading at the highest valuation level of the past 20 years, outside of the pandemic overshoot, which coincided with the Federal Funds rate at zero as opposed to above 5% today and a 10-year yield below 1%,"" Lerner added.Tread carefully, tech fans — at least until yields back up to below 4%.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the tech industry, head directly to Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.According to Gartner, the IT sector is expected to grow by 5.5% between 2022 and 2023. This means that the global tech industry is set to generate $4.6 trillion in spending this year, despite the rising cost of living. Deloitte observed that while other industries have started to adjust to pre-pandemic levels, the technology industry is still riding the pandemic highs. A survey conducted by the firm showed that the top three concerns for the tech industry over the next couple of years include macroeconomic factors, workforce-related problems, and geopolitical uncertainties. Per the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, US companies that plan to manufacture their own chips could receive financial assistance by the government. This is a welcome change given the global constraint in the supply for chips in the world. However, how this would impact the existing supply-chain relationships in the industry remains to be seen. Deloitte also expects strategic decisions to be made, regarding acquisitions and divesting, to focus on core product lines. Don't Miss: Top 12 Undervalued Tech Stocks According to AnalystsAs per McKinsey, the introduction of AI has taken the tech industry by storm. As more technology companies now explore enhancing their services through generative AI, the sector is provided with countless opportunities for growth and development. As per McKinsey’s estimates, AI-based services are expected to contribute $4.4 trillion in economic value. In addition, the tech industry saw over $1 trillion in combined investments since 2022. While the industry is poised for growth, recruiting top talent remains a major constraint for firms. Over the last year, job postings in the technology sector have increased by 15%. Some of the major areas for growth include Applied AI, Software Development, Trust Architecture, and Digital Identity, as per the McKinsey report. Artificial intelligence is the new buzz, with different kinds of applications for consumers, businesses, and industries around the world. As of last year, over $104 billion was recorded in equity investment in Applied AI, while job postings increased by 6% between 2021 and 2022. Similarly, over $2 billion was invested during 2022 in softwares to improve different processes. Meanwhile, the job postings increased by 29% for developers between 2021 and 2022. As the industry looks set for yet another wave of digital transformation, there is a heightened need for security and safety for data management. In line with that, roughly $47 billion was invested during 2022 for building safe architecture to protect cloud-based data from cyber breaches. Story continuesAlso read: 10 Best Financial and Fintech ETFs To BuyAccording to Forbes, there are a few major trends in the tech industry. Given the rising costs of living and other challenges of managing the workforce, one shared goal is to improve operational efficiency through machine learning and artificial intelligence within businesses. Next, the industry is moving towards developing tools that require no code. This is going to be beneficial for businesses and consumers to address their tech requirements, without a need for any experience in coding. Artificial intelligence is expected to improve further, as it gets incorporated into decision making, content generation, and editing. Consequently, AI can also be used for innovation in car-based applications, such as self-driving cars. Recently, the healthcare sector has capitalized on technological innovation as the industry undergoes digital transformation. As more cloud-based solutions are offered for different industries to better manage business processes, the tech industry is set to optimize operations across multiple sectors. With this industry outlook in mind, let's take a look  at Goldman Sachs’ top stock picks in the tech sector, which include the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Our Methodology We used Goldman Sachs’ Q1 2023 portfolio and selected the 12 biggest positions in tech firms during the quarter for this list. We have mentioned Goldman Sachs’ stake value and the hedge fund sentiment towards each stock as of the first quarter of 2023. The list is ranked in the ascending order of the firm’s stake value in each holding. Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 12 Stock PicksSource:PixabayGoldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top Stock Picks12. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Goldman Sachs' Stake Value: $1,640,035,093Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 138Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is a global leader in providing payment solutions worldwide. It provides secure and seamless authorisation and processing of payments internationally.

At the end of Q1 2023, Goldman Sachs held 4.5 million shares of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) worth $1.64 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 138 hedge funds were bullish on Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), as opposed to 139 in the previous quarter. Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management held the largest position in the company, with 5.8 million shares worth $2.13 billion. Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is one of the top tech stock picks of Goldman Sachs.LVS Advisory made this comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We have owned Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) on and off since inception. We re-initiated the position in summer 2022 during the broader market sell-off. The stock traded off to an attractive valuation and we believed the tailwinds from a reopening of international travel still had legs. This was a small portfolio position and the stock has appreciated in the year we have owned it. The stock’s valuation is once again rich and the tailwinds from international travel and consumer spending appear to be tapering. We sold the position because we believe other opportunities within our existing portfolio will generate superior returns.”11. Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS)Goldman Sachs' Stake Value: $1,793,493,600Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) is a cybersecurity company that specializes in providing secure access solutions to protect customers from cyberattacks, data breaches, and data loss. On July 25, BTIG analyst Gray Powell upgraded Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) stock from Neutral to Buy, with a price target of $185. The analyst highlighted that recent on-site assessments of SSE have shown a consistent and lasting enhancement. At the conclusion of Q1 2023, Goldman Sachs held 17 million shares of Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) valued at $1.79 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 38 hedge funds were bullish on Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS). This number was 42 during the previous quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors held a prominent stake in the company, with over 1 million shares worth $122.6 million. Artisan Global Discovery Fund had this to say about Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) provides cloud-based Internet security solutions. In the quarter, it announced 54% revenue growth and expected growth of nearly 40% in 2023 (ahead of expectations). Despite solid fundamental momentum, shares have underperformed this year as investors have grown concerned about slowing demand for enterprise software as the broader global economy slows. We believe the dual trends of rising security vulnerability and increased enterprise digitization will lead to sustained demand, even in a recession. Cybersecurity remains a top concern for businesses and governments alike as cyberattacks can have devastating financial and reputational consequences. Meanwhile, managing the security needs of legacy on-premise applications, a growing number of cloud-based applications (Office 365, Salesforce, etc.) and a more remote workforce (versus pre-pandemic) make operating IT infrastructures increasingly complex. Give the attractive long-term outlook and depressed valuations, we added to the position.”10. Cisco Systems, Inc.

We chose to use the proceeds on more attractive value opportunities as Cisco’s growth has come in below what we had hoped for, and the company is increasingly looking at M&amp;A to augment its growth rate.”9.

We trimmed several of the year’s winners on strength, including Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, CoStar Group, Inc. (CSGP), and CarMax.”8. MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTSI)Goldman Sachs' Stake Value: $2,157,047,100Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 13MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTSI) is a provider of semiconductor solutions worldwide.

The company is led by a relatively new management team taking steps to accelerate topline growth and expand margins. The leadership team’s strategy is to addresses smaller, long-duration product cycle markets in which it can provide a differentiated offering, especially in compound semis such as GaAs, Al-GaAs, InP and GaN-on-SiC, using its design expertise and its US-trusted foundry / Department of Defense approved status. Rolling out several new, higher margin products and expanding into adjacent end markets such as auto and consumer should drive a compelling profit cycle in the periods ahead.”7. Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK)Goldman Sachs' Stake Value: $2,677,404,332Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) is a provider of cloud services, software based solutions, and cybersecurity worldwide.

(NASDAQ:SPLK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We exited our position in Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) during the quarter. A number of developments caused us to question whether Splunk’s competitive position was eroding. Splunk is a premium product, and less expensive alternatives have made progress increasing the quality of their offerings. Our research has confirmed Splunk is losing market share to these players, including Microsoft’s Sentinel. Sentinel has made a number of improvements over time and integrates with Microsoft’s other products. Notably, both of Splunk’s Co-Presidents left Splunk in 2022 to work for Microsoft. Splunk’s Chief Financial Officer left a few months later. Before the CFO left, Splunk lowered its annual recurring revenue guidance for the year. While the company attributed the change to the macro environment, we were unable to differentiate to what extent the slowdown was caused by the macro environment versus competitive factors. Based on our primary research and competitive concerns, we no longer had sufficient confidence in Splunk’s value stability. Splunk no longer qualifies for investment, and we exited the position.”6. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Goldman Sachs' Stake Value: $3,533,157,774Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 173Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is one of the market leaders in providing payment solutions across the globe.

(NYSE:V) is one of the top tech picks of Goldman Sachs.Manole Capital Management had this to say about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We like to start out all of our discussions by telling investors who we are. We are FINTECH investors, and we define Fintech as “anything utilizing technology to improve an established process.” We realize that half of Fintech is financial, but we don’t invest in traditional, credit sensitive banks. Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) or Mastercard, that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:10 Best Warehouse and Self-Storage Stocks To Buy10 Best Inexpensive Stocks To Buy Right Now10 Oversold Healthcare Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The US stock markets are undergoing a positive euphoria as several analysts have started to believe the much-anticipated recession everyone was worried about for about a year now might not happen after all. This is because the Federal Reserve’s fight against inflation is slowly but surely bearing some fruit. Inflation is declining and major research institutions which were vehemently predicting recession are having second thoughts. These positive developments are having a direct impact on the consumer discretionary sector, which suffered when dark clouds were hovering over the US economy and financial markets. When things go south, consumers cut back on discretionary spending and only spend on essential items, making consumer discretionary stocks worst performers when common households are not doing good. But as recession clouds abate and consumer confidence begins to rebound, consumer discretionary stocks are back in action.Deloitte published its State of the US Consumer report in July which shares some interesting insights that are directly linked to consumer spending and show what’s going on in US households when it comes to budget planning and spending. The report said that the percentage of respondents in the US who were concerned about their savings and who were delaying large purchases due to inflation fell in June, thanks to a clear fall in inflation. The report also said that “consumer spending intentions” rebounded in June after falling consistently for about a year. The Deloitte report retail sales jumped in May for the second straight month and they are already up about 31.6% from the pre-COVID levels.Last month, a Wall Street Journal report highlighted an important trend that adds another positive development in the latest cycle of positive news. The report said that for several months just a handful of companies were responsible for all the gains of the S&amp;P 500 index. But that trend is changing and major sectors are now adding to the broader market’s growth. Several stocks from the consumer discretionary sector were also noted to have added to the total market gains.Story continuesThe WSJ report said that over 140 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index have hit fresh 52-week highs since the end of May. Some of the notable companies from the consumer sector adding to these gains include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD).Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundswithGod/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor this article we first listed all the holdings of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund.

(NASDAQ:ROST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) has performed well over the past year. Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) is up about 32% in the period.Out of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 53 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST). The biggest stakeholder of Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) was Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management which owns a $401 million stake in the company.In its Q1 earnings call, Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST)’s management, in a question on its plans to recapturing margins of pre-COVID times, said:""Our long-term operating margin improvements are to be highly dependent on us delivering strong sales over a sustained period of time. And then the question on how long do inflationary pressures persist, but — over the longer term, we believe we can achieve gradual improvement in profitability. I think if you get into like, are there any structural questions related to that? We’re seeing tangible benefit in freight cost, but we’re still — these costs still are not at pre-pandemic levels. And then we’re seeing some wage pressures in the stores. When you talk about — we’ve guided to CapEx of $810 million. So a big component of that in addition to distribution center capacity, in addition to investing in the 100 new stores, a big chunk of that is technology investments that will drive further efficiencies within the stores and in our distribution centers.So more automation in our distribution centers and some store initiatives that we’ve touched on in the past.Madison Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The bottom five contributors for the quarter were Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST), W.R. Berkley, Gartner, Glacier Bancorp, and Carlisle.

First, in regard to International. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we expect our International segment Q4 margin to expand year-over-year but to be meaningfully lower than Q3 due to seasonality along with accelerated digital and store renovation investments. Second, in regard to China, as I noted earlier, we expect China’s average weekly sales to continue to sustain the growth quarter-over-quarter, resulting in average weekly sales growth of low to mid-single digits in Q4, with similar sized comp growth as the market is lapping government stimulus for customers and favorable discounting from prior year coupled with the timing of difference of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which all contributed to prior year transaction growth.”The London Company Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) – Sentiment on SBUX turned more negative in this uncertain macro environment with the impending return of student loan payments in the U.S. SBUX reported very strong results for the Jan-March quarter, but exercised caution by not raising guidance.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Parker-Hannifin (NYSE:PH). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin How Quickly Is Parker-Hannifin Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Shareholders will be happy to know that Parker-Hannifin's EPS has grown 20% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note Parker-Hannifin achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 20% to US$19b. That's encouraging news for the company!In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Parker-Hannifin's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Parker-Hannifin Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Parker-Hannifin has a market capitalisation of US$53b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$274m. This comes in at 0.5% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Parker-Hannifin, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m.Parker-Hannifin's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$7.1m in the year leading up to June 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Does Parker-Hannifin Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Parker-Hannifin's strong EPS growth. If you still have your doubts, remember too that company insiders have a considerable investment aligning themselves with the shareholders and CEO pay is quite modest compared to similarly sized companiess. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to investing but it definitely makes Parker-Hannifin look rather interesting indeed. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   2 warning signs for Parker-Hannifin  you should be aware of.Although Parker-Hannifin certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the tech industry, head directly to Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.According to Gartner, the IT sector is expected to grow by 5.5% between 2022 and 2023. This means that the global tech industry is set to generate $4.6 trillion in spending this year, despite the rising cost of living. Deloitte observed that while other industries have started to adjust to pre-pandemic levels, the technology industry is still riding the pandemic highs. A survey conducted by the firm showed that the top three concerns for the tech industry over the next couple of years include macroeconomic factors, workforce-related problems, and geopolitical uncertainties. Per the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, US companies that plan to manufacture their own chips could receive financial assistance by the government. This is a welcome change given the global constraint in the supply for chips in the world. However, how this would impact the existing supply-chain relationships in the industry remains to be seen. Deloitte also expects strategic decisions to be made, regarding acquisitions and divesting, to focus on core product lines. Don't Miss: Top 12 Undervalued Tech Stocks According to AnalystsAs per McKinsey, the introduction of AI has taken the tech industry by storm.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc.

We re-initiated the position in summer 2022 during the broader market sell-off. The stock traded off to an attractive valuation and we believed the tailwinds from a reopening of international travel still had legs. This was a small portfolio position and the stock has appreciated in the year we have owned it. The stock’s valuation is once again rich and the tailwinds from international travel and consumer spending appear to be tapering. We sold the position because we believe other opportunities within our existing portfolio will generate superior returns.”11. Zscaler, Inc.

In the quarter, it announced 54% revenue growth and expected growth of nearly 40% in 2023 (ahead of expectations). Despite solid fundamental momentum, shares have underperformed this year as investors have grown concerned about slowing demand for enterprise software as the broader global economy slows. We believe the dual trends of rising security vulnerability and increased enterprise digitization will lead to sustained demand, even in a recession. Cybersecurity remains a top concern for businesses and governments alike as cyberattacks can have devastating financial and reputational consequences. Meanwhile, managing the security needs of legacy on-premise applications, a growing number of cloud-based applications (Office 365, Salesforce, etc.) and a more remote workforce (versus pre-pandemic) make operating IT infrastructures increasingly complex. Give the attractive long-term outlook and depressed valuations, we added to the position.”10. Cisco Systems, Inc.

The leadership team’s strategy is to addresses smaller, long-duration product cycle markets in which it can provide a differentiated offering, especially in compound semis such as GaAs, Al-GaAs, InP and GaN-on-SiC, using its design expertise and its US-trusted foundry / Department of Defense approved status. Rolling out several new, higher margin products and expanding into adjacent end markets such as auto and consumer should drive a compelling profit cycle in the periods ahead.”7. Splunk Inc.

A number of developments caused us to question whether Splunk’s competitive position was eroding. Splunk is a premium product, and less expensive alternatives have made progress increasing the quality of their offerings. Our research has confirmed Splunk is losing market share to these players, including Microsoft’s Sentinel. Sentinel has made a number of improvements over time and integrates with Microsoft’s other products. Notably, both of Splunk’s Co-Presidents left Splunk in 2022 to work for Microsoft. Splunk’s Chief Financial Officer left a few months later. Before the CFO left, Splunk lowered its annual recurring revenue guidance for the year. While the company attributed the change to the macro environment, we were unable to differentiate to what extent the slowdown was caused by the macro environment versus competitive factors. Based on our primary research and competitive concerns, we no longer had sufficient confidence in Splunk’s value stability. Splunk no longer qualifies for investment, and we exited the position.”6.

We are FINTECH investors, and we define Fintech as “anything utilizing technology to improve an established process.” We realize that half of Fintech is financial, but we don’t invest in traditional, credit sensitive banks. Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) or Mastercard, that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:10 Best Warehouse and Self-Storage Stocks To Buy10 Best Inexpensive Stocks To Buy Right Now10 Oversold Healthcare Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

If you want to skip our discussion on the banking industry, head directly to Goldman Sachs Bank Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks. Fitch Ratings forecasts that the strength of banking assets in several markets will decline compared to their robust historical performance. Business activities are likely to remain slow, given the inflation and interest rate pressures. However, the potentially positive impact of higher interest rates on net interest margins could partially counterbalance these factors. In some markets, particularly in the United States, stricter financial policies contribute to challenges related to deposit balances, shifts in deposit accounts, and increased deposit betas. Consequently, net interest margins have already reached their highest point or will do so soon, which hinders potential gains. Fitch Ratings provided a ‘deteriorating’ sector outlook to banking industries at the beginning of this year, particularly the United States, Canada, and some regions in Western Europe. Australian banks were assigned a ‘deteriorating’ outlook as well, while Hong Kong banks were allocated an ‘improving’ rating.Following the March 2023 banking crisis, the International Monetary Fund trimmed its estimates for the worldwide economy, citing “the recent increase in financial market volatility.” The IMF also revised its forecasts for economic expansion. It first expected a 3.4% growth in 2022, and now the growth estimate stands at 2.8% in 2023. IMF’s latest report said: “Uncertainty is high, and the balance of risks has shifted firmly to the downside so long as the financial sector remains unsettled.”Don't Miss: Goldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 2023Rising interest rates will elevate losses on securities held by banks and encourage savers to withdraw funds from their accounts, putting pressure on the primary way banks generate profits. Losses related to commercial real estate and other loans have only just started to become prominent for banks, further diminishing their financial performance. Following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, regulatory focus will shift towards medium-sized banks due to potential supervisory oversights. According to CNBC, many of America’s 4,672 banks will find themselves merging with stronger counterparts in the coming years, propelled either by market dynamics or regulatory policies. This forecast is based on insights from a dozen executives, advisors, and investment bankers surveyed by CNBC. A recent example is JPMorgan's acquisition of First Republic for $10.6 billion. Story continuesAlso Read: 15 Worst Performing Bank Stocks in 2023On August 8, Moody's downgraded the credit ratings of numerous small and medium-sized U.S. banks, while also placing several prominent banks under scrutiny for potential negative revisions. Major financial entities such as Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp, State Street, Truist Financial, Cullen/Frost Bankers, and Northern Trust are currently undergoing assessment for a potential downgrade. Moody’s analysts Jill Cetina and Ana Arsov commented in a research note:“U.S. banks continue to contend with interest rate and asset-liability management (ALM) risks with implications for liquidity and capital, as the wind-down of unconventional monetary policy drains systemwide deposits and higher interest rates depress the value of fixed-rate assets. Meanwhile, many banks’ Q2 results showed growing profitability pressures that will reduce their ability to generate internal capital. This comes as a mild U.S. recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline from solid but unsustainable levels, with particular risks in some banks’ commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios.”Amid the gloomy outlook for the banking industry, we take a look at Goldman Sachs’ Q1 2023 portfolio for the firm’s top bank stock picks. These include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). Our Methodology We used Goldman Sachs’ Q1 2023 portfolio and selected the 10 biggest positions in banks during the quarter for this list.

The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $385,780,864Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is a holding company in the savings and loan sector. Its range of services include wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory. In Q1 2023, Goldman Sachs owned 7.3 million shares of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), worth $385.78 million. On July 28, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) declared a $0.25 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on August 25, to shareholders of record on August 11. For the third consecutive quarter, the company has declared a dividend of $0.25 per share. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 87 hedge funds were bullish on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), compared to 74 funds in the prior quarter. D E Shaw is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 12.2 million shares worth $642.7 million. In addition to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is one of the top Goldman Sachs bank stocks. Broyhill Asset Management made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“After the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the market turned a critical eye to the financial sector. Institutional investors sharpened their forensic accounting pencils and hypothesized, “What would happen to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) should its depositors take their money and run?” While this is a helpful exercise, we believe the probability of a run on Schwab Bank is low. Schwab is not SVB. Its deposit base is sticky and fragmented; Silicon Valley’s was not. Less than 10% of SVB’s deposit base was under the FDIC insurance limit, and its core customers were rate-sensitive startups and venture capitalists with fickle cash needs. In contrast, ~80% of Schwab’s deposit base is under the FDIC’s limit and spread across millions of brokerage accounts that keep cash on hand for investment. Rather than spending our time replicating doomsday scenarios, we began by estimating the risk to Schwab’s earnings power should it need to raise the rate paid on deposits in line with competitors. Even under this scenario, we believe our downside is limited. Longer term, we believe Schwab has multiple levers it can pull to monetize the ~ $7 trillion in assets trusted in its custody.”9.

This turmoil couldn’t help but have a negative impact on investor sentiment and in turn on Fund bank holdings such as Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).”6. Citigroup Inc.

If you want to skip our discussion on the banking industry, head directly to Goldman Sachs Bank Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks. Fitch Ratings forecasts that the strength of banking assets in several markets will decline compared to their robust historical performance. Business activities are likely to remain slow, given the inflation and interest rate pressures. However, the potentially positive impact of higher interest rates on net interest margins could partially counterbalance these factors. In some markets, particularly in the United States, stricter financial policies contribute to challenges related to deposit balances, shifts in deposit accounts, and increased deposit betas. Consequently, net interest margins have already reached their highest point or will do so soon, which hinders potential gains. Fitch Ratings provided a ‘deteriorating’ sector outlook to banking industries at the beginning of this year, particularly the United States, Canada, and some regions in Western Europe. Australian banks were assigned a ‘deteriorating’ outlook as well, while Hong Kong banks were allocated an ‘improving’ rating.Following the March 2023 banking crisis, the International Monetary Fund trimmed its estimates for the worldwide economy, citing “the recent increase in financial market volatility.” The IMF also revised its forecasts for economic expansion. It first expected a 3.4% growth in 2022, and now the growth estimate stands at 2.8% in 2023. IMF’s latest report said: “Uncertainty is high, and the balance of risks has shifted firmly to the downside so long as the financial sector remains unsettled.”Don't Miss: Goldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 2023Rising interest rates will elevate losses on securities held by banks and encourage savers to withdraw funds from their accounts, putting pressure on the primary way banks generate profits. Losses related to commercial real estate and other loans have only just started to become prominent for banks, further diminishing their financial performance. Following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, regulatory focus will shift towards medium-sized banks due to potential supervisory oversights. According to CNBC, many of America’s 4,672 banks will find themselves merging with stronger counterparts in the coming years, propelled either by market dynamics or regulatory policies. This forecast is based on insights from a dozen executives, advisors, and investment bankers surveyed by CNBC. A recent example is JPMorgan's acquisition of First Republic for $10.6 billion. Story continuesAlso Read: 15 Worst Performing Bank Stocks in 2023On August 8, Moody's downgraded the credit ratings of numerous small and medium-sized U.S. banks, while also placing several prominent banks under scrutiny for potential negative revisions. Major financial entities such as Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp, State Street, Truist Financial, Cullen/Frost Bankers, and Northern Trust are currently undergoing assessment for a potential downgrade. Moody’s analysts Jill Cetina and Ana Arsov commented in a research note:“U.S. banks continue to contend with interest rate and asset-liability management (ALM) risks with implications for liquidity and capital, as the wind-down of unconventional monetary policy drains systemwide deposits and higher interest rates depress the value of fixed-rate assets. Meanwhile, many banks’ Q2 results showed growing profitability pressures that will reduce their ability to generate internal capital. This comes as a mild U.S. recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline from solid but unsustainable levels, with particular risks in some banks’ commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios.”Amid the gloomy outlook for the banking industry, we take a look at Goldman Sachs’ Q1 2023 portfolio for the firm’s top bank stock picks. These include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). Our Methodology We used Goldman Sachs’ Q1 2023 portfolio and selected the 10 biggest positions in banks during the quarter for this list. We have mentioned Goldman Sachs’ stake value and the hedge fund sentiment towards each stock as of the first quarter of 2023. The list is ranked in the ascending order of the firm’s stake value in each holding. Goldman Sachs Bank Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksPhoto by Mikel Parera on UnsplashGoldman Sachs Bank Stocks: Top Stock Picks10. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $385,780,864Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is a holding company in the savings and loan sector. Its range of services include wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory. In Q1 2023, Goldman Sachs owned 7.3 million shares of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), worth $385.78 million. On July 28, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) declared a $0.25 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on August 25, to shareholders of record on August 11. For the third consecutive quarter, the company has declared a dividend of $0.25 per share. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 87 hedge funds were bullish on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), compared to 74 funds in the prior quarter. D E Shaw is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 12.2 million shares worth $642.7 million. In addition to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is one of the top Goldman Sachs bank stocks. Broyhill Asset Management made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“After the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the market turned a critical eye to the financial sector. Institutional investors sharpened their forensic accounting pencils and hypothesized, “What would happen to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) should its depositors take their money and run?” While this is a helpful exercise, we believe the probability of a run on Schwab Bank is low. Schwab is not SVB. Its deposit base is sticky and fragmented; Silicon Valley’s was not. Less than 10% of SVB’s deposit base was under the FDIC insurance limit, and its core customers were rate-sensitive startups and venture capitalists with fickle cash needs. In contrast, ~80% of Schwab’s deposit base is under the FDIC’s limit and spread across millions of brokerage accounts that keep cash on hand for investment. Rather than spending our time replicating doomsday scenarios, we began by estimating the risk to Schwab’s earnings power should it need to raise the rate paid on deposits in line with competitors. Even under this scenario, we believe our downside is limited. Longer term, we believe Schwab has multiple levers it can pull to monetize the ~ $7 trillion in assets trusted in its custody.”9. Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. (NYSE:ITUB)Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $450,759,440Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A.

Macro-uncertainty also presented us with an opportunity to buy shares of Brazilian financial services company, Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. (NYSE:ITUB). The company is led by a dynamic CEO, who is utilizing technology in the private banking sector as part of a broader move towards digitization. This strategy is not only reducing distribution costs, but is enabling the creation of new products in high market share areas such as private banking, credit cards, as well as small- and medium-size business lending. An attractive valuation, strong net interest margins and high return on equity are among the attributes motivating our purchase of shares.”8.

While it would appear that a crisis was avoided by the quick intervention of bank regulators in the US and Switzerland, some uneasiness still remains in the global banking community. This turmoil couldn’t help but have a negative impact on investor sentiment and in turn on Fund bank holdings such as Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).”6. Citigroup Inc.

(DE).The July retail sales report is due out Tuesday morning while the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting will be released Wednesday afternoon. Yahoo Finance will also feature a week-long special, Retail Evolution: The New Era, during our livestreaming programming beginning Monday morning.Last week, markets were mixed as August's lackluster trading continued during the month's first full week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) continued trudging higher, rising 0.6% on the week while the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both closed the week in the red. The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 enter the third week of August at their lowest levels in a month.Last week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed headline inflation's rapid cooldown took a pause in July, rising 3.2% last month after increasing 3% in June.But economists came away from the report focused on monthly price increases remaining low for the second straight month.On a monthly basis, core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy categories, increased 0.2% in July, the same increase as in June. That marked the first time since February 2021 that core CPI rose just 0.2% in consecutive months.""This month's soft core print confirms the disinflationary process,"" Morgan Stanley chief US economist Ellen Zentner wrote after the report on Thursday. ""After 6 months of 0.4% [month-over-month] prints, a second 0.16% [month-over-month increase] comes as a sign of continued deceleration.""Most Wall Street economists now see the Fed holding interest rates steady at its next meeting in September.Story continues""The Fed is attempting to fine tune the policy path as it gets close to the end of the hiking cycle and does not want to short-circuit the business cycle if inflation is already moving towards target,"" Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen wrote on Friday.The firm now expects the Fed will raise rates in November as opposed to next month, writing, ""An additional six weeks would give the Fed more time to assess the trajectory of the economy.""As of Friday afternoon, markets were pricing in a roughly 89% chance that the Fed holds steady at its September meeting, up from a 72% chance on July 11, per data from CME Group.The minutes from the Fed's July meeting, which will offer additional insight into how Fed officials see the future path of policy, are set for release at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday.Retail in focusFrom ""Barbie"" and Taylor Swift to economists pushing back or eliminating recession calls, a resilient consumer has been the story of the economy during the summer of 2023.Corporate results from major banks and some airlines have told a similar story too. There has been a slowdown, but in large part the consumer continues to spend more than most investors and economists had expected, leading to surprising growth in the American economy. This week will provide more key details on how Americans are spending and, more importantly, if companies think a second-half consumer slowdown is materializing.The July retail sales report is expected at 8:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday with economists anticipating sales increased 0.4% over the prior month. Retail sales increased 0.2% in June.""We expect a robust July sales report,"" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave wrote on Thursday, citing the company's credit and debit card data which showed spending was strong during the July 4 holiday. ""We forecast above-consensus increases of 0.7% and 0.6% in the Census Bureau's July figures for retail sales ex-autos and the core control group, respectively.""On the corporate side, investors will be looking to see if some of the cracks that appeared in the retail space three months ago have widened.In May, Home Depot warned consumers were completing smaller projects at home and buying fewer big-ticket items. Meanwhile, Target said its discretionary business, which includes items like technology and clothes, had begun to lag.Customers shop at a Walmart store on May 18, 2023, in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) (Scott Olson via Getty Images)At both Target and Walmart, investors will be focused on same-store sales, any signs of a consumer trade-down, how cooling inflation could be impacting margins, and the state of retail crime.At Target, any lasting impacts after customer backlash regarding the company's Pride Collection released in May will also be in focus. Walmart investors will be on the lookout for how grocery and pharmacy differentiate Walmart from other retailers.""The question is what happens in the back half of the year and into next year as some of the of the excess savings are worked down and the labor market becomes a little less certain,"" UBS analyst Michael Lasser told Yahoo Finance Live last week.

To skip the detailed analysis of the gold industry, go directly to the 5 Cheap Gold Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.Gold is considered one of the biggest safe haven assets. In 2022, the international demand for gold was around 3,303 metric tons which shows a significant improvement from 2020 when the pandemic triggered a drop in gold demand to 2,301 metric tons, the lowest since 2010. China and India are the countries with the highest gold consumption as of 2022.Despite being considered an inflation hedge, gold has shown a high amount of volatility. One of the main reasons is that interest rate hikes have an adverse effect on the prices of precious metals. However, 2023 has been a good year for gold and its per-ounce price rose by 5.4% in the first half of 2023, closing at $1,912.25 per ounce in June. We can see that the gold rates are rising even with the rising interest rates which usually isn’t the case for precious metals. This can be attributed to the fact that investments in gold are considered to be more secure and safe during economic crises. At the time of writing on August 2, per ounce gold price closed at $1934.50.According to an Invesco survey of the central bank and sovereign wealth funds, several countries are retrieving their gold stored outside of their countries in light of sanctions imposed by the West on Russia. Around 60% of the survey participants believe gold to be more attractive and 68% of the participants were keeping reserves in their country, up from 50% in 2020.Industry OutlookAt the end of June, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England increased interest rates, while the US Federal Reserve took a break from the hike only to raise it by 25 bps in July. Experts believe that the hikes are nearing an end which bears good news for precious metals, including gold and silver.Nevertheless, the recession fears have slightly eased but still aren’t over and during these times gold’s intrinsic value is much more attractive than other investments such as stocks and bonds. While all other stocks and bonds become a little unappealing, gold stocks can be expected to do well due to the rising demand for yellow metal. Story continuesMoreover, companies like Centerra Gold Inc. (NYSE:CGAU) and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) seem quite positive about their H2 2023 performance in terms of revenue and production. At its Q2 2023 earnings call, Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM)’s Chief Executive Officer, Tom Palmer said:“As planned, higher gold production is expected in the second half of the year, and will be driven by higher grades and tonnes mined from both Subika Underground and open pit at Ahafo. Higher grades and tonnes mined Cerro Negro is the first wave of our district expansion which comes online in the third quarter. Higher tonnes mined and processed at Tanami, where we will mine the highest grades for the year in the fourth quarter.”11 Cheap Gold Stocks To Buy According to AnalystsPhoto by Gold-bar-jingming-pan on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we chose 11 companies that have significant operations in the gold industry based on their average analyst price targets as of the August 2 market close.

(NYSE:WPM) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Precious Metals Royalty basket (Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM), SSL, TFPM): In the current macroeconomic environment, there are many ways to ‘win’ with gold. It is remarkable that even with record positive real yields, gold is flirting with all time highs. Why? Western central banks are increasing interest rates which means that they will have to pay more interest on the record levels of debt that their government’s owe. Where will the money come from to pay the higher interest expense? The answer is simple – more debt and more money printing! We believe the gold knows this! We believe that precious metals will protect real purchasing power and act as a hedge to the portfolio when macroeconomic uncertainty arises. Owning royalty companies at reasonable valuations gives us a high quality exposure to precious metals without project or cost inflation risks inherent in a mining company.”9.

49,e4324bc9-efca-31e6-83c9-d69a884a1e01,NEM,2023-08-14,7 Stocks to Buy Now to Beat the Inflation Blues,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-now-beat-222454212.html,1691447094,STORY,"['NEM', 'ACI', 'VLO', 'GOOGL', 'PRTS', 'SO', 'AWK']","[In June, annual inflation (from the most recent data) slipped to 3%, which on paper clashes with the concept of stocks to beat inflation. After all, NPR pointed out that the aforementioned statistic represented the lowest point since March 2021. That’s a sign that the Federal Reserve’s hawkish interest rate hiking campaign is making an impact.However, the main challenge with this thesis is the “core inflation” indicator, which strips out volatile food and energy prices. Unfortunately, this metric clocked in at 4.8% in June, well above the Fed’s target of 2%. At the time, analysts speculated that the central bank would raise rates again to combat price acceleration. It did just that, which seems to clash again with inflation-proof stocks.Nevertheless, the labor market remains robust, which is why investors should still buy stocks for inflation protection. True, the latest tally in July slipped against expectations. However, the unemployment rate also sank back to 3.5%, indicating labor sector resilience.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPut another way, more dollars continue to chase after fewer goods. So, you should beat inflation with stocks that might cynically rise in this heightened environment.Newmont (NEM)A pile of shining gold bars. Gold stocksSource: ShutterstockFrankly, the narrative for metals and mining giant Newmont (NYSE:NEM) as one of the stocks to beat inflation speaks for itself. Should inflation worsen, the commodities sector will almost surely benefit. Not only that, Newmont’s gold business should blossom. Historically, gold carries a reputation for being a safe-haven asset against inflationary pressures.Further, I appreciate that you can accrue some decent passive income with NEM. Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 3.91%. That’s noticeably above the materials sector’s average yield of 2.82%. Also, while the payout ratio isn’t the lowest, at 58.95%, investors shouldn’t fret too much about yield sustainability.Story continuesFinancially, Newmont could use some improvements as the company tackled the headwinds associated with the Covid-19 crisis and later the Fed’s hawkish monetary policy. Still, if the central bank can’t tackle elevated prices, NEM makes a compelling case for inflation-proof stocks.Southern Company (SO)the southern company logo displayed several times on a screenSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comA gas and electric utility holding firm, Southern Company (NYSE:SO) offers, in my opinion, a no-brainer for stocks to beat inflation. Basically, the case for SO comes down to its underlying natural monopoly. According to Southern’s public profile, it serves nine million customers. You’re not just going to come in and compete with this enterprise.Another fundamental catalyst for SO – and one you should pay attention to if you want to buy stocks for inflation protection – is the necessity of the business. Unlike a discretionary purchase like an overpriced latte at a fancy coffee shop, you must pay your bills. Otherwise, you suffer a ripple effect that could easily ruin your life.Lastly, investors seeking to beat inflation with stocks should earmark SO. Not only does it provide an indelible business, but it also offers robust passive income. Currently, Southern carries a forward yield of 4.13%, above the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%.American Water Works (AWK)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comAnother candidate for no-brainer ideas for stocks to beat inflation, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is a public utility that provides water and wastewater services in the U.S. Per its corporate profile, the company serves approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states. Overall, the underlying user base comes out to about 14 million through 3.4 million customer connections.Again, if you want to buy stocks for inflation protection, you’ve got to think cynically. You’re looking for businesses that no matter what people must engage. Obviously, holistic water-related services represent one of the most important. If you don’t believe me, don’t pay your water bills. Let’s see how quickly that steamrolls into one giant pile.Primarily, American Water is indelible so it doesn’t need that much coaxing as it relates to inflation-proof stocks. But as a bonus, the company also carries a forward yield of 1.99%. While it’s lower than the utility sector’s average yield, American Water Works also commands 14 years of consecutive annual dividend increases.Valero Energy (VLO)3D rendered two black oil barrels on digital financial chart screen with yellow numbers and rising, green, falling, red arrows on black background. Oil stocksSource: stockwars / Shutterstock.comA downstream energy specialist, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) focuses mostly on manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels. While the political and ideological narrative has shifted toward the electrification of mobility, the harsh reality is that electric vehicles are still too expensive for average households. Plus, inflation would likely force consumers to make do with what they have, not go out and buy replacement vehicles.With people stuck with their combustion-powered vehicles, Valero should benefit cynically. Therefore, I anticipate VLO to rise as one of the stocks to beat inflation. Yes, shares have only gained about 6% since the Jan. opener. However, over the trailing one-year period, they’re up nearly 21%. Another benefit to targeting Valero as one of the inflation-proof stocks centers on its passive income. Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 3.22%. It’s a bit lower than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. However, you must also factor in the low payout ratio of 30.9%.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comOff the top, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) might seem like a strange idea if you want to buy stocks for inflation protection. However, the owner of the massive Google ecosystem should thrive under a framework of rising or elevated prices. During difficulties, people look for different avenues to cope. And what better way to find information than through Google? After all, it dominates the global search engine market.Another fundamental factor that should lift GOOG as one of the stocks to beat inflation is its YouTube video content platform. With so much (free) information available there, you can practically pick up a doctorate degree or two in whatever subject you’re studying. Here, people searching for lifehacks to save money to tips on landing a dream job should translate to greater engagement. And that engagement leads to more advertising dollars.Plus, the company continues to benefit from solid revenue and EBITDA growth. As well, it’s consistently profitable with a trailing-year net margin of 21%. If you want to beat inflation with stocks, take a look at GOOG.Albertsons (ACI)Albertsons (ACI) store with logoSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWading into the riskier ideas for stocks to beat inflation, grocery giant Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) cuts a somewhat disappointing figure. Since the start of the year, ACI gained just a hair over 5%. During the trailing one-year period, shares slipped almost 20%. Nevertheless, the main fundamental catalyst of the trade-down effect should help invigorate sentiment.As a McKinsey &amp; Company report indicated earlier this year, consumers hurt by inflation are trading down. Basically, they’re forgoing expensive brands or stores for their lower-cost alternative. Eventually, I forecast you’ll see wholesale trade downs. In particular, people won’t be so eager to eat out at fancy restaurants. Instead, they’ll cook for themselves and their families.Also, while Albertsons presents significant risks, it also entices investors who want to buy stocks for inflation protection. Notably, the market prices ACI at a forward multiple of 7.76. As a discount to projected earnings, Albertsons ranks better than 96.83% of the defensive retail competition.CarParts.com (PRTS)A stack of auto partsSource: ShutterstockTo be upfront, online aftermarket auto parts provider CarParts.com (NASDAQ:PRTS) ranks among the riskiest ideas for stocks to beat inflation. It’s incredibly relevant because of the conditions impacting the consumer economy. However, since the Jan. opener, PRTS lost more than 28% of its equity value. During the trailing one-year period, PRTS gave up over 46%.At the same time, the fundamentals are aligning beautifully (albeit cynically) for CarParts.com. As data from S&amp;P Global Mobility showed, this year, the average age of passenger vehicles on U.S. roadways hit 12.5 years, a record. This dynamic confirms that people are hurting with higher prices. It’s not just “paper” pain. What’s more, the framework has a consequential effect on the auto parts industry. In other words, consumers are going to drive their incumbent vehicles until the wheels fall off. This factor alone should be a huge catalyst for PRTS. That’s why I’m including it on this list of inflation-proof stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Here's how the food commodity markets are responding.",Business Insider,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/13872979-c06b-3e73-b22d-ce0636a43f8c/bad-weather%2C-natural.html,1691960279,STORY,"['LH=F', 'CC=F', 'RR=F', 'OJ=F']","[iStock/ Sean PavoneNatural catastrophes and bad weather have wreaked havoc on food crops across the world.Orange juice futures, cacao beans, and rice have hit all-time highs of late – while Chinese pork has slumped.Here's a round-up of the main movements in food commodity prices this week.Natural disasters, adverse weather, and invasive diseases have all helped wreak havoc on the market for some of the world's most important foodstuffs.A succession of hurricanes and deadly bacteria have ravaged American oranges, while heavy rainfall has rotted cacao beans in West Africa. As of Wednesday, Asian rice hit its highest price in almost 15 years; while in China, pork prices have slumped so far that they have dragged inflation into negative territory.Here's a roundup of what's been happening in the world of soft commodities lately.Orange juiceOrange juice futures hit an all-time high on July 28, as citrus crops all across the US have been hammered by a series of hurricanes and the spread of 'citrus greening', an incurable disease spread by insects.The ICE US frozen orange futures index touched a record 317.5 (USc per lb) – a metric that reflects orange juice production in the US as the lowest in ""over 100 years"", Matthew Joyner, chief executive of Florida Citrus Mutual, told the Financial Times.The vast majority of oranges produced in the US come from Florida, which has been hobbled by hurricanes and a cold snap, massively hampering supply. Not only adverse weather conditions, but the resurgence of the pathogen,  has ravaged crops in both America and Brazil.Such headwinds are responsible for the supply shortage in oranges, which has driven up prices that will eventually filter through to consumers.Chinese pork Chinese pork prices have fallen by over a quarter since the previous July as an oversupply of meat has weighed heavily on consumer food prices, pushing the Asian state into a period of deflation.Story continuesPork plays an important part in the makeup of China's Consumer Price Index basket, accounting for around 3% of it, per the Economist Intelligence Unit. ""A rough rule of thumb is therefore that a 10% increase in the pork price will push up the CPI by 0.3%,"" the EIU said in a research note, underscoring the animal's importance to the economy.Data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that pork prices have fallen 26% in July year-on-year, a significant fall for the world's largest producer and consumer of the meat. The decline in prices can be attributed to oversupply in the market, caused by a backlog after a bad outbreak of African swine fever.Cocoa beansOrange juice is not the only sweet to see its value jump recently – on Monday, cocoa bean futures surged to their highest levels since 2011, according to data by Barchart.The beans, used primarily in chocolate, are rallying amid a supply crunch caused by heavy rainfall and the spread of a black pod disease in West Africa, which has rotted cocoa pods.The spread of the blight caused by the extreme wet weather could result in lower crop quality and production, pushing the global cocoa market into a third year of deficit for the 2023/24 season, according to Barchart.Asian riceRice has not been this expensive in almost 15 years, as exceptionally dry weather in Thailand and India and the banning of its own exports foster a global shortage in the crop.The price of Thai white rice 5% broken has hit $648 a ton – the highest since October 2008 – according to Bloomberg data from the Thai Rice Exporters Association released Wednesday.Amid the onset of El Niño, where water temperature in the Pacific rises, Thai farmers are being encouraged to switch to growing crops that require less water. While India, another key producer, last month extended its export ban to protect domestic supply – and this has increased fears of a supply shortage.Rice is integral to the diets of billions of people around the globe, and a shortage may potentially spell catastrophe for households.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

The further above 0, the more stretched supply chains are. • Index &lt; 0, supply chain capacity is being underutilized. The further below 0, the more underutilized supply chains are.In fact, global supplier spare capacity was nearly on par with its zenith during the pandemic in May 2020, rising for a fourth month in succession and indicating a considerable weakening of global economic conditions.July data signalled a weak start to the second half of 2022 for the global economy, with demand for commodities, components and raw materials remaining depressed. Demand weakened in Europe especially as conditions in major markets such as the United Kingdom, Germany and France worsened. In fact, excess capacity at European suppliers reached its highest level since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. In contrast, demand in North America fell to a weaker extent than in June, tentatively pointing to some divergence in the trajectory of the economies on either side of the Atlantic.Commenting on the July data, Jonathan Kinghan, vice president, supply chain consulting, GEP, said: ""We're now in the 14th consecutive month of subdued demand across Europe, and our July data shows it's getting significantly worse across the continent, in contrast to North America. Our data does not indicate a 'soft landing' in Europe. As a result, companies have greater leverage to negotiate favourable terms from suppliers for 2024 and 2025.""Story continuesJuly 2023 Key Findings: DEMAND: Global demand for commodities, components and raw materials continues to weaken at the strongest pace since the start of the year. Europe is seeing the steepest downturn in demand by a notable margin, while purchasing activity in Asia fell slightly in July. North American demand conditions were less depressed than in June, hinting at potential divergences opening between major markets.INVENTORIES: Reports from businesses of safety stockpiling fell below the long-run average in July as a result of sustained efforts by companies to destock. However, in North America, stockpiling ticked up slightly in July, despite months of subdued demand.MATERIALS SHORTAGES: Supply shortages have ended, with reports of item scarcity now in line with historically normal levels.LABOR SHORTAGES: Despite historically low unemployment in economies such as U.S., reports of backlogs directly due to a lack of employees are historically low.TRANSPORTATION: Global transportation costs fell further to the lowest level since January 2016.REGIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN VOLATILITY NORTH AMERICA: Index rose to -0.37 from -0.85, indicating slower rise in excess capacity.EUROPE: Index down to its lowest level since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis at -1.07, from -0.67 in June, indicating marked worsening of economic conditions in Europe.U.K.: Index fell to -1.01, from -0.66 as weakness in major trading partners in Europe spills over, driving a sharper rise in supplier spare capacity.ASIA: While the index fell to a three-year low of -0.31, from -0.17 in July, the region still shows more resilience than the rest of the world.For more information, visit www.gep.com/volatilityNote: Full historic data dating back to January 2005 is available for subscription.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the tech industry, head directly to Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.According to Gartner, the IT sector is expected to grow by 5.5% between 2022 and 2023. This means that the global tech industry is set to generate $4.6 trillion in spending this year, despite the rising cost of living. Deloitte observed that while other industries have started to adjust to pre-pandemic levels, the technology industry is still riding the pandemic highs. A survey conducted by the firm showed that the top three concerns for the tech industry over the next couple of years include macroeconomic factors, workforce-related problems, and geopolitical uncertainties. Per the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, US companies that plan to manufacture their own chips could receive financial assistance by the government. This is a welcome change given the global constraint in the supply for chips in the world. However, how this would impact the existing supply-chain relationships in the industry remains to be seen. Deloitte also expects strategic decisions to be made, regarding acquisitions and divesting, to focus on core product lines. Don't Miss: Top 12 Undervalued Tech Stocks According to AnalystsAs per McKinsey, the introduction of AI has taken the tech industry by storm. As more technology companies now explore enhancing their services through generative AI, the sector is provided with countless opportunities for growth and development. As per McKinsey’s estimates, AI-based services are expected to contribute $4.4 trillion in economic value. In addition, the tech industry saw over $1 trillion in combined investments since 2022. While the industry is poised for growth, recruiting top talent remains a major constraint for firms. Over the last year, job postings in the technology sector have increased by 15%. Some of the major areas for growth include Applied AI, Software Development, Trust Architecture, and Digital Identity, as per the McKinsey report. Artificial intelligence is the new buzz, with different kinds of applications for consumers, businesses, and industries around the world. As of last year, over $104 billion was recorded in equity investment in Applied AI, while job postings increased by 6% between 2021 and 2022. Similarly, over $2 billion was invested during 2022 in softwares to improve different processes. Meanwhile, the job postings increased by 29% for developers between 2021 and 2022. As the industry looks set for yet another wave of digital transformation, there is a heightened need for security and safety for data management. In line with that, roughly $47 billion was invested during 2022 for building safe architecture to protect cloud-based data from cyber breaches. Story continuesAlso read: 10 Best Financial and Fintech ETFs To BuyAccording to Forbes, there are a few major trends in the tech industry. Given the rising costs of living and other challenges of managing the workforce, one shared goal is to improve operational efficiency through machine learning and artificial intelligence within businesses. Next, the industry is moving towards developing tools that require no code. This is going to be beneficial for businesses and consumers to address their tech requirements, without a need for any experience in coding. Artificial intelligence is expected to improve further, as it gets incorporated into decision making, content generation, and editing. Consequently, AI can also be used for innovation in car-based applications, such as self-driving cars. Recently, the healthcare sector has capitalized on technological innovation as the industry undergoes digital transformation. As more cloud-based solutions are offered for different industries to better manage business processes, the tech industry is set to optimize operations across multiple sectors. With this industry outlook in mind, let's take a look  at Goldman Sachs’ top stock picks in the tech sector, which include the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Our Methodology We used Goldman Sachs’ Q1 2023 portfolio and selected the 12 biggest positions in tech firms during the quarter for this list. We have mentioned Goldman Sachs’ stake value and the hedge fund sentiment towards each stock as of the first quarter of 2023. The list is ranked in the ascending order of the firm’s stake value in each holding. Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 12 Stock PicksSource:PixabayGoldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top Stock Picks12. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Goldman Sachs' Stake Value: $1,640,035,093Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 138Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is a global leader in providing payment solutions worldwide. It provides secure and seamless authorisation and processing of payments internationally. On July 27, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) announced a Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $2.89 and a revenue of $6.3 billion, which outperformed market expectations by $0.06 and $130 million, respectively. At the end of Q1 2023, Goldman Sachs held 4.5 million shares of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) worth $1.64 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 138 hedge funds were bullish on Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), as opposed to 139 in the previous quarter. Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management held the largest position in the company, with 5.8 million shares worth $2.13 billion. Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is one of the top tech stock picks of Goldman Sachs.LVS Advisory made this comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We have owned Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) on and off since inception. We re-initiated the position in summer 2022 during the broader market sell-off. The stock traded off to an attractive valuation and we believed the tailwinds from a reopening of international travel still had legs. This was a small portfolio position and the stock has appreciated in the year we have owned it. The stock’s valuation is once again rich and the tailwinds from international travel and consumer spending appear to be tapering. We sold the position because we believe other opportunities within our existing portfolio will generate superior returns.”11. Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS)Goldman Sachs' Stake Value: $1,793,493,600Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) is a cybersecurity company that specializes in providing secure access solutions to protect customers from cyberattacks, data breaches, and data loss. On July 25, BTIG analyst Gray Powell upgraded Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) stock from Neutral to Buy, with a price target of $185. The analyst highlighted that recent on-site assessments of SSE have shown a consistent and lasting enhancement. At the conclusion of Q1 2023, Goldman Sachs held 17 million shares of Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) valued at $1.79 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 38 hedge funds were bullish on Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS). This number was 42 during the previous quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors held a prominent stake in the company, with over 1 million shares worth $122.6 million. Artisan Global Discovery Fund had this to say about Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) provides cloud-based Internet security solutions. In the quarter, it announced 54% revenue growth and expected growth of nearly 40% in 2023 (ahead of expectations). Despite solid fundamental momentum, shares have underperformed this year as investors have grown concerned about slowing demand for enterprise software as the broader global economy slows. We believe the dual trends of rising security vulnerability and increased enterprise digitization will lead to sustained demand, even in a recession. Cybersecurity remains a top concern for businesses and governments alike as cyberattacks can have devastating financial and reputational consequences. Meanwhile, managing the security needs of legacy on-premise applications, a growing number of cloud-based applications (Office 365, Salesforce, etc.) and a more remote workforce (versus pre-pandemic) make operating IT infrastructures increasingly complex. Give the attractive long-term outlook and depressed valuations, we added to the position.”10. Cisco Systems, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We had one sale this quarter, exiting network equipment company Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO). We chose to use the proceeds on more attractive value opportunities as Cisco’s growth has come in below what we had hoped for, and the company is increasingly looking at M&amp;A to augment its growth rate.”9.

We trimmed several of the year’s winners on strength, including Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, CoStar Group, Inc. (CSGP), and CarMax.”8. MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc.

The company is led by a relatively new management team taking steps to accelerate topline growth and expand margins. The leadership team’s strategy is to addresses smaller, long-duration product cycle markets in which it can provide a differentiated offering, especially in compound semis such as GaAs, Al-GaAs, InP and GaN-on-SiC, using its design expertise and its US-trusted foundry / Department of Defense approved status. Rolling out several new, higher margin products and expanding into adjacent end markets such as auto and consumer should drive a compelling profit cycle in the periods ahead.”7. Splunk Inc.

(NASDAQ:SPLK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We exited our position in Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) during the quarter. A number of developments caused us to question whether Splunk’s competitive position was eroding. Splunk is a premium product, and less expensive alternatives have made progress increasing the quality of their offerings. Our research has confirmed Splunk is losing market share to these players, including Microsoft’s Sentinel. Sentinel has made a number of improvements over time and integrates with Microsoft’s other products. Notably, both of Splunk’s Co-Presidents left Splunk in 2022 to work for Microsoft. Splunk’s Chief Financial Officer left a few months later. Before the CFO left, Splunk lowered its annual recurring revenue guidance for the year. While the company attributed the change to the macro environment, we were unable to differentiate to what extent the slowdown was caused by the macro environment versus competitive factors. Based on our primary research and competitive concerns, we no longer had sufficient confidence in Splunk’s value stability. Splunk no longer qualifies for investment, and we exited the position.”6.

Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) or Mastercard, that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:10 Best Warehouse and Self-Storage Stocks To Buy10 Best Inexpensive Stocks To Buy Right Now10 Oversold Healthcare Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The US stock markets are undergoing a positive euphoria as several analysts have started to believe the much-anticipated recession everyone was worried about for about a year now might not happen after all. This is because the Federal Reserve’s fight against inflation is slowly but surely bearing some fruit. Inflation is declining and major research institutions which were vehemently predicting recession are having second thoughts. These positive developments are having a direct impact on the consumer discretionary sector, which suffered when dark clouds were hovering over the US economy and financial markets. When things go south, consumers cut back on discretionary spending and only spend on essential items, making consumer discretionary stocks worst performers when common households are not doing good. But as recession clouds abate and consumer confidence begins to rebound, consumer discretionary stocks are back in action.Deloitte published its State of the US Consumer report in July which shares some interesting insights that are directly linked to consumer spending and show what’s going on in US households when it comes to budget planning and spending. The report said that the percentage of respondents in the US who were concerned about their savings and who were delaying large purchases due to inflation fell in June, thanks to a clear fall in inflation. The report also said that “consumer spending intentions” rebounded in June after falling consistently for about a year. The Deloitte report retail sales jumped in May for the second straight month and they are already up about 31.6% from the pre-COVID levels.Last month, a Wall Street Journal report highlighted an important trend that adds another positive development in the latest cycle of positive news. The report said that for several months just a handful of companies were responsible for all the gains of the S&amp;P 500 index. But that trend is changing and major sectors are now adding to the broader market’s growth. Several stocks from the consumer discretionary sector were also noted to have added to the total market gains.Story continuesThe WSJ report said that over 140 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index have hit fresh 52-week highs since the end of May. Some of the notable companies from the consumer sector adding to these gains include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD).Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundswithGod/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor this article we first listed all the holdings of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund.

And then the question on how long do inflationary pressures persist, but — over the longer term, we believe we can achieve gradual improvement in profitability. I think if you get into like, are there any structural questions related to that? We’re seeing tangible benefit in freight cost, but we’re still — these costs still are not at pre-pandemic levels. And then we’re seeing some wage pressures in the stores. When you talk about — we’ve guided to CapEx of $810 million. So a big component of that in addition to distribution center capacity, in addition to investing in the 100 new stores, a big chunk of that is technology investments that will drive further efficiencies within the stores and in our distribution centers.So more automation in our distribution centers and some store initiatives that we’ve touched on in the past.Madison Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The bottom five contributors for the quarter were Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST), W.R. Berkley, Gartner, Glacier Bancorp, and Carlisle.

As a reminder, that includes revenue growth of 10% to 12%, global comp growth near the high end of 7% to 9% and solid margin expansion. Store growth, capital spend and tax rate guidance also remain unchanged from what we shared previously. As a reminder, we expect an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points on fiscal year 2023 revenue and earnings, respectively.With that, let me provide further detail around our Q4. First, in regard to International. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we expect our International segment Q4 margin to expand year-over-year but to be meaningfully lower than Q3 due to seasonality along with accelerated digital and store renovation investments. Second, in regard to China, as I noted earlier, we expect China’s average weekly sales to continue to sustain the growth quarter-over-quarter, resulting in average weekly sales growth of low to mid-single digits in Q4, with similar sized comp growth as the market is lapping government stimulus for customers and favorable discounting from prior year coupled with the timing of difference of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which all contributed to prior year transaction growth.”The London Company Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) – Sentiment on SBUX turned more negative in this uncertain macro environment with the impending return of student loan payments in the U.S. SBUX reported very strong results for the Jan-March quarter, but exercised caution by not raising guidance.

66,e4324bc9-efca-31e6-83c9-d69a884a1e01,SO,2023-08-14,7 Stocks to Buy Now to Beat the Inflation Blues,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-now-beat-222454212.html,1691447094,STORY,"['NEM', 'ACI', 'VLO', 'GOOGL', 'PRTS', 'SO', 'AWK']","[In June, annual inflation (from the most recent data) slipped to 3%, which on paper clashes with the concept of stocks to beat inflation. After all, NPR pointed out that the aforementioned statistic represented the lowest point since March 2021. That’s a sign that the Federal Reserve’s hawkish interest rate hiking campaign is making an impact.However, the main challenge with this thesis is the “core inflation” indicator, which strips out volatile food and energy prices. Unfortunately, this metric clocked in at 4.8% in June, well above the Fed’s target of 2%. At the time, analysts speculated that the central bank would raise rates again to combat price acceleration. It did just that, which seems to clash again with inflation-proof stocks.Nevertheless, the labor market remains robust, which is why investors should still buy stocks for inflation protection. True, the latest tally in July slipped against expectations. However, the unemployment rate also sank back to 3.5%, indicating labor sector resilience.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPut another way, more dollars continue to chase after fewer goods. So, you should beat inflation with stocks that might cynically rise in this heightened environment.Newmont (NEM)A pile of shining gold bars. Gold stocksSource: ShutterstockFrankly, the narrative for metals and mining giant Newmont (NYSE:NEM) as one of the stocks to beat inflation speaks for itself. Should inflation worsen, the commodities sector will almost surely benefit. Not only that, Newmont’s gold business should blossom. Historically, gold carries a reputation for being a safe-haven asset against inflationary pressures.Further, I appreciate that you can accrue some decent passive income with NEM. Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 3.91%. That’s noticeably above the materials sector’s average yield of 2.82%. Also, while the payout ratio isn’t the lowest, at 58.95%, investors shouldn’t fret too much about yield sustainability.Story continuesFinancially, Newmont could use some improvements as the company tackled the headwinds associated with the Covid-19 crisis and later the Fed’s hawkish monetary policy. Still, if the central bank can’t tackle elevated prices, NEM makes a compelling case for inflation-proof stocks.Southern Company (SO)the southern company logo displayed several times on a screenSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comA gas and electric utility holding firm, Southern Company (NYSE:SO) offers, in my opinion, a no-brainer for stocks to beat inflation. Basically, the case for SO comes down to its underlying natural monopoly. According to Southern’s public profile, it serves nine million customers. You’re not just going to come in and compete with this enterprise.Another fundamental catalyst for SO – and one you should pay attention to if you want to buy stocks for inflation protection – is the necessity of the business. Unlike a discretionary purchase like an overpriced latte at a fancy coffee shop, you must pay your bills. Otherwise, you suffer a ripple effect that could easily ruin your life.Lastly, investors seeking to beat inflation with stocks should earmark SO. Not only does it provide an indelible business, but it also offers robust passive income. Currently, Southern carries a forward yield of 4.13%, above the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%.American Water Works (AWK)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comAnother candidate for no-brainer ideas for stocks to beat inflation, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is a public utility that provides water and wastewater services in the U.S. Per its corporate profile, the company serves approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states. Overall, the underlying user base comes out to about 14 million through 3.4 million customer connections.Again, if you want to buy stocks for inflation protection, you’ve got to think cynically. You’re looking for businesses that no matter what people must engage. Obviously, holistic water-related services represent one of the most important. If you don’t believe me, don’t pay your water bills. Let’s see how quickly that steamrolls into one giant pile.Primarily, American Water is indelible so it doesn’t need that much coaxing as it relates to inflation-proof stocks. But as a bonus, the company also carries a forward yield of 1.99%. While it’s lower than the utility sector’s average yield, American Water Works also commands 14 years of consecutive annual dividend increases.Valero Energy (VLO)3D rendered two black oil barrels on digital financial chart screen with yellow numbers and rising, green, falling, red arrows on black background. Oil stocksSource: stockwars / Shutterstock.comA downstream energy specialist, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) focuses mostly on manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels. While the political and ideological narrative has shifted toward the electrification of mobility, the harsh reality is that electric vehicles are still too expensive for average households. Plus, inflation would likely force consumers to make do with what they have, not go out and buy replacement vehicles.With people stuck with their combustion-powered vehicles, Valero should benefit cynically. Therefore, I anticipate VLO to rise as one of the stocks to beat inflation. Yes, shares have only gained about 6% since the Jan. opener. However, over the trailing one-year period, they’re up nearly 21%. Another benefit to targeting Valero as one of the inflation-proof stocks centers on its passive income. Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 3.22%. It’s a bit lower than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. However, you must also factor in the low payout ratio of 30.9%.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comOff the top, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) might seem like a strange idea if you want to buy stocks for inflation protection. However, the owner of the massive Google ecosystem should thrive under a framework of rising or elevated prices. During difficulties, people look for different avenues to cope. And what better way to find information than through Google? After all, it dominates the global search engine market.Another fundamental factor that should lift GOOG as one of the stocks to beat inflation is its YouTube video content platform. With so much (free) information available there, you can practically pick up a doctorate degree or two in whatever subject you’re studying. Here, people searching for lifehacks to save money to tips on landing a dream job should translate to greater engagement. And that engagement leads to more advertising dollars.Plus, the company continues to benefit from solid revenue and EBITDA growth. As well, it’s consistently profitable with a trailing-year net margin of 21%. If you want to beat inflation with stocks, take a look at GOOG.Albertsons (ACI)Albertsons (ACI) store with logoSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWading into the riskier ideas for stocks to beat inflation, grocery giant Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) cuts a somewhat disappointing figure. Since the start of the year, ACI gained just a hair over 5%. During the trailing one-year period, shares slipped almost 20%. Nevertheless, the main fundamental catalyst of the trade-down effect should help invigorate sentiment.As a McKinsey &amp; Company report indicated earlier this year, consumers hurt by inflation are trading down. Basically, they’re forgoing expensive brands or stores for their lower-cost alternative. Eventually, I forecast you’ll see wholesale trade downs. In particular, people won’t be so eager to eat out at fancy restaurants. Instead, they’ll cook for themselves and their families.Also, while Albertsons presents significant risks, it also entices investors who want to buy stocks for inflation protection. Notably, the market prices ACI at a forward multiple of 7.76. As a discount to projected earnings, Albertsons ranks better than 96.83% of the defensive retail competition.CarParts.com (PRTS)A stack of auto partsSource: ShutterstockTo be upfront, online aftermarket auto parts provider CarParts.com (NASDAQ:PRTS) ranks among the riskiest ideas for stocks to beat inflation. It’s incredibly relevant because of the conditions impacting the consumer economy. However, since the Jan. opener, PRTS lost more than 28% of its equity value. During the trailing one-year period, PRTS gave up over 46%.At the same time, the fundamentals are aligning beautifully (albeit cynically) for CarParts.com. As data from S&amp;P Global Mobility showed, this year, the average age of passenger vehicles on U.S. roadways hit 12.5 years, a record. This dynamic confirms that people are hurting with higher prices. It’s not just “paper” pain. What’s more, the framework has a consequential effect on the auto parts industry. In other words, consumers are going to drive their incumbent vehicles until the wheels fall off. This factor alone should be a huge catalyst for PRTS. That’s why I’m including it on this list of inflation-proof stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

If you want to skip our primer on wide moat investing, then head on over to 5 Best Wide Moat Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Among the countless ways in which companies on the stock market are segregated, one way is classifying them according to wide moat or narrow moat. In a nutshell, wide moat stocks are firms that are believed to have significant competitive advantages that are expected to make them stand out from peers for more than a decade. For firms that do not have these advantages, the term is 'narrow moat', and naturally, most media and investor attention often focuses on the former grouping with several exchange traded funds listing these companies as part of their investments.This economic moat as it's called comes courtesy of no one else but Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Buffett is known for investing in firms that he believes have a sustained competitive advantage over their peers and then holding their stock for years to let the price appreciation accrue and make the investment grow in value. Mr. Buffett has been talking about wide moats for decades now, and one latest example of his reliance on the term came during a shareholder letter in 2017 where he described the advantage that the Government Employees Insurance Company or GEICO has due to its wide moat. According to him:GEICO’s low costs create a moat – an enduring one – that competitors are unable to cross. As a result, the company gobbles up market share year after year, ending 2016 with about 12% of industry volume. That’s up from 2.5% in 1995, the year Berkshire acquired control of GEICO. Employment, meanwhile, grew from 8,575 to 36,085.The term was repeated again on the next page, with economic moat investing being a crucial part of Berkshire's investment philosophy as the Oracle of Omaha shared:Berkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a range of business models protected by wide moats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset for Berkshire shareholders that time will only make more valuableStory continuesSo, what is an economic moat and how does it affect a company's competitive advantages? Well, these advantages can come through a strong product that makes switching costs high (think for example how Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s ecosystem makes it difficult for long time users to switch), having a low cost production advantage that competitors cannot keep up with, or have superior technology that competitors are unable to match (for instance, SpaceX's rockets are the only ones of their kind that can autonomously land, which provides the company with a great cost advantage as it does not have to make a new rocket for every launch).Naturally, a firm's management plays a crucial role in developing economic moats to reap years of advantages. Management can create economic moats by investing in new technologies, acquiring firms that have competitive technologies, and trimming down the hedges by removing unprofitable businesses or products and focusing on ones that can compete well in the market.Using these principles, we can also try to guess which firms have a wide moat that could help them in their industry for decades to come. Well, one notable example is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) which is one the largest electronic commerce retailers in the world. Amazon's moat comes through the popularity of its platform, which is a household name and the firm maintains its advantage by employing thousands of drivers and operating numerous fulfillment centers to ensure that a competitor does not have a chance of beating it in scale. Using scale as a criterion for a wide economic moat, another giant in the retailing industry, and one which might not see any serious rivals in the future unless it's due to its own mistakes, is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Walmart is the largest retailer in the world, with more than two million employees, more than ten thousand stores, and a unique competitive advantage where it offers consumers the lowest prices on everyday products to make sure they return every time.Before we get to our list of the best wide moat stocks that are favored by hedge funds, it'd make sense to replug Warren Buffett's wisdom here from 1999 when he commented:Move on to failures of airlines. Here's a list of 129 airlines that in the past 20 years filed for bankruptcy. Continental was smart enough to make that list twice. As of 1992, in fact--though the picture would have improved since then--the money that had been made since the dawn of aviation by all of this country's airline companies was zero. Absolutely zero. Sizing all this up, I like to think that if I'd been at Kitty Hawk in 1903 when Orville Wright took off, I would have been farsighted enough, and public-spirited enough--I owed this to future capitalists--to shoot him down. I mean, Karl Marx couldn't have done as much damage to capitalists as Orville did. I won't dwell on other glamorous businesses that dramatically changed our lives but concurrently failed to deliver rewards to U.S. investors: the manufacture of radios and televisions, for example.But I will draw a lesson from these businesses: The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors.So what are the wide moat stocks that hedge funds are buying? Some top picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).13 Best Wide Moat Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by David Martin on UnsplashOur Methodology To make our list of the best wide moat stocks that hedge funds are buying, we narrowed down the top 30 holdings of the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF and then selected the top 13 companies with the greatest number of hedge fund investors as of Q1 2023 end.Best Wide Moat Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds13.

72,798e6ae6-8663-3e8f-b8a0-54bfb8d7098e,PFE,2023-08-14,New Covid vaccines are on the way as 'Eris' variant rises,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/covid-vaccines-way-eris-variant-100000022.html,1692007200,STORY,"['PFE', 'MRNA', 'BNTX']","[By Michael ErmanNEW YORK, Aug 14 (Reuters) - A new COVID vaccine is due out next month, but health experts and analysts say it is likely to be coolly received even as hospitalizations from ""Eris"", a variant of the Omicron form of the coronavirus, rise around the country.Some public health experts hope that Americans will welcome the new shot as they would a flu jab. But demand for the vaccine has dropped sharply since 2021 when it first became available and more than 240 million people in the U.S., or 73% of the population, received at least one shot.In the fall of 2022, by which time most people had either had the COVID virus or the vaccine, fewer than 50 million people got the shots.Healthcare providers and pharmacies such as CVS Health will start next month to offer the shot, updated to fight the Omicron version of the virus that has been dominant since last year.They will be fighting declining concern about the virus, as well as fatigue and skepticism about the merits of this vaccine, Kaiser Family Foundation Director of Survey Methodology Ashley Kirzinger said.""Public health officials, if they want to see a majority of adults get these annual vaccines, they're going to have to make the case to the American public that COVID isn't over and it still poses a risk to them,"" Kirzinger said.The top reason vaccinated people gave in KFF surveys earlier this year for eschewing annual shots was they believed they had protection from the virus because of previous shots or infections, she said.COVID-19 vaccine makers have pared back expectations for this fall's vaccination campaign, with Pfizer – the largest maker of mRNA shots with BioNTech – recently warning that it might need to cut jobs if it does not do well. Its biggest rival, Moderna, conceded demand could be as few as 50 million shots.Last year, Pfizer and Moderna's vaccine sales topped $56 billion worldwide; analysts project around $20 billion for this year.Story continuesJefferies analyst Michael Yee said he does not expect the autumn campaign to reach last year's.""Take a look at what happened last winter. It was 50 million in the US, and it seems likely to be lower than that, given that there's less concern about COVID this year than last year,"" Yee said.POST PANDEMIC VACCINEThe COVID public health emergency ended in May and the government has handed much of the duty of vaccinating America to the private sector. Over 1.1 million people in the United States have died from COVID, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).CDC Director Mandy Cohen said last week in a podcast that she expects the shots - which still need to be authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and recommended by the CDC - to be rolled out in the third or fourth week of September. She suggested Americans should view these shots as an annual measure to protect oneself, in line with the annual flu shot.As with the flu, Pfizer/BioNTech SE, Moderna and Novavax, have created versions of the COVID vaccine to try to match the variant they believe will be circulating this fall. The shots are aimed at XBB.1.5, a subvariant that is similar to EG.5 and also a sub-lineage of the still dominant Omicron variant.COVID-19 related hospitalizations are up more than 40% off of recent lows hit in June, but are still more than 90% below peak levels hit during the January 2022 Omicron outbreak, according to CDC data.THE EVIDENCESome doctors suggest that annual shots should be targeted at the elderly and other high risk people, who are most likely to have dire outcomes if they catch COVID-19.Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University and a liaison to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization practices, said it is possible that the ACIP could make a weaker recommendation for younger, healthier people. That could also affect demand.""Should children really receive this booster?"" Schaffner said. ""Should the average person with no underlying illness who is a younger adult receive this vaccine or should this vaccine now be a more targeted vaccine?""The CDC recommended children get a single dose of last year's updated vaccine for those aged 6 and older.Dr. David Boulware, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Minnesota, said that according to research he has published, people who are boosted have less severe symptoms for a shorter duration.""When you look at what you can do to reduce your duration of illness, even if you do get sick, being boosted is going to be the best way to do that,"" he said.(Reporting by Michael Erman; editing by Caroline Humer and Diane Craft)]"

If you want to skip our primer on wide moat investing, then head on over to 5 Best Wide Moat Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Among the countless ways in which companies on the stock market are segregated, one way is classifying them according to wide moat or narrow moat. In a nutshell, wide moat stocks are firms that are believed to have significant competitive advantages that are expected to make them stand out from peers for more than a decade. For firms that do not have these advantages, the term is 'narrow moat', and naturally, most media and investor attention often focuses on the former grouping with several exchange traded funds listing these companies as part of their investments.This economic moat as it's called comes courtesy of no one else but Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Buffett is known for investing in firms that he believes have a sustained competitive advantage over their peers and then holding their stock for years to let the price appreciation accrue and make the investment grow in value. Mr. Buffett has been talking about wide moats for decades now, and one latest example of his reliance on the term came during a shareholder letter in 2017 where he described the advantage that the Government Employees Insurance Company or GEICO has due to its wide moat. According to him:GEICO’s low costs create a moat – an enduring one – that competitors are unable to cross. As a result, the company gobbles up market share year after year, ending 2016 with about 12% of industry volume. That’s up from 2.5% in 1995, the year Berkshire acquired control of GEICO. Employment, meanwhile, grew from 8,575 to 36,085.The term was repeated again on the next page, with economic moat investing being a crucial part of Berkshire's investment philosophy as the Oracle of Omaha shared:Berkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a range of business models protected by wide moats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset for Berkshire shareholders that time will only make more valuableStory continuesSo, what is an economic moat and how does it affect a company's competitive advantages? Well, these advantages can come through a strong product that makes switching costs high (think for example how Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s ecosystem makes it difficult for long time users to switch), having a low cost production advantage that competitors cannot keep up with, or have superior technology that competitors are unable to match (for instance, SpaceX's rockets are the only ones of their kind that can autonomously land, which provides the company with a great cost advantage as it does not have to make a new rocket for every launch).Naturally, a firm's management plays a crucial role in developing economic moats to reap years of advantages. Management can create economic moats by investing in new technologies, acquiring firms that have competitive technologies, and trimming down the hedges by removing unprofitable businesses or products and focusing on ones that can compete well in the market.Using these principles, we can also try to guess which firms have a wide moat that could help them in their industry for decades to come. Well, one notable example is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) which is one the largest electronic commerce retailers in the world. Amazon's moat comes through the popularity of its platform, which is a household name and the firm maintains its advantage by employing thousands of drivers and operating numerous fulfillment centers to ensure that a competitor does not have a chance of beating it in scale. Using scale as a criterion for a wide economic moat, another giant in the retailing industry, and one which might not see any serious rivals in the future unless it's due to its own mistakes, is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Walmart is the largest retailer in the world, with more than two million employees, more than ten thousand stores, and a unique competitive advantage where it offers consumers the lowest prices on everyday products to make sure they return every time.Before we get to our list of the best wide moat stocks that are favored by hedge funds, it'd make sense to replug Warren Buffett's wisdom here from 1999 when he commented:Move on to failures of airlines. Here's a list of 129 airlines that in the past 20 years filed for bankruptcy. Continental was smart enough to make that list twice. As of 1992, in fact--though the picture would have improved since then--the money that had been made since the dawn of aviation by all of this country's airline companies was zero. Absolutely zero. Sizing all this up, I like to think that if I'd been at Kitty Hawk in 1903 when Orville Wright took off, I would have been farsighted enough, and public-spirited enough--I owed this to future capitalists--to shoot him down. I mean, Karl Marx couldn't have done as much damage to capitalists as Orville did. I won't dwell on other glamorous businesses that dramatically changed our lives but concurrently failed to deliver rewards to U.S. investors: the manufacture of radios and televisions, for example.But I will draw a lesson from these businesses: The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors.So what are the wide moat stocks that hedge funds are buying? Some top picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).13 Best Wide Moat Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by David Martin on UnsplashOur Methodology To make our list of the best wide moat stocks that hedge funds are buying, we narrowed down the top 30 holdings of the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF and then selected the top 13 companies with the greatest number of hedge fund investors as of Q1 2023 end.Best Wide Moat Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds13.

The bottom line was this: After all the sacrifices the UAW made over the years, the days of rolling over were done. The bill was due.""I’ve been told I am crazy to raise member expectations this high as we head into bargaining,"" Fain said in his address. ""I refuse to allow employers, the billionaire class, and sellouts to play on our fears.""The stakes couldn't be higher for the UAW and the Big Three.The current contract ends on September 14, at which point a work stoppage could occur if they don't strike a deal. The negotiations, if Fain's speech was any indication, will be the most contentious in recent memory. Why? Fain and current UAW leadership believe the union has given up too much in the past.The increased rancor has already made a mark. Shares of GM, Ford, and Stellantis all dropped steeply last week, largely because Wall Street is concerned that a work stoppage would seriously impact automakers as they navigate a generational and costly electric transformation.'These demands aren’t going to happen'The demands set out by Fain and UAW leadership include ""substantial wage increases,"" which amount to a 46% rise over three years; eliminating compensation tiers for new and old workers (which the UPS Teamsters secured); restoring cost of living adjustments; providing a new pension plan; and reducing work weeks to 32 hours from the standard 40.Making such demands in public ahead of contract talks isn't typical for the UAW and the Big Three automakers.In the past, the UAW and Big Three went behind closed doors to negotiate after a contract was hammered out. The UAW then presented the proposed contract to its members for a vote.Story continuesPublicly releasing contract demands could backfire for the union, putting pressure on the leadership to avoid compromise and therefore up the likelihood of an impasse with the Big Three negotiators.No more Mr. Nice Guy: United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain outside the General Motors Factory Zero plant in Hamtramck, Mich., last month. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya.) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)But the tough-guy talk may be a plus: Fain, in essence, may be preparing the rank and file for a long, rough fight — a fight brought on by the costs facing the Big Three given these demands. According to Bloomberg, the cost of the UAW demands could amount to $80 billion over the course of the contract, which typically lasts three to four years.Fain's demands caught the automakers' leadership off guard.""Everyone understands these demands aren’t going to happen — it would be suicidal for the companies to agree to this,"" one industry source told Yahoo Finance.The UAW's wish list would amount to $25 billion-$30 billion per automaker over the life of the contract.""That adds $35 to $40 per hour to active labor cost — an increase of roughly 60%,"" the source said. The impact being that automakers would return to the ""bankruptcy era"" and more than double the labor costs for GM, Ford, and Stellantis versus non-union automakers like Tesla (TSLA).Less at stake because of its international blue print? The Chrysler Technology Center (Stellantis), in Auburn Hills, Mich. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)When reached for comment, a UAW spokesperson noted the industry source's take misrepresented a few key points.""The Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor estimates that labor is just 5.1% of the cost of the average vehicle. That's a very important data point to take into account when the automakers claim that our demands will be catastrophic,"" UAW spokesperson Jim McNeil said.McNeil also noted that the rising MSRPs of Big Three vehicles have not been driven by labor. ""[A recent study] published by the BLS shows that dealer markups have been driving up the costs of new cars, NOT labor costs.""Finally, McNeil pointed to a recent statement made by Fain talking about the costs borne by UAW workers over the past decade and a half.""Overall, the starting pay for a Big Three worker today is almost $21,000 less than it was in 2007 when adjusted for inflation,"" the statement said. ""UAW members made enormous sacrifices to save the automakers during the Great Recession, but we’ve never been made whole.""A strong sell from Wall Street: The GM Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)A 'good faith' processFor its part, Big Three leadership has been striking more of a conciliatory tone, at least publicly.GM President Mark Reuss recently told Yahoo Finance that GM is negotiating a deal ""that works for everybody in good faith.”Meanwhile, Ford Chairman Bill Ford has said that the UAW isn’t the ""enemy"" and that he wants to find common ground.But Stellantis, which just this week saw Fain throw its contract proposal into the trash in another Facebook Live video, said the UAW needs to focus on ""reality.""""[The UAW] demands could endanger our ability to make decisions in the future that provide job security for our employees,"" Stellantis North America COO Mark Stewart said in a statement to employees, according to Reuters. ""This is a losing proposition for all of us.""Wall Street waryWall Street, it seems, is anticipating the worst.Last week CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson double-downgraded GM to Strong Sell and slashed his price target to $28 from $40. Nelson wrote in a client note, ""the growing risk of a UAW strike, given reports that the company and union remain extremely far apart in labor negotiations ... [and] newly-elected UAW President Shawn Fain appears to be aggressive and eager to make his mark with the Detroit Three.""Nelson also said that the last UAW strike in 2019, which lasted 40 days, impacted GM’s earnings by $1.89 a share.""GM and Ford may be in the penalty box for"" a while: United Auto Workers members walk in the Labor Day parade a few years back.(AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Morningstar automotive analyst David Whiston echoed those concerns, particularly for GM and Ford, which are more tied to the UAW compared to Stellantis, which has a bigger international labor presence.""GM and Ford may be in the penalty box for a while. Wall Street hates uncertainty,"" Whiston said. ""This is not a normal negotiation, both in style and the demands they are asking.""""This is a different time,"" longtime Detroit Free Press automotive writer Eric Lawrence told Yahoo Finance.""The union is talking in terms that they probably haven't talked in a long time. They've kind of come out swinging. They've kind of put the automakers on notice, and they've told the workers that they expect to fight for a lot of this contract.""Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The US stock markets are undergoing a positive euphoria as several analysts have started to believe the much-anticipated recession everyone was worried about for about a year now might not happen after all. This is because the Federal Reserve’s fight against inflation is slowly but surely bearing some fruit. Inflation is declining and major research institutions which were vehemently predicting recession are having second thoughts. These positive developments are having a direct impact on the consumer discretionary sector, which suffered when dark clouds were hovering over the US economy and financial markets. When things go south, consumers cut back on discretionary spending and only spend on essential items, making consumer discretionary stocks worst performers when common households are not doing good. But as recession clouds abate and consumer confidence begins to rebound, consumer discretionary stocks are back in action.Deloitte published its State of the US Consumer report in July which shares some interesting insights that are directly linked to consumer spending and show what’s going on in US households when it comes to budget planning and spending. The report said that the percentage of respondents in the US who were concerned about their savings and who were delaying large purchases due to inflation fell in June, thanks to a clear fall in inflation. The report also said that “consumer spending intentions” rebounded in June after falling consistently for about a year. The Deloitte report retail sales jumped in May for the second straight month and they are already up about 31.6% from the pre-COVID levels.Last month, a Wall Street Journal report highlighted an important trend that adds another positive development in the latest cycle of positive news. The report said that for several months just a handful of companies were responsible for all the gains of the S&amp;P 500 index. But that trend is changing and major sectors are now adding to the broader market’s growth. Several stocks from the consumer discretionary sector were also noted to have added to the total market gains.Story continuesThe WSJ report said that over 140 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index have hit fresh 52-week highs since the end of May. Some of the notable companies from the consumer sector adding to these gains include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD).Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundswithGod/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor this article we first listed all the holdings of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund.

(NASDAQ:ROST)’s management, in a question on its plans to recapturing margins of pre-COVID times, said:""Our long-term operating margin improvements are to be highly dependent on us delivering strong sales over a sustained period of time. And then the question on how long do inflationary pressures persist, but — over the longer term, we believe we can achieve gradual improvement in profitability. I think if you get into like, are there any structural questions related to that? We’re seeing tangible benefit in freight cost, but we’re still — these costs still are not at pre-pandemic levels. And then we’re seeing some wage pressures in the stores. When you talk about — we’ve guided to CapEx of $810 million. So a big component of that in addition to distribution center capacity, in addition to investing in the 100 new stores, a big chunk of that is technology investments that will drive further efficiencies within the stores and in our distribution centers.So more automation in our distribution centers and some store initiatives that we’ve touched on in the past.Madison Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The bottom five contributors for the quarter were Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST), W.R. Berkley, Gartner, Glacier Bancorp, and Carlisle.

As it relates to our remaining guidance, we are pleased to reaffirm full year guidance on all other measures. As a reminder, that includes revenue growth of 10% to 12%, global comp growth near the high end of 7% to 9% and solid margin expansion. Store growth, capital spend and tax rate guidance also remain unchanged from what we shared previously. As a reminder, we expect an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points on fiscal year 2023 revenue and earnings, respectively.With that, let me provide further detail around our Q4. First, in regard to International. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we expect our International segment Q4 margin to expand year-over-year but to be meaningfully lower than Q3 due to seasonality along with accelerated digital and store renovation investments. Second, in regard to China, as I noted earlier, we expect China’s average weekly sales to continue to sustain the growth quarter-over-quarter, resulting in average weekly sales growth of low to mid-single digits in Q4, with similar sized comp growth as the market is lapping government stimulus for customers and favorable discounting from prior year coupled with the timing of difference of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which all contributed to prior year transaction growth.”The London Company Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) – Sentiment on SBUX turned more negative in this uncertain macro environment with the impending return of student loan payments in the U.S. SBUX reported very strong results for the Jan-March quarter, but exercised caution by not raising guidance.

The United States recently upped its plans to borrow more money, a move that resulted in soaring treasury yields. The Federal Reserve has continued raising interest rates in an effort to beat inflation, but rising gas prices can indicate more inflation is around the corner. More inflation means more rate hikes.While issues like rising gas prices will resolve themselves once the temperature gets cooler, rising prices add another layer of macroeconomic uncertainty. These uncertainties, combined with recent bank defaults, have resulted in a 2% year-to-date gain for the iShares S&amp;P 500 Financials Sector fund (OCTMKTS:ISRUF).These unimpressive gains don’t look good for the banking industry, but some investors view economic uncertainty as an opportunity to get their favorite stocks at lower prices. If you are that type of investor, consider loading up on these three top bank stocks before macroeconomic conditions improve.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCapital One (COF)capital one (COF) logo outside of corporate buildingSource: Isabelle OHara/Shutterstock.comUnlike most bank stocks, Capital One (NYSE:COF) has performed well this year, earning a 22% year-to-date gain for investors. The company reported $1.4 billion in net income in the second quarter.Although this number represents a year-over-year decline, the stock still trades at a reasonable 9 P/E ratio. Capital One is one of the larger banks in the industry, with a $43 billion market cap and $444.2 billion in assets under management at the end of 2022. Warren Buffett’s $1 billion investment in Capital One is also giving shareholders another reason to be optimistic.Capital One stock currently has a price-to-book ratio under 1 and a dividend yield above 2%. The annualized dividend is currently $2.40.In the Q2 press release, CEO and founder Richard D. Fairbank stated that the company’s modern technology infrastructure has expanded the bank’s opportunities. These investments can help the bank continue to deliver for shareholders.Story continuesComerica (CMA)A sign for Comerica (CMA) bank in California.Source: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.comComerica (NYSE:CMA) has not yet returned to its March 2023 price. Shares are down by over 20% from that price point. Other banks have recovered or parried more of their losses from that point.However, the company’s second-quarter results indicate a rally can be in the cards. Comerica reported $273 million in net income which marked a 4.6% year-over-year improvement. Also, revenue was up by 8.8% year-over-year. Another quarter of net recoveries enables excellent credit quality and suggests the stock can command a higher price in the future.Shares would have to leap by 25% to retain their early March levels before the Silicon Valley Bank news broke out. The stock has an attractive 5.50 P/E ratio and a 5.30% dividend yield for investors who accumulate shares now. Comerica has been a slog for investors over the past five years. But a short-term opportunity exists for investors who want a high margin of safety.PNC Financial (PNC)PNC bank logo on buildingSource: Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comPNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) is down by roughly 15% from its March starting point. The company recently released its Q2 results, showing $1.5 billion in net income. Although the year-over-year increase is minimal (less than 1%), higher net income can help the stock get closer to its March levels.PNC Financial also announced a dividend hike. The quarterly payment will go from $1.50 per share to $1.55 per share. This payment went out to shareholders on August 5th and represents a 3.3% year-over-year increase in the dividend.New PNC Financial investors will end up with a dividend yield closing at 5%. PNC Financial has $325 billion in assets under management.Just like Comerica, PNC Financial hasn’t been the most rewarding stock to own over the past five years, but it presents a decent margin of safety at the current price level.On this date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

83,f7c82623-aa69-3668-8914-f21dbdfab0d9,TGT,2023-08-14,Walmart and Target are part of Zacks Earnings Preview,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-target-part-zacks-earnings-102700552.html,1692008820,STORY,"['WMT', 'TGT', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – August 14, 2023 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart WMT and Target TGT.Retail Earnings Looming: What to ExpectWalmart and Target shares lost roughly a quarter of their value in response to the disappointing April-quarter results on May 17th and 18th, 2022.Leading up to May 2022, these two stocks had performed roughly in line with each other, with Walmart slightly doing better than Target and both outperforming in the S&amp;P 500 index.Target shares never got their mojo back after the May 2022 beating and have actually lost ground in response to each of the following four quarterly releases. Walmart shares have had the opposite behavior, with the stock steadily gaining ground following subsequent quarterly releases.This performance context is important to keep in mind as we look ahead to the Target and Walmart quarterly results this week, the former before the market's open on Wednesday, August 16th, and Walmart the day after on Thursday morning (August 17th).Walmart's quarterly EPS estimates coming into this report have been very stable, with the current Zacks Consensus of $1.67 per share unchanged over the past two months. Unlike Walmart, there has been notable pressure on Target estimates, with analysts cutting their estimates on continued near-term challenges. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for Target of $1.49 is down from $1.57 a month ago, $1.58 two months ago, and $1.94 three months back.The stability in Walmart shares makes intuitive sense, as its core business offers a high degree of defense during periods of economic instability and uncertainty. Walmart's 'value orientation' allows it to gain market share as relatively better-off consumers 'trade down' during times of 'economic stress.'One key point of differentiation between these two retail giants is Walmart's bigger grocery business which gives its results greater stability given the 'staply' nature of that otherwise low-margin business. The relatively low-margin nature of groceries notwithstanding, they bring in foot traffic and are also responsible for the aforementioned 'trade down' phenomenon that is helping Walmart gain share.Story continuesAnalysts see relatively greater momentum in Walmart's business on the back of higher average selling prices and flat traffic, gains on the e-commerce side, and better margin results relative to what they reported last on May 18th. Target is seen as suffering from weak traffic during the period, with the price trend only marginally positive.Both companies struggled with evolving consumer behavior as the pandemic entered the rearview mirror. We saw this in their April 2022 quarterly results that we referenced at the top of this note, for which the market punished them.While both took drastic steps to steady their floundering ships, Walmart clearly did a better job adjusting to the new environment than Target. The 'shrinkage' aspect of inventory was also front and center when Target put a dollar number on the phenomenon the last time around. However, market participants appreciate that this aspect of 'inventory shrink' is hardly restricted to Target.With respect to the Retail sector 2023 Q2 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 19 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the realm in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor's standard industry classification.The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon (AMZN) and restaurant players. The 19 Zacks Retail companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have reported Q2 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.Total Q2 earnings for these 19 retailers that have reported are up +49% from the same period last year on +8.3% higher revenues, with 78.9% beating EPS estimates and 52.6% beating revenue estimates.The online players and restaurant operators easily beat earnings expectations but struggled with beating revenue estimates.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group's performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 19 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon's Q2 earnings were up +526% on +10.8% higher revenues, beating top-and-bottom-line expectations.As we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.One recurring theme in the Q2 earnings season has been the continued resilience and stability of the U.S. consumer. We heard this from the banks, the leisure and hospitality players, and consumer-facing digital operators.There is undoubtedly stress at the lower end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. Other issues, like the resumption of student loan payments, are seen as weighing on spending trends. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.We will hear more about that on the Walmart and Target earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods. But on the whole, consumer spending trends remained intact in 2023 Q2, and these results will reconfirm.Q2 Earnings ScorecardAs of Friday, August 11th, we have seen Q2 results from 457 S&amp;P 500 members, or 91.4% of the index's total membership. The Q2 reporting cycle has now come to an end for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors.We have more than 300 companies reporting results this week, including 17 S&amp;P 500 members. The notable companies reporting this week include, besides the aforementioned Walmart and Target, include Home Depot, Cisco Systems, Applied Materials, Deere &amp; Co.Total Q2 earnings for the 457 S&amp;P 500 members are down -9.5% from the same period last year on +0.48% higher revenues, with 79% beating EPS estimates and 65.2% beating revenue estimates.The Earnings Big Picture Please note that the -8.2% decline for Q2 earnings on -0.2% lower revenues is the blended growth picture for the quarter, which combines the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies.Q2 is on track to be the third quarter in a row of earnings declines and the first quarter of declining revenues. As noted earlier, a big part of the earnings and revenue weakness is due to the Energy sector.Excluding the Energy sector drag, Q2 earnings would be down -2.1% on +4.6% higher revenues.2023 Q2 will be the 6th consecutive quarter of declining margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Margins in Q2 are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest margin pressures expected to be in the Energy, Medical, Basic Materials, and Construction sectors.With the earnings focus lately on the Tech sector, it is instructive to see how much distance has been covered on the margins front in this key sector.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Tech Sector's Earnings Outlook Reflects Improvement  Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

(DE).The July retail sales report is due out Tuesday morning while the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting will be released Wednesday afternoon. Yahoo Finance will also feature a week-long special, Retail Evolution: The New Era, during our livestreaming programming beginning Monday morning.Last week, markets were mixed as August's lackluster trading continued during the month's first full week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) continued trudging higher, rising 0.6% on the week while the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both closed the week in the red. The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 enter the third week of August at their lowest levels in a month.Last week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed headline inflation's rapid cooldown took a pause in July, rising 3.2% last month after increasing 3% in June.But economists came away from the report focused on monthly price increases remaining low for the second straight month.On a monthly basis, core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy categories, increased 0.2% in July, the same increase as in June. That marked the first time since February 2021 that core CPI rose just 0.2% in consecutive months.""This month's soft core print confirms the disinflationary process,"" Morgan Stanley chief US economist Ellen Zentner wrote after the report on Thursday. ""After 6 months of 0.4% [month-over-month] prints, a second 0.16% [month-over-month increase] comes as a sign of continued deceleration.""Most Wall Street economists now see the Fed holding interest rates steady at its next meeting in September.Story continues""The Fed is attempting to fine tune the policy path as it gets close to the end of the hiking cycle and does not want to short-circuit the business cycle if inflation is already moving towards target,"" Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen wrote on Friday.The firm now expects the Fed will raise rates in November as opposed to next month, writing, ""An additional six weeks would give the Fed more time to assess the trajectory of the economy.""As of Friday afternoon, markets were pricing in a roughly 89% chance that the Fed holds steady at its September meeting, up from a 72% chance on July 11, per data from CME Group.The minutes from the Fed's July meeting, which will offer additional insight into how Fed officials see the future path of policy, are set for release at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday.Retail in focusFrom ""Barbie"" and Taylor Swift to economists pushing back or eliminating recession calls, a resilient consumer has been the story of the economy during the summer of 2023.Corporate results from major banks and some airlines have told a similar story too. There has been a slowdown, but in large part the consumer continues to spend more than most investors and economists had expected, leading to surprising growth in the American economy. This week will provide more key details on how Americans are spending and, more importantly, if companies think a second-half consumer slowdown is materializing.The July retail sales report is expected at 8:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday with economists anticipating sales increased 0.4% over the prior month. Retail sales increased 0.2% in June.""We expect a robust July sales report,"" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave wrote on Thursday, citing the company's credit and debit card data which showed spending was strong during the July 4 holiday. ""We forecast above-consensus increases of 0.7% and 0.6% in the Census Bureau's July figures for retail sales ex-autos and the core control group, respectively.""On the corporate side, investors will be looking to see if some of the cracks that appeared in the retail space three months ago have widened.In May, Home Depot warned consumers were completing smaller projects at home and buying fewer big-ticket items. Meanwhile, Target said its discretionary business, which includes items like technology and clothes, had begun to lag.Customers shop at a Walmart store on May 18, 2023, in Chicago, Illinois.

(DE).The July retail sales report is due out Tuesday morning while the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting will be released Wednesday afternoon. Yahoo Finance will also feature a week-long special, Retail Evolution: The New Era, during our livestreaming programming beginning Monday morning.Last week, markets were mixed as August's lackluster trading continued during the month's first full week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) continued trudging higher, rising 0.6% on the week while the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both closed the week in the red. The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 enter the third week of August at their lowest levels in a month.Last week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed headline inflation's rapid cooldown took a pause in July, rising 3.2% last month after increasing 3% in June.But economists came away from the report focused on monthly price increases remaining low for the second straight month.On a monthly basis, core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy categories, increased 0.2% in July, the same increase as in June. That marked the first time since February 2021 that core CPI rose just 0.2% in consecutive months.""This month's soft core print confirms the disinflationary process,"" Morgan Stanley chief US economist Ellen Zentner wrote after the report on Thursday.

There has been a slowdown, but in large part the consumer continues to spend more than most investors and economists had expected, leading to surprising growth in the American economy. This week will provide more key details on how Americans are spending and, more importantly, if companies think a second-half consumer slowdown is materializing.The July retail sales report is expected at 8:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday with economists anticipating sales increased 0.4% over the prior month. Retail sales increased 0.2% in June.""We expect a robust July sales report,"" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave wrote on Thursday, citing the company's credit and debit card data which showed spending was strong during the July 4 holiday. ""We forecast above-consensus increases of 0.7% and 0.6% in the Census Bureau's July figures for retail sales ex-autos and the core control group, respectively.""On the corporate side, investors will be looking to see if some of the cracks that appeared in the retail space three months ago have widened.In May, Home Depot warned consumers were completing smaller projects at home and buying fewer big-ticket items.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The US stock markets are undergoing a positive euphoria as several analysts have started to believe the much-anticipated recession everyone was worried about for about a year now might not happen after all. This is because the Federal Reserve’s fight against inflation is slowly but surely bearing some fruit. Inflation is declining and major research institutions which were vehemently predicting recession are having second thoughts. These positive developments are having a direct impact on the consumer discretionary sector, which suffered when dark clouds were hovering over the US economy and financial markets. When things go south, consumers cut back on discretionary spending and only spend on essential items, making consumer discretionary stocks worst performers when common households are not doing good. But as recession clouds abate and consumer confidence begins to rebound, consumer discretionary stocks are back in action.Deloitte published its State of the US Consumer report in July which shares some interesting insights that are directly linked to consumer spending and show what’s going on in US households when it comes to budget planning and spending. The report said that the percentage of respondents in the US who were concerned about their savings and who were delaying large purchases due to inflation fell in June, thanks to a clear fall in inflation. The report also said that “consumer spending intentions” rebounded in June after falling consistently for about a year. The Deloitte report retail sales jumped in May for the second straight month and they are already up about 31.6% from the pre-COVID levels.Last month, a Wall Street Journal report highlighted an important trend that adds another positive development in the latest cycle of positive news. The report said that for several months just a handful of companies were responsible for all the gains of the S&amp;P 500 index. But that trend is changing and major sectors are now adding to the broader market’s growth. Several stocks from the consumer discretionary sector were also noted to have added to the total market gains.Story continuesThe WSJ report said that over 140 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index have hit fresh 52-week highs since the end of May. Some of the notable companies from the consumer sector adding to these gains include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD).Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundswithGod/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor this article we first listed all the holdings of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund.

(NASDAQ:ROST)’s management, in a question on its plans to recapturing margins of pre-COVID times, said:""Our long-term operating margin improvements are to be highly dependent on us delivering strong sales over a sustained period of time. And then the question on how long do inflationary pressures persist, but — over the longer term, we believe we can achieve gradual improvement in profitability. I think if you get into like, are there any structural questions related to that? We’re seeing tangible benefit in freight cost, but we’re still — these costs still are not at pre-pandemic levels. And then we’re seeing some wage pressures in the stores. When you talk about — we’ve guided to CapEx of $810 million. So a big component of that in addition to distribution center capacity, in addition to investing in the 100 new stores, a big chunk of that is technology investments that will drive further efficiencies within the stores and in our distribution centers.So more automation in our distribution centers and some store initiatives that we’ve touched on in the past.Madison Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The bottom five contributors for the quarter were Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST), W.R. Berkley, Gartner, Glacier Bancorp, and Carlisle. Sales trends at Ross Stores remain so-so, with flattish sales compared to a year ago. The low-to-moderate income consumer has started to struggle as stimulus payments and government support initiatives from the COVID period are wearing off, and inflation is eating away at purchasing power.”14. MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Hospitality and entertainment company MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) ranks 14th in our list of the best consumer discretionary stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

MGM is seeing continued strength at its Vegas properties and now has the tailwind of China’s domestic re-opening for its Macau properties. This is one of our largest positions, and we remain confident in this portfolio of businesses and IAC’s ability to allocate capital.”13. Caesars Entertainment, Inc.

The company offers a wide range of travel shopping and reservation services, as well as provides real-time access to schedule, pricing and availability information for airlines, hotels and car rental companies. Expedia serves customers worldwide.We see Expedia benefiting from the growth of booking travel online, both for leisure and in corporate travel. The company also benefits from rapid growth in alternative accommodations, vacation home rental, through VRBO. The main sources of revenue and profitability are from hotel and vacation home rental. Additionally Expedia has exposure to airline ticket sales and automobile rentals. Post the COVID-19 pandemic, Expedia’s debt has been reduced and share repurchase has resumed and we would expect a dividend to be reinstated.”11. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.

As it relates to our remaining guidance, we are pleased to reaffirm full year guidance on all other measures. As a reminder, that includes revenue growth of 10% to 12%, global comp growth near the high end of 7% to 9% and solid margin expansion. Store growth, capital spend and tax rate guidance also remain unchanged from what we shared previously. As a reminder, we expect an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points on fiscal year 2023 revenue and earnings, respectively.With that, let me provide further detail around our Q4. First, in regard to International. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we expect our International segment Q4 margin to expand year-over-year but to be meaningfully lower than Q3 due to seasonality along with accelerated digital and store renovation investments. Second, in regard to China, as I noted earlier, we expect China’s average weekly sales to continue to sustain the growth quarter-over-quarter, resulting in average weekly sales growth of low to mid-single digits in Q4, with similar sized comp growth as the market is lapping government stimulus for customers and favorable discounting from prior year coupled with the timing of difference of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which all contributed to prior year transaction growth.”The London Company Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) – Sentiment on SBUX turned more negative in this uncertain macro environment with the impending return of student loan payments in the U.S. SBUX reported very strong results for the Jan-March quarter, but exercised caution by not raising guidance. SBUX is beginning to realize tailwinds from the re-opening of the Chinese economy, adding a buffer to growth and margins for the remainder of the year.”6.

To skip our detailed analysis of the banking sector in 2023, you can go directly to see the 5 Cheap Bank Stocks To Buy Before They Take Off.Moody's Rating Actions On US BanksOn August 7, Moody's announced its rating actions on 27 US banks. These included the downgrades of 10 banks, while six other banks were placed on review for possible downgrades, and the outlooks of 11 other banks were changed from stable to negative. The credit rating agency considered several factors, including the banks' second-quarter earnings releases, interest rate risks, and more, in coming to these decisions. According to Moody's, the second quarter results for most banks in the US showed that they were suffering from growing profitability pressures, which the agency believes is likely to reduce their ability to generate internal capital. At the same time, the threat of a mild US recession, expected to hit in early 2024, also influenced the rating decisions.While several smaller and regional banks made the list of downgraded banks, some bigger names such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) managed to avoid landing the list. However, this is not true for every big bank in the country. Additionally, CNBC's Power Lunch on August 8 noted something of interest to investors looking at bank stocks today. CNBC reporter Leslie Picker said the following:""The major issues that the ratings agency flagged have been pretty well telegraphed since Moody's' prior round of actions for the regionals in the spring. Even as equity investors have been willing to look past some of the major industry headwinds, bond and options investors have not been quite as sanguine.""Why Now?The fact that Moody's decided to make this move now may signify that the agency is trying to tell banks that while there has been a ""quiet summer"" on the banking front so far, ""we may not be out of the woods quite yet."" Picker also noted that these negative rating actions were not anticipated by the market at all. On why the move came this month, Picker said the following:Story continues""Why now? We've seen the bulk of the earnings releases from the regionals at this point in time. So I think they were able to, you know, collate a bunch of the balance sheets, income statements, and draw some conclusions based on that.""The Moody's rating action is an additional setback for the banking and financial sector so far this year. Since the start of 2023, the banking sector has been struggling to retain its position in the market. The collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and some other banks have already dented the industry.  In light of this, the valuations of many major banks have dropped, which is a development that seems to have spooked many individuals in the market. At the same time, opportunistic investors are looking at the current situation of bank stocks as something they can profit from, considering the fact that well-established bank stocks that are usually much more expensive per share are now trading at lower valuations. This can thus be seen as the best time to pick up bank stocks at an attractive bargain. Considering the above, we have compiled a list of bank stocks to buy before they take off. They include some small bank stocks to buy alongside bigger names in the banking and financial sector.11 Cheap Bank Stocks To Buy Before They Take OffPhoto by Mikel Parera on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds and picked 11 most popular bank stocks among hedge funds with the lowest PE ratios.Cheap Bank Stocks To Buy Before They Take Off11.

Particularly with respect to duration risk, MTB was an outlier in its conservatism with respect to buying shorter-term securities in a very low rate environment.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the tech industry, head directly to Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.According to Gartner, the IT sector is expected to grow by 5.5% between 2022 and 2023. This means that the global tech industry is set to generate $4.6 trillion in spending this year, despite the rising cost of living. Deloitte observed that while other industries have started to adjust to pre-pandemic levels, the technology industry is still riding the pandemic highs. A survey conducted by the firm showed that the top three concerns for the tech industry over the next couple of years include macroeconomic factors, workforce-related problems, and geopolitical uncertainties. Per the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, US companies that plan to manufacture their own chips could receive financial assistance by the government. This is a welcome change given the global constraint in the supply for chips in the world. However, how this would impact the existing supply-chain relationships in the industry remains to be seen. Deloitte also expects strategic decisions to be made, regarding acquisitions and divesting, to focus on core product lines. Don't Miss: Top 12 Undervalued Tech Stocks According to AnalystsAs per McKinsey, the introduction of AI has taken the tech industry by storm. As more technology companies now explore enhancing their services through generative AI, the sector is provided with countless opportunities for growth and development. As per McKinsey’s estimates, AI-based services are expected to contribute $4.4 trillion in economic value. In addition, the tech industry saw over $1 trillion in combined investments since 2022. While the industry is poised for growth, recruiting top talent remains a major constraint for firms. Over the last year, job postings in the technology sector have increased by 15%. Some of the major areas for growth include Applied AI, Software Development, Trust Architecture, and Digital Identity, as per the McKinsey report. Artificial intelligence is the new buzz, with different kinds of applications for consumers, businesses, and industries around the world. As of last year, over $104 billion was recorded in equity investment in Applied AI, while job postings increased by 6% between 2021 and 2022. Similarly, over $2 billion was invested during 2022 in softwares to improve different processes. Meanwhile, the job postings increased by 29% for developers between 2021 and 2022. As the industry looks set for yet another wave of digital transformation, there is a heightened need for security and safety for data management. In line with that, roughly $47 billion was invested during 2022 for building safe architecture to protect cloud-based data from cyber breaches. Story continuesAlso read: 10 Best Financial and Fintech ETFs To BuyAccording to Forbes, there are a few major trends in the tech industry. Given the rising costs of living and other challenges of managing the workforce, one shared goal is to improve operational efficiency through machine learning and artificial intelligence within businesses. Next, the industry is moving towards developing tools that require no code. This is going to be beneficial for businesses and consumers to address their tech requirements, without a need for any experience in coding. Artificial intelligence is expected to improve further, as it gets incorporated into decision making, content generation, and editing. Consequently, AI can also be used for innovation in car-based applications, such as self-driving cars. Recently, the healthcare sector has capitalized on technological innovation as the industry undergoes digital transformation. As more cloud-based solutions are offered for different industries to better manage business processes, the tech industry is set to optimize operations across multiple sectors. With this industry outlook in mind, let's take a look  at Goldman Sachs’ top stock picks in the tech sector, which include the likes of Amazon.com, Inc.

At the end of Q1 2023, Goldman Sachs held 4.5 million shares of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) worth $1.64 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 138 hedge funds were bullish on Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), as opposed to 139 in the previous quarter. Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management held the largest position in the company, with 5.8 million shares worth $2.13 billion. Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is one of the top tech stock picks of Goldman Sachs.LVS Advisory made this comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We have owned Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) on and off since inception. We re-initiated the position in summer 2022 during the broader market sell-off. The stock traded off to an attractive valuation and we believed the tailwinds from a reopening of international travel still had legs. This was a small portfolio position and the stock has appreciated in the year we have owned it. The stock’s valuation is once again rich and the tailwinds from international travel and consumer spending appear to be tapering. We sold the position because we believe other opportunities within our existing portfolio will generate superior returns.”11. Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS)Goldman Sachs' Stake Value: $1,793,493,600Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) is a cybersecurity company that specializes in providing secure access solutions to protect customers from cyberattacks, data breaches, and data loss.

(NASDAQ:ZS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) provides cloud-based Internet security solutions. In the quarter, it announced 54% revenue growth and expected growth of nearly 40% in 2023 (ahead of expectations). Despite solid fundamental momentum, shares have underperformed this year as investors have grown concerned about slowing demand for enterprise software as the broader global economy slows. We believe the dual trends of rising security vulnerability and increased enterprise digitization will lead to sustained demand, even in a recession. Cybersecurity remains a top concern for businesses and governments alike as cyberattacks can have devastating financial and reputational consequences. Meanwhile, managing the security needs of legacy on-premise applications, a growing number of cloud-based applications (Office 365, Salesforce, etc.) and a more remote workforce (versus pre-pandemic) make operating IT infrastructures increasingly complex. Give the attractive long-term outlook and depressed valuations, we added to the position.”10. Cisco Systems, Inc.

We trimmed several of the year’s winners on strength, including Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, CoStar Group, Inc. (CSGP), and CarMax.”8. MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc.

The company is led by a relatively new management team taking steps to accelerate topline growth and expand margins. The leadership team’s strategy is to addresses smaller, long-duration product cycle markets in which it can provide a differentiated offering, especially in compound semis such as GaAs, Al-GaAs, InP and GaN-on-SiC, using its design expertise and its US-trusted foundry / Department of Defense approved status. Rolling out several new, higher margin products and expanding into adjacent end markets such as auto and consumer should drive a compelling profit cycle in the periods ahead.”7. Splunk Inc.

(NASDAQ:SPLK) is a provider of cloud services, software based solutions, and cybersecurity worldwide.

A number of developments caused us to question whether Splunk’s competitive position was eroding. Splunk is a premium product, and less expensive alternatives have made progress increasing the quality of their offerings. Our research has confirmed Splunk is losing market share to these players, including Microsoft’s Sentinel. Sentinel has made a number of improvements over time and integrates with Microsoft’s other products. Notably, both of Splunk’s Co-Presidents left Splunk in 2022 to work for Microsoft. Splunk’s Chief Financial Officer left a few months later. Before the CFO left, Splunk lowered its annual recurring revenue guidance for the year. While the company attributed the change to the macro environment, we were unable to differentiate to what extent the slowdown was caused by the macro environment versus competitive factors. Based on our primary research and competitive concerns, we no longer had sufficient confidence in Splunk’s value stability. Splunk no longer qualifies for investment, and we exited the position.”6. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Goldman Sachs' Stake Value: $3,533,157,774Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 173Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is one of the market leaders in providing payment solutions across the globe.

We are FINTECH investors, and we define Fintech as “anything utilizing technology to improve an established process.” We realize that half of Fintech is financial, but we don’t invest in traditional, credit sensitive banks. Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) or Mastercard, that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:10 Best Warehouse and Self-Storage Stocks To Buy10 Best Inexpensive Stocks To Buy Right Now10 Oversold Healthcare Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for KLA The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At KLAThe Executive VP, Mary Wilkinson, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$320 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$479). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 21% of Mary Wilkinson's holding.Insiders in KLA didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like KLA better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of KLAMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. KLA insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$101m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At KLA Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded KLA shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the KLA insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

Des Moines residents and visitors will now be able to use a full 140 MHz of spectrum, greatly increasing the 5G bandwidth available to serve customers throughout Des Moines. This allows Verizon to more quickly expand and enhance its 5G Ultra Wideband network, providing much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services, as well as enable higher data speeds. This additional spectrum will also allow Verizon to offer 5G Home broadband and Business Internet services to more customers throughout Des Moines, where Verizon’s network already ranks as the best performing according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®. *“Early access to the remainder of the C-band spectrum puts us another four months ahead of schedule from our original projections. This additional spectrum will make 5G Ultra Wideband available to even more Americans, and will open up more availability of our home and business broadband solutions,” said Joe Russo, EVP &amp; President of Global Networks and Technology for Verizon. “The more spectrum we deploy on our network, the more capacity we add for our customers to connect.”Since Verizon began deploying 5G service using C-band spectrum, the lightning fast 5G service has been made available to more than 222 million people in 359 markets* and more than 40 million households have access to Verizon’s Home Internet with 384,000 new customers subscribing to Verizon’s Fixed Wireless Access based home internet products (both LTE and 5G) in the second quarter of this year alone, bringing total FWA customers to 2.3 million.Story continuesVerizon’s C-band holdingsVerizon won C-Band licenses for between 140-200 MHz in all available markets, and began deploying 60 MHz in the first 46 areas in 2022. As the additional spectrum has been cleared by satellite companies outside of the first 46 areas, Verizon has been able to deploy 5G Ultra Wideband using a portion of its licensed bandwidth in many more markets coast to coast. Now, with final clearance from the satellite incumbents, Verizon will be able to use the entirety of its licensed C-band spectrum, an average of 161 MHz coast to coast with some markets accessing a full 200 MHz. Verizon has been deploying equipment that is capable of the full 200MHz of bandwidth, so with a mere software update, customers will start to see the effects of this dramatic increase in bandwidth in the immediate next few days and weeks.Specifically, Verizon now has access to:A minimum 140 megahertz of total spectrum in the contiguous United States and an average of 161 megahertz nationwide; that’s bandwidth in every available market, 406 markets in all.Up to 200 megahertz in 158 mostly rural markets covering nearly 40 million people. This will further enhance Verizon’s broadband solution portfolio for rural America.More service in more placesAccelerated access to best-in-class spectrum holdings means greater capacity and faster speeds in major metro areas where Verizon’s network is already undefeated in 96.8% of the metro drive tests (121 out of 125 markets) performed by the most rigorous scientific testing company** in the first half of 2023.

Oklahoma residents and visitors will now be able to use a full 180 MHz of spectrum, tripling the 5G bandwidth available to serve customers throughout Oklahoma. This allows Verizon to more quickly expand and enhance its 5G Ultra Wideband network, providing much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services, as well as enable higher data speeds. This additional spectrum will also allow Verizon to offer 5G Home broadband and Business Internet services to more customers throughout Oklahoma.“Early access to the remainder of the C-band spectrum puts us another four months ahead of schedule from our original projections. This additional spectrum will make 5G Ultra Wideband available to even more Americans, and will open up more availability of our home and business broadband solutions,” said Joe Russo, EVP &amp; President of Global Networks and Technology for Verizon. “The more spectrum we deploy on our network, the more capacity we add for our customers to connect.”Since Verizon began deploying 5G service using C-band spectrum, the lightning fast 5G service has been made available to more than 222 million people in 359 markets* and more than 40 million households have access to Verizon’s Home Internet with 384,000 new customers subscribing to Verizon’s Fixed Wireless Access based home internet products (both LTE and 5G) in the second quarter of this year alone, bringing total FWA customers to 2.3 million.Verizon’s C-band holdingsVerizon won C-Band licenses for between 140-200 MHz in all available markets, and began deploying 60 MHz in the first 46 areas in 2022.

101,df32000d-ce44-3343-a649-9036505be47e,TPR,2023-08-14,Tapestry (TPR) to Acquire Capri Holdings in a $8.5B Cash Deal,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tapestry-tpr-acquire-capri-holdings-091400659.html,1692004440,STORY,"['CPRI', 'TPR', 'AEO', 'BOOT']","[Luxury lifestyle retailer Tapestry, Inc. TPR has been making smart moves to enrich customer experience. In the latest development, it announced plans to acquire Versace and Jimmy Choo parent company, Capri Holdings Limited CPRI. The deal, which is likely to conclude in the next calendar year, will unite the six distinctive iconic brands into a powerful global house of luxury portfolio. The acquisition looks to accelerate Tapestry’s strategic agenda and create a significant value opportunity.We note that the total enterprise value of the aforesaid deal is nearly $8.5 billion or $57.00 per share. The $57 per share value is equivalent to a premium of roughly 59% to the 30-day volume weighted average price on Aug 9, 2023, whereas the $8.5 billion represents a 9x adjusted EBITDA multiple on a trailing twelve-month basis or 7x with estimated synergies.This all-cash deal, which has been approved unanimously by both the companies’ board of directors, is subjected to the approval of CPRI’s shareholders. However, the pending transaction is not subject to a financing condition. The purchase price will be funded by senior notes, term loans and Tapestry cash, a part of which is to be used to pay down Capri Holdings’ current outstanding debt.Importantly, Tapestry, which is also the owner of Coach, unveiled plans to suspend its share repurchase program to prioritize deleveraging through debt reduction. This will help the company to achieve a leverage ratio of below 2.5x debt/EBITDA in 24 months after the closure of the deal. TPR looks forward to reaching a long-term leverage target of under 2.5x debt/EBITDA. On a positive note, the company’s board has approved a 17% hike to its quarterly dividend per share, reaching a payout of $1.40 per share or nearly $325 million in fiscal 2024.More DetailsThe blend of Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman along with Versace, Jimmy Choo, and Michael Kors into a new global luxury house with unique opportunities will boost the stakeholders’ value. Markedly, the combined company delivered global annual sales of more than $12 billion and approximately $2 billion in adjusted operating profit in the preceding fiscal year with a vast presence in more than 75 countries.Story continuesThe newly formed company will enhance the portfolio and diversification across consumer segments, geographies and product categories; leverage the acquirer’s consumer engagement platform to boost the direct-to-consumer capabilities; offer opportunity to create significant cost synergies; maximize shareholder returns; generate sturdy cash flows; and make continued progress as a people-centered organization.The combined company is likely to generate financial returns, such as double-digit earnings per share (EPS) accretion on an adjusted basis and compelling ROIC, accretive to TPR’s existing standalone total shareholder returns plan, and boost capital returns. The combination is expected to realize above $200 million in run-rate cost synergies in three years after the closure of the deal, buoyed by operating cost savings and supply-chain efficiency.The acquisition deal will develop Tapestry’s portfolio into a $200+ billion global luxury market for handbags, accessories, footwear and apparel categories as well as widen product offerings via higher penetration of lifestyle categories like footwear and ready-to-wear.Tapestry’s three-year roadmap to drive sustainable top and bottom-line gains and generate significant cash flows to enhance shareholder value, appears positive. The company’s 2025 Growth Strategy focuses on four priorities, which include customer acquisition, retention, and reactivation; product innovation and excellence; robust omnichannel experience; and balanced growth across regions, principally its largest markets, North America and China; and harness opportunities in under-penetrated regions such as Southeast Asia and Europe.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe note that Tapestry’s shares have lost 18.5% in the past three months against the industry’s 8.2% rise.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Jim Chanos' 5 Short Positions in 2023.Investment manager Jim Chanos has made a name for himself on Wall Street by taking bold short positions even when the market seems to be in an uptrend. True to his trading strategy, the famed short seller took a swipe at the market early in the year, reiterating that valuation levels had run out of hand. He targeted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which was on a roll amid the AI boom, and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), a company he believes faces an uncertain future due to its reliance on the Chinese market.Best known for predicting the collapse of the energy group Enron, Chanos raised concerns that the market was not in a position to overcome the rising interest rate environment. He also raised concerns over the risk of falling corporate profitability. Chanos noted that the market expected corporate profits to rise by 12% this year and inflation dropping to 2% amid the aggressive interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve.When the famed Wall Street hedge fund manager, who founded Kynikos Associates in 1985, made these claims, the S&amp;P 500 was up by about 5%, bouncing after a 19% loss in 2022. While things were not as expensive as the previous year, the hedge fund manager reiterated they were not cheap, as the market was at 18 times forward earnings and profit margins were at all-time highs.“I’ve been on the Street [since] 1980 [and] not one bear market has ever traded above nine times to 14 times the previous peak earnings,” the Chanos &amp; Co. founder told CNBC’s “Fast Money” earlier this month.Chanos has reiterated his concerns on whether the bullish scenario will hold. The legendary short seller remains short a number of counters after an impressive 2022 when his short-only fund Ursus beat the overall market. The fund gained 18%  against a 19% loss for the S&amp;P 500.Story continuesJim Chanos' 10 Short Positions in 2023Jim Chanos also shared his thoughts on the real estate sector. He believes the office sector continues to be troubled, especially in big cities. Consequently, he has raised several hundred million dollars to take short positions on US-listed real estate investment trusts.According to the short seller, legacy data centers led by Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE:DLR) and Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) face growing competition from tech giants. As Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), the largest tenants of data centers, resort to building their own data centers, Chanos believes REITS with big exposure to data centers will be in trouble.In addition to commercial real estate, Chanos has been skeptical about cryptocurrency, in particular Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), which he believes faces stiff competition. He has also taken aim at the excessive hype around artificial intelligence as investors continue to pile on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) on the belief they are well poised to cash in on the disruptive technology.Our methodologyWith the forward price to earnings of the S&amp;P 500 above 18x, Chanos believes any reversion to the mean as earnings deflate will result in significant stock price declines. For this article we scanned Chanos' Q1'2023 portfolio and picked 10 stocks in which he initiated PUT options this year.10. Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD)Value of Put Option: $294,213 Year to Date Decline: 35%Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) is a financial services company offering a platform allowing people to invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options, gold, and cryptocurrencies. While the stock is up by about 35% year to date, it remains under pressure in the aftermath of Google parent Alphabet dumping nearly 90% of its shares in the trading app.The selloff comes as the user base in the Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) trading platform continues to shrink, fueling revenue concerns. The stock is already down by 86% from its all-time high, a drop that has allowed the likes of Chanos to generate significant returns through their Put trades in the stock.9. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Value of Put Option: $351,870 Year to Date Gain: 76%In recent years Jim Chanos has been skeptical about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). Early last year, the short seller raised doubts about the ride-sharing company’s ability to become EBITDA positive.Despite the concerns, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has been in fine form, rallying by 33% from when Chanos called the stock out. It is also up by about 76% year to date.8. Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG)Value of Put Option: $615,114 Year to Date Decline: 14%Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) faces an uncertain future amid the growing risk of recession. The company which develops and sells motorcycles has been under pressure going as the stock has dipped about 14% year to date.In a recession, customers are unlikely to spend on discretionary purchases such as motorcycles. Likewise, Chanos remaining confident of a US recession explains why he is short on Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG).7. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)Value of Put Option: $823,824 Year to Date Gain: 14%Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) shares have gained in the second half of 2023 amid strong Q2 results. With management expecting demand for machines to be high amid growth in nonresidential construction in North America, the stock could continue rallying, putting Chanos and other short sellers under pressure on the Put trades on the stock.6. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Value of Put Option: $986,012 Year to Date Gain: 28%Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) was battered last year amid a Chinese government crackdown on tech giants and the ongoing tussle between the US and China over semiconductors. Fast forward, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) has bounced back in 2023, rallying by more than 28%, year to date, even as Chanos remains bearish on the stock.Even though Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is down by 20% from its 2022 peak, it’s been in fine form as it benefits from growing hype around companies developing chips for the AI revolution. Click to continue reading and see Jim Chanos' 5 Short Positions in 2023. Suggested articles:Wall Street Analysts Trim Price Targets for These 10 Stocks10 Energy Stocks with Insider Buying12 Stocks That Will Benefit From AIDisclosure: None. Jim Chanos' 10 Short Positions in 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Top tech names such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) are teetering on 10% drops for the month. Mighty Microsoft's (MSFT) stock — for all the company's AI sizzle and love affair with OpenAI — is off by 4% in August. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has shed 2.1%.The only big-name tech stock working higher this month is Amazon (AMZN) (up 4%) — maybe because it's reportedly tracking whether workers back in the office are actually working. More productivity means more profits for Amazon (maybe), and there's nothing investors love more.The pullback in tech coincides with the 10-year Treasury yield rising from about 3.95% in late July to above 4.1% today. Yields back in early April were around 3.3%, for perspective.Blame Fitch's US credit rating downgrade prior to an avalanche of US debt issuances or the retrenchment in inflation sending cash into higher risk areas of markets. Whatever it is, higher yields could be here to stay for the time being, and that spells bad news for tech investors.Treasury yields may have not yet topped out. (RenMac) (RenMac)In fact, there is chatter on the Street that yields may have further room to run.""Despite rising odds that the Fed will pause at the September meeting, yields remain firm. Without taking any factors into account and just looking at the chart, yields do not look like a top to us and look poised to retest the highs from 2022. The 10 and 30-year have been making higher highs and higher lows since April and we’d need to see at least a lower low before suggesting a top may be in place,"" the strategy team at RenMac wrote in a new client note.The old rule of thumb is that tech stocks don't like a land of elevated yields. Higher borrowing costs, more attractive returns on cash, and more aggressive discounts on future growth are all part of the challenge facing tech highfliers when interest rates rise.Story continues""Our view is these higher rates, as we stay above the 4% level, will serve to put a cap on further valuation expansion. This had been a key driver of stock returns this year,"" astute market watcher Keith Lerner at Truist told me.""Already stocks are trading at the highest valuation level of the past 20 years, outside of the pandemic overshoot, which coincided with the Federal Funds rate at zero as opposed to above 5% today and a 10-year yield below 1%,"" Lerner added.Tread carefully, tech fans — at least until yields back up to below 4%.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

107,145c76dc-cce8-3096-907a-b4aa77fd9296,NVDA,2023-08-14,14 Hot Penny Stocks On the Move,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/14-hot-penny-stocks-move-134527390.html,1691934327,STORY,"['TMPO', 'FBEC', 'NVDA']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 14 hot penny stocks on the move. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Hot Penny Stocks On the Move.The US stock market enjoyed huge gains in 2023 first on the back of a tech rally that again pushed tech stock valuations to uneasy levels which also caused many analysts and experts to issue warnings on high valuations and unfounded market euphoria. Then, recently, the Federal Reserve’s fight against inflation started to show signs of success.  This led to several stocks making moves and gaining value.Nvidia's ""Penny Stock Moment""Some major, stable companies earlier this year posted gains that surprised many and had analysts looking for the real catalysts behind these gains. For example, Kirkoswald Asset Management’s Diana Amoa, according to a report from Bloomberg, called the frenzy around NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares a result of “FOMO.” The analyst said that markets “ don’t know what to do with equities.” Bloomberg called NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s rise after its earnings in May a “penny stock” moment. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s gains came after the company gave a remarkable guidance on the back of expectations that the popularity of generative applications like ChatGPT would increase demand for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s chips which are often powering AI software applications.While Amoa reportedly acknowledged at the time that investors were piling into stocks they think are sustainable, she said that it was hard to say whether valuations were truly based on fundamentals. The analyst said part of the reason behind such huge stock gains was investors’ wish to not miss out on the winners.The same Bloomberg report also quoted JPMorgan Asset Management’s Phil Camporeale, who said at the time that overall it’s not a good idea to be underweight S&amp;P 500. However, the analyst said at the time that he was advising people to invest in companies that can outlast the tough financial conditions as he believed “there is no way” the Fed would ease up on monetary policies “any time soon.” Time did prove Phil Camporeale’s claim as the Federal Reserve has been consistently raising interest rates and now investors are keenly looking at what the central bank’s move might be, especially after clear signs that inflation is declining in the US.Story continuesAs investors begin to open their wallets for risky bets amid the start of a bullish tide, penny stocks are gaining attention.  Every once in a while we hear in the news how some penny stock went big and surpassed all expectations, leaving investors only hoping that they’d have found this gem before it became famous. For example, a small penny-stock company called Cyberlux Corp. made news earlier this year when it received orders for special drones from the Pentagon to be used in the Russia-Ukraine war. While the stock has gone nowhere it’s always useful to keep in mind the importance of momentum in stock investing. That’s why in this article we will take a look at some penny stocks that are currently on the move. But why is it a good strategy to keep a check on stocks on the move?A 2010 research paper from AQR Research quoted a study which showed links between positive stock movement, growth rates and long-term growth prospects. Here’s what the paper said:“So, a firm that has a big positive shock to returns provides a signal to investors that the long-term growth prospects of the firm's cash flows have improved. Thus, the long-term expected return to the firm will also increase accordingly. This provides a positive relationship between the past return of the firm and its future long-term expected return or discount rate. In other words, momentum. Berk, Green, and Naik (1999) show that economic risk factors can have a persistent effect when firms face growth opportunities and this can give rise to momentum. In a similar model, Sagi and Seasholes (2007) argue that if the market value of the firm increases faster than the revenue of the firm, this will cause a link between growth rates and firm risk, giving rise to a momentum effect where past returns predict future expected returns due to risk.”Hot Penny Stocks On the MovePhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash Our MethodologyFor this article, we simply used Yahoo Finance’s stock screener which listed the most active penny stocks as of August 5.

While still small, B2B sales grew strongly in the double-digits in China last year despite difficult conditions out there and we look for another strong year in 2023. In fact, the number of our markets reporting B2B activity in 2022 was 22 markets. In total, we added 50 retail chain customers around the world. As you may imagine, selling products into retail chain is a very different proposition from operating a direct selling distribution model. As such, we are building a new consumer-facing company within our legacy direct-selling consumer push company. Perhaps, no better showcase for our growth strategy was the success we had in Korea last year. Korea is among the most advanced markets in the process of building an omni-channel ecosystem.In 2022, Korea surpassed Indonesia, our third largest market in the Asia Pacific region, behind China and Malaysia. In total, Korea grew 16% last year in constant currency as core sales increase in middle single-digits and B2B expansion, particularly in TV shopping added over 10 percentage points to growth. We are learning from this success and are sharing best practices in many markets around the world throughout this 2023. While it’s still early days, these initiatives help validate that our growth strategy to expand the consumer access to our products beyond the direction of distribution channel. Third, the new product introductions. We had many successful product introductions over the past couple of years that really gained traction last year.”8. Tempo Automation Holdings, Inc.

""It starts people thinking.""Iger fueled the conjecture last week during Disney's third-quarter earnings call with investors, when he said the company is mulling strategic partnerships for its marquee sports brand, ESPN, and has received ""notable interest,"" though Disney planned to retain control.The three businesses that will drive the greatest growth over the next five years, he said, are the company's film studios, theme parks and streaming video.One top media executive envisioned Iger spinning off the ABC broadcast network, local TV stations and Disney's cable networks such as Disney Channel or FX as a separate company, loading it with an appropriate level of debt.Another veteran media executive predicted Disney would spin off the television asset to its shareholders as a separate, publicly traded company by 2024, with private equity potentially playing a role.A fourth media executive who has run traditional and digital media companies said Disney may need to attract outside investors in ESPN so that it can competitively bid for increasingly expensive sports media rights, such as for NBA games, which expire after the 2024-25 season.Story continuesThat would potentially free up cash for Disney to acquire NBCUniversal's stake in Hulu, assuming full ownership of the streaming service next year. Under an agreement reached in 2019, NBCU parent Comcast can require Disney to buy the Hulu stake, or Disney can require NBCUniversal to sell it, as early as January 2024, at a market value of at least $5.8 billion.Disney declined to comment.THE 'FULL BEWKES'The fourth executive, along with other senior media figures who spoke with Reuters, said Iger is likely crafting options, retaining ownership of ESPN, with the opportunity to shed it in the future to position Disney as a more attractive acquisition target.The executive likened the strategy to one executed by former Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes, who sold off parts of the media conglomerate's business before selling its core film and television unit to AT&amp;T in an $85.4 billion deal that closed in 2018, said the veteran executive.""You sell the parts, then sell what's left,"" said the veteran. ""That's the full-Bewkes.""That may well be Iger's end-game, these executives speculated. To make it attractive for the only likely buyers big enough to digest a Disney - Apple or Alphabet's Google - Iger would need to prune Disney down to just the parts that preserve its global intellectual property portfolio, while separating out its cash-generating legacy businesses like TV.""There's no way a FAANG company is going to buy his company when he has all these cable channels, a broadcast network and a cable sports network,"" said the executive, using an acronym for the five major U.S. technology companies, Facebook (now Meta), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. ""It's not the business they're in, and it's unlikely the government would ever allow it.""Amazon, fresh off its $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM last year, would not likely be interested in such a deal, said one source familiar with the matter. And Facebook is not viewed as interested in traditional media assets.Needham and Co analyst Laura Martin floated the investor appeal of Apple acquiring Disney, writing in March that the combination of great content and strong distribution would create value. This idea continues to circulate in Hollywood.""Obviously, anyone who wants to speculate about these things would have to immediately consider the global regulatory environment,"" Iger said, when asked about the possibility during the investor call. ""I'll say no more than that. It's just - it's not something that we obsess about.""In that, he may be alone.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Kenneth Li and Richard Chang)]"

If you want to skip our primer on wide moat investing, then head on over to 5 Best Wide Moat Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Among the countless ways in which companies on the stock market are segregated, one way is classifying them according to wide moat or narrow moat. In a nutshell, wide moat stocks are firms that are believed to have significant competitive advantages that are expected to make them stand out from peers for more than a decade. For firms that do not have these advantages, the term is 'narrow moat', and naturally, most media and investor attention often focuses on the former grouping with several exchange traded funds listing these companies as part of their investments.This economic moat as it's called comes courtesy of no one else but Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Buffett is known for investing in firms that he believes have a sustained competitive advantage over their peers and then holding their stock for years to let the price appreciation accrue and make the investment grow in value. Mr. Buffett has been talking about wide moats for decades now, and one latest example of his reliance on the term came during a shareholder letter in 2017 where he described the advantage that the Government Employees Insurance Company or GEICO has due to its wide moat. According to him:GEICO’s low costs create a moat – an enduring one – that competitors are unable to cross. As a result, the company gobbles up market share year after year, ending 2016 with about 12% of industry volume. That’s up from 2.5% in 1995, the year Berkshire acquired control of GEICO. Employment, meanwhile, grew from 8,575 to 36,085.The term was repeated again on the next page, with economic moat investing being a crucial part of Berkshire's investment philosophy as the Oracle of Omaha shared:Berkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a range of business models protected by wide moats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset for Berkshire shareholders that time will only make more valuableStory continuesSo, what is an economic moat and how does it affect a company's competitive advantages? Well, these advantages can come through a strong product that makes switching costs high (think for example how Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s ecosystem makes it difficult for long time users to switch), having a low cost production advantage that competitors cannot keep up with, or have superior technology that competitors are unable to match (for instance, SpaceX's rockets are the only ones of their kind that can autonomously land, which provides the company with a great cost advantage as it does not have to make a new rocket for every launch).Naturally, a firm's management plays a crucial role in developing economic moats to reap years of advantages. Management can create economic moats by investing in new technologies, acquiring firms that have competitive technologies, and trimming down the hedges by removing unprofitable businesses or products and focusing on ones that can compete well in the market.Using these principles, we can also try to guess which firms have a wide moat that could help them in their industry for decades to come. Well, one notable example is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) which is one the largest electronic commerce retailers in the world. Amazon's moat comes through the popularity of its platform, which is a household name and the firm maintains its advantage by employing thousands of drivers and operating numerous fulfillment centers to ensure that a competitor does not have a chance of beating it in scale. Using scale as a criterion for a wide economic moat, another giant in the retailing industry, and one which might not see any serious rivals in the future unless it's due to its own mistakes, is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Walmart is the largest retailer in the world, with more than two million employees, more than ten thousand stores, and a unique competitive advantage where it offers consumers the lowest prices on everyday products to make sure they return every time.Before we get to our list of the best wide moat stocks that are favored by hedge funds, it'd make sense to replug Warren Buffett's wisdom here from 1999 when he commented:Move on to failures of airlines. Here's a list of 129 airlines that in the past 20 years filed for bankruptcy. Continental was smart enough to make that list twice. As of 1992, in fact--though the picture would have improved since then--the money that had been made since the dawn of aviation by all of this country's airline companies was zero. Absolutely zero. Sizing all this up, I like to think that if I'd been at Kitty Hawk in 1903 when Orville Wright took off, I would have been farsighted enough, and public-spirited enough--I owed this to future capitalists--to shoot him down. I mean, Karl Marx couldn't have done as much damage to capitalists as Orville did. I won't dwell on other glamorous businesses that dramatically changed our lives but concurrently failed to deliver rewards to U.S. investors: the manufacture of radios and televisions, for example.But I will draw a lesson from these businesses: The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors.So what are the wide moat stocks that hedge funds are buying? Some top picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).13 Best Wide Moat Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by David Martin on UnsplashOur Methodology To make our list of the best wide moat stocks that hedge funds are buying, we narrowed down the top 30 holdings of the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF and then selected the top 13 companies with the greatest number of hedge fund investors as of Q1 2023 end.Best Wide Moat Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds13.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please also note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Alexia Quadrani, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Alexia Quadrani: Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Company's third quarter 2023 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript will also be made available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Lansberry, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Kevin, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.Robert Iger: Thanks, Alexia, and good afternoon. In the eight months since I returned, we've undertaken an unprecedented transformation at Disney and this quarter's earnings reflect some of what we have accomplished. First, the company was completely restructured, restoring creativity to the center of our business. We made important management changes and efficiency improvements to create a more cost-effective, coordinated and streamlined approach to our operations. We aggressively reduced costs across the enterprise and we're on track to exceed our initial goal of $5.5 billion in savings. And perhaps most importantly, we've improved our DTC operating income by roughly $1 billion in just three quarters, as we continue to work toward achieving DTC profitability by the end of fiscal 2024.Story continuesI'm pleased with how much we've gotten done in such a short period of time, but I also know we have a lot more to do. Before I turn the call over to Kevin Lansberry, our Interim CFO, I'd like to elaborate on the state of our company and the transformative work we are still undertaking. As I've said before, our progress will not always be linear. But despite near-term headwinds, I'm incredibly confident in Disney's long-term trajectory because of the work we've done, the team we have in place and because of Disney's core intellectual property foundation. Moving forward, I believe three businesses will drive the greatest growth and value creation over the next five years. They are our film studios, our parks business and streaming, all of which are inextricably linked to our brands and franchises.Looking to Disney Entertainment studios, we're focused on improving the quality of our films and on better economics, not just reducing the number of titles we release but also the cost per title. And we're maximizing the full impact of our titles by embracing the multiple distribution windows at our disposal, enabling consumers to access their content in multiple ways. For example, Avatar: The Way of Water, which is now the third highest grossing film of all time, is also on track to be the biggest ever electronic home video release for Disney domestically. Certain other titles will be sold in the download-to-own window as well. By focusing on big franchises and tentpole films, we're able to generate interest in our existing library. For example, we're seeing tremendous engagement on Disney+ with the previous Guardians of the Galaxy films, the original Avatar and the first four Indiana Jones movies.But the value of our Disney entertainment studios and the reason this will be a key growth business for us extends far beyond our library and new releases. What sets Disney apart are the numerous ways we're able to reach consumers with the stories and characters they love, including in our parks and resorts. We'll be opening new Frozen theme lands at Hong Kong Disneyland and Walt Disney Studios Park in Paris as well as the Zootopia theme land at Shanghai Disney Resort. And later down the road, we will be bringing an Avatar experience to Disneyland, reinforcing the unrivaled worldwide appeal of our brands and franchises. Our Parks and Experience segment overall has had an impressive streak and will continue to be a key growth engine for the company, even as we navigate the cycles that come with operating this business.Our Cruise Line in particular showed strong revenue and operating income growth in the third quarter. Current Q4 booked occupancy for our existing fleet of five ships is at 98% and we will be expanding our fleet by adding two more ships in fiscal '25 and another in fiscal '26, nearly doubling our worldwide capacity. In addition to our Cruise Line, strong segment results for the quarter were driven by solid performance at our international parks, and we also saw continued strength at Disneyland Resort. Our Asia parks have been doing exceptionally well, reinforcing a clear opportunity for continued growth. Both Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland have experienced stronger-than-expected recoveries from the pandemic. And in Q3, they both grew meaningfully in revenue, operating income and attendance.We saw softer performance at Walt Disney World from the prior year, coming off our highly successful 50th anniversary celebration. Also as post-COVID pent-up demand continues to level off in Florida, local tax data shows evidence of some softening in several major Florida tourism markets. And the strong dollar is expected to continue tamping down international visitation to the state. However, Walt Disney World is still performing well above pre-COVID levels, 21% higher in revenue and 29% higher in operating income compared to fiscal 2019, adjusting for Starcruiser accelerated depreciation. And following a number of recent changes we've implemented, we continue to see positive guest experience ratings in our theme parks, including Walt Disney World and positive indicators for guests looking to book future visits.This includes strong demand for our newly returned annual passes. We're making numerous investments globally to grow our parks business over the next five years, and I'm very optimistic about the future of this business over the long term. The third area that will drive growth and value creation for Disney is our direct-to-consumer business. When you consider our path to profitability in streaming, it's important to remember where we started and how we've adapted based on what we've learned. We overachieved with massive subscriber growth for Disney+ out of the gate and we leaned into a spending level to fuel subscriber growth, which had been the key measure of success for many. All of this happened while we were still determining the right strategies for pricing, marketing, content and specific international market investments.However, since my return, we've reset the whole business around economics designed to deliver significant, sustained profitability. We're prioritizing the strength of our brands and franchises. We're rationalizing the volume of content we make, what we spend and what markets we invest in. We're deploying the technology necessary to both improve the user experience as well as the economics of this business. We're harnessing windowing opportunities, perfecting our pricing and marketing strategies, maximizing our enormous advertising potential and we're making extensive Hulu content available to bundle subscribers via Disney+. As I announced last quarter, we're moving closer toward a more unified one-app experience domestically to pair high-quality general entertainment with content from our popular brands and franchises for our bundle subscribers.disney kid cartoonspatuletail/Shutterstock.comIt's a formula for success that we have already proven in international markets with our Star offering on Disney+. We see a future where consumers can access even more of the company's streaming content all in one place, resulting in higher user engagement, lower churn and greater opportunities for advertisers. We're also very optimistic about the long-term advertising potential of this business. Even amid a challenging ad market, this quarter, we began seeing early signs of improvement. And I'm pleased to announce that as of the end of Q3, we've signed up 3.3 million subscribers to our ad-supported Disney+ option. Since its inception, 40% of new Disney+ subscribers are choosing an ad-supported product. On our pricing strategy, this year alone, we've raised prices in nearly 50 countries around the world to better reflect the value of our product offerings, and the impact on churn and retention has outperformed our expectations.Later today, we will release details regarding upcoming streaming price increases. And I'm pleased to share that our ad-supported Disney+ subscription offerings will become available in Canada and in select markets across Europe, beginning November 1, while a new ad-free bundled subscription plan featuring Disney+ and Hulu will be available in the U.S. on September 6. Maintaining access to our content for as broad an audience as possible is top of mind for us, which is why pricing for our stand-alone ad-supported Disney+ and Hulu offerings will remain unchanged. I'd also like to note that we are actively exploring ways to address account sharing and the best options for paying subscribers to share their accounts with friends and family. Later this year, we will begin to update our subscriber agreements with additional terms on our sharing policies and we will roll out tactics to drive monetization sometime in 2024.Our DTC ambitions also extend to our sports business. Taking our ESPN flagship channels direct-to-consumer is not a matter of if but when. And the team is hard at work looking at all components of this decision, including pricing and timing. It's interesting to note that ratings continue to increase on ESPN's main linear channel even as cord cutting has accelerated. This rating strength creates tremendous advertising potential across the board. Our total domestic sports advertising revenue for linear and addressable is up 10% versus the prior year adjusted for comparability, which speaks to the fact that the sports business stands tall and remains a good value proposition. We believe in the power of sports and the unique ability to convene and engage audiences.Yesterday, it was announced that ESPN has entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with PENN Entertainment to further extend the ESPN brand into the growing sports betting marketplace. This licensing deal will offer a compelling new experience for sports fans that will enhance consumer engagement. We're excited to offer this to the many fans who have long been asking for it. Overall, we're considering potential strategic partnerships for ESPN, looking at distribution, technology, marketing and content opportunities where we retain control of ESPN. We've received notable interest from many different entities, and we look forward to sharing more details at a later date when we're further along in this process. Looking to our broader linear business.While linear remains highly profitable for Disney today, the trends being fueled by cord cutting are unmistakable. And as I've stated before, we are thinking expansively and considering a variety of strategic options. However, we're fortunate to have an array of extremely productive television studios that we will rely on to continue providing exceptional content for audiences well into the future. And speaking of the content we create, I'd like to say a few words about the ongoing strikes. Nothing is more important to this company than its relationships with the creative community, and that includes actors, writers, animators, directors and producers. I have deep respect and appreciation for all those who are vital to the extraordinary creative engine that drives this company and our industry.And it is my fervent hope that we quickly find solutions to the issues that have kept us apart these past few months, and I am personally committed to working to achieve this result. In closing, I returned to Disney in November and have agreed to stay on longer because there is more to accomplish before our transformation is complete and because I want to ensure a successful transition for my successor. In spite of a challenging environment in the near term, I'm overwhelmingly bullish about Disney's future for the reasons I shared at the beginning of this call. The work we've done over these past eight months are core foundation of creative excellence and iconic brands and franchises and because of the unrivaled talent we have at every level here at Disney.I have the highest confidence in our leadership team today, and I'm enormously proud of the ways each of them is helping steer the company through this moment of great change. And with that, I'll turn things over to Kevin.Kevin Lansberry: Thanks, Bob. It's good to be here and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal third quarter diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items were at $1.03, a decrease of $0.06 versus the prior year. In the coming months, we will be presenting recast financials in line with our new reorganized segments: Disney Entertainment, ESPN, and Parks, Experiences and Products. So today will be the last earnings call, where we will discuss our numbers under the existing structure. Now turning to this quarter's results. Starting off with direct-to-consumer. As Bob referenced earlier, we've improved direct-to-consumer operating results by $1 billion in just three quarters. For Q3, operating losses improved by approximately $150 million versus the prior quarter and by approximately $550 million versus the prior year.These results outperformed the guidance we gave on the last earnings call, largely due to lower-than-expected expenses, including from realizing SG&amp;A savings sooner than initially expected. Disney+ core subscribers grew by nearly 800,000 during the third quarter, in line with the commentary we made at our last earnings call, with international growth more than offsetting modest domestic net losses. As Bob mentioned, our progress will vary from quarter-to-quarter and we are more focused on overall economics versus pure sub growth. But currently, we do expect that in the fourth quarter, we will see core Disney+ net adds rebound with growth both domestically and internationally. Disney+ core ARPU increased sequentially by $0.11 driven by higher per subscriber advertising revenue domestically, as well as price increases in certain international markets.With over 40% of gross adds opting for the ad tier, the domestic Disney+ ad tier is continuing to improve our ARPU. And we look forward to the additional market launches announced today, which should serve as a stepping stone on our path to profitability. Disney+ Hotstar subscribers declined this quarter as we adjusted our product from one centered around the IPL to one more balanced with other sports and entertainment offerings. I would also note that this business with its significantly lower ARPU compared to core Disney+ is not a material component of our overall D2C financial results. We will therefore continue to focus our commentary on the core Disney+ product. Hulu and ESPN+ subscribers were roughly comparable to Q2. Hulu remained profitable in the third quarter with advertising revenue increasing versus the second quarter, benefiting sequentially from a higher sell-through rate.In Q4, we expect D2C ad revenue to continue to benefit from higher advertiser demand at Hulu as well as from the ramp-up of the Disney+ ad tier. As we work toward achieving D2C profitability by the end of fiscal 2024, we don't necessarily expect the progress to be linear each quarter as the impacts of the transformative work we are doing take time to realize. We expect to see more meaningful improvement in our D2C losses by middle of fiscal 2024. These expectations and plans remain subject to all of the risks and assumptions we previously identified and are noting here today, which will require close and ongoing assessment. But we remain encouraged by the early results we've already realized and are optimistic about our path ahead. Moving on to our content sales line of business.Operating results declined by a little over $200 million versus the prior year. Lower results in the third quarter versus the prior year were due to lower TV/SVOD and theatrical results. For Q4, we expect this business to generate operating losses up to $100 million worse than last year's fourth quarter. And at Linear Networks, operating income declined versus the prior year by $580 million driven by declines at both domestic and international channels. The decrease at domestic channels was driven by lower advertising and affiliate revenue and by higher programming and production costs driven by the NBA and the new Formula One agreement. While domestic linear advertising revenue declined year-over-year, ESPN ad revenue increased by 4%, demonstrating the relative strength of sports.Quarter-to-date, ESPN domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing down, reflecting in part the absence of the Big 10 this year. It's worth noting, however, that the absence of the Big 10 is expected to drive overall operating income favorability in Q4 versus the prior year. The fourth quarter will also hold one additional Monday night football game versus the prior year. Linear advertising continues to see impacts from market softness. While sports is healthy, entertainment continues to face headwinds. Note that we expect D2C advertising year-over-year growth to partially offset linear declines in the fourth quarter. And we wrap this year's upfront with overall volume roughly in line with the prior year. Growth in addressable revenue increased, representing over 40% of the total upfront volume, and sports pricing is up single digits across the board.Domestic Linear Networks affiliate revenue decreased by 2% from the prior year due to a 6-point decline from fewer subscribers, partially offset by 4 points of growth from contractual rate increases. International channels operating income decreased versus the prior year, driven by lower advertising revenue and to a lesser extent, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Our Parks, Experiences and Products portfolio of businesses continues to be an earnings and free cash flow growth driver for the company, with both revenue and operating income increasing by more than 10% versus the prior year. International parks continued its strong growth trend with year-over-year operating income increasing at all our international sites, but most significantly at Shanghai Disney, which saw record highs from a revenue, OI and margin perspective.At domestic Parks and Experiences, operating income was up 24% versus pre-pandemic results in fiscal '19, but declined 13% versus the prior year. In addition to the inflationary cost pressures we have discussed on prior calls and some of the near-term headwinds at Walt Disney World that Bob mentioned earlier, results reflect an approximately $100 million accelerated depreciation charge related to the closure of the Galactic Starcruiser. These drivers were partially offset by favorable performance at our Cruise Line and at the Disneyland Resort. While Walt Disney World results were down year-over-year, as Bob mentioned, operating income was nearly 30% higher versus 2019 when adjusting for the Starcruiser accelerated depreciation. Domestic parks attendance grew slightly year-over-year, reflecting comparisons against last year's strong trends coming out of the 50th anniversary at Walt Disney World.Per cap spending was comparable to the prior year with contributions from pricing, Genie+ and higher food and beverage spend offset by attendance composition changes and lower merchandise spend. Excluding the impact of the Starcruiser accelerated depreciation, domestic parks and Experiences operating margins in Q3 were roughly 3 percentage points below the prior year, and DPEP margins were slightly higher than the prior year. We continue to expect some moderation in demand at our domestic parks, as we compare against our highly successful 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World and the burn-off of pent-up demand persists, while elevated travel costs are impacting international visitation. We are also seeing continued cost pressures in the fourth quarter, predominantly from labor wage rate growth, coupled with $150 million of remaining accelerated depreciation for the Galactic Starcruiser.However, we still expect all-in Q4 operating margins at DPEP to exceed the prior year due to the ongoing strength of recovery at our international parks and Cruise Line. Putting this all together, excluding the impact of accelerated depreciation for the Starcruiser, we are still expecting full year total company revenue and segment operating income to grow at a high-single digit percentage rate versus the prior year. We currently expect fiscal 2023 content spend to come in at approximately $27 billion, which is lower than we previously guided due to lower spend on produced content, in part due to the writers' and actors' strikes. We now expect capital expenditures for the year to total $5 billion. This is lower than our prior guide, primarily due to spending timing shifts for various projects across the enterprise.In the midst of the transformative work we have been doing, we are prioritizing long-term free cash flow growth and have generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow in the third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with our single A credit ratings reflecting that strength. We have made significant progress deleveraging coming out of the pandemic, and we continue to approach capital allocation in a disciplined and balanced manner, prioritizing investments to generate future growth while also keeping an eye towards shareholder returns. And to that point, as we've mentioned before, we still expect to be in a position to recommend that the Board declared a modest dividend by the end of this calendar year with the intention to recommend increased shareholder returns over time as our earnings and free cash flow power grows.And with that, I will turn it back over to Alexia for Q&amp;A.Alexia Quadrani: Thanks, Kevin.

To skip our detailed analysis of the banking sector in 2023, you can go directly to see the 5 Cheap Bank Stocks To Buy Before They Take Off.Moody's Rating Actions On US BanksOn August 7, Moody's announced its rating actions on 27 US banks. These included the downgrades of 10 banks, while six other banks were placed on review for possible downgrades, and the outlooks of 11 other banks were changed from stable to negative. The credit rating agency considered several factors, including the banks' second-quarter earnings releases, interest rate risks, and more, in coming to these decisions. According to Moody's, the second quarter results for most banks in the US showed that they were suffering from growing profitability pressures, which the agency believes is likely to reduce their ability to generate internal capital. At the same time, the threat of a mild US recession, expected to hit in early 2024, also influenced the rating decisions.While several smaller and regional banks made the list of downgraded banks, some bigger names such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) managed to avoid landing the list. However, this is not true for every big bank in the country. Additionally, CNBC's Power Lunch on August 8 noted something of interest to investors looking at bank stocks today. CNBC reporter Leslie Picker said the following:""The major issues that the ratings agency flagged have been pretty well telegraphed since Moody's' prior round of actions for the regionals in the spring. Even as equity investors have been willing to look past some of the major industry headwinds, bond and options investors have not been quite as sanguine.""Why Now?The fact that Moody's decided to make this move now may signify that the agency is trying to tell banks that while there has been a ""quiet summer"" on the banking front so far, ""we may not be out of the woods quite yet."" Picker also noted that these negative rating actions were not anticipated by the market at all. On why the move came this month, Picker said the following:Story continues""Why now? We've seen the bulk of the earnings releases from the regionals at this point in time. So I think they were able to, you know, collate a bunch of the balance sheets, income statements, and draw some conclusions based on that.""The Moody's rating action is an additional setback for the banking and financial sector so far this year. Since the start of 2023, the banking sector has been struggling to retain its position in the market. The collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and some other banks have already dented the industry.  In light of this, the valuations of many major banks have dropped, which is a development that seems to have spooked many individuals in the market. At the same time, opportunistic investors are looking at the current situation of bank stocks as something they can profit from, considering the fact that well-established bank stocks that are usually much more expensive per share are now trading at lower valuations. This can thus be seen as the best time to pick up bank stocks at an attractive bargain. Considering the above, we have compiled a list of bank stocks to buy before they take off. They include some small bank stocks to buy alongside bigger names in the banking and financial sector.11 Cheap Bank Stocks To Buy Before They Take OffPhoto by Mikel Parera on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds and picked 11 most popular bank stocks among hedge funds with the lowest PE ratios.Cheap Bank Stocks To Buy Before They Take Off11.

Importantly, MTB has neither the same kind of client concentration risk nor duration risk that impacted Silicon Valley Bank. Particularly with respect to duration risk, MTB was an outlier in its conservatism with respect to buying shorter-term securities in a very low rate environment. MTB does have exposure to commercial real estate, including office real estate. While we do expect some elevated credit losses in this portion of the loan portfolio, we note MTB has historically been an effective manager of risk, and we remain confident that management has behaved with appropriate caution.”7.

Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. But Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAM) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 46% over five years, which is below the market return. Looking at the last year alone, the stock is up 8.7%.The past week has proven to be lucrative for Akamai Technologies investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance. See our latest analysis for Akamai Technologies While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Akamai Technologies managed to grow its earnings per share at 23% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 8% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Akamai Technologies' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Akamai Technologies shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 8.7% over one year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 8% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.

Both readings are expected to have declined further in July.Dollar strength hitting crudeThe strength of the U.S. dollar is also hurting the oil markets, with the greenback sitting at a five-week high after last week’s inflation readings provided more ammunition for the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer.A stronger dollar makes commodities priced in the greenback, like crude, more expensive, likely hitting demand among international buyers.Seven consecutive positive weeksAll that said, the oil markets have just registered seven weeks of gains on tightening supply after output cuts from primarily Saudi Arabia and Russia, under the umbrella of lower production targets by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+.Story continues“Sentiment remains largely positive with the oil balance set to continue to tighten, while stronger refinery margins are also providing some support,” analysts at ING said, in a note.That sentiment could be changing, though, as speculators have become reluctant to add to their positions, reducing their net long positions in Brent over the last reporting week.This suggests the market could now be in an overbought situation, with a correction possible in the coming days.(Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)Related ArticlesOil prices fall on China economic growth fears, stronger dollarWhite House finalizes guidance to boost use of U.S.-made goods in infrastructureCalifornia grid warns heat wave will stoke power demand]"
117,d5045101-8fd6-3fbd-bc3e-78ee8090c38b,CL,2023-08-14,Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 83% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/colgate-palmolive-company-nyse-cl-120026253.html,1691928026,STORY,['CL'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Colgate-Palmolive's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 49% ownershipUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyA look at the shareholders of Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 83% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Colgate-Palmolive. See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Colgate-Palmolive?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Colgate-Palmolive does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Colgate-Palmolive's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Colgate-Palmolive is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.7% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.2% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.8% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Colgate-PalmoliveWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Colgate-Palmolive Company insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$68m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 17% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Colgate-Palmolive , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. That's what has happened with the Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) share price. It's up 14% over three years, but that is below the market return. Unfortunately, the share price has fallen 4.7% over twelve months.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Juniper Networks To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Juniper Networks achieved compound earnings per share growth of 7.1% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 4% average annual increase in the share price. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Juniper Networks' TSR for the last 3 years was 24%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 4.0% in the last year, Juniper Networks shareholders lost 2.0% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 3% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Juniper Networks , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

If you want to skip our primer on wide moat investing, then head on over to 5 Best Wide Moat Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Among the countless ways in which companies on the stock market are segregated, one way is classifying them according to wide moat or narrow moat. In a nutshell, wide moat stocks are firms that are believed to have significant competitive advantages that are expected to make them stand out from peers for more than a decade. For firms that do not have these advantages, the term is 'narrow moat', and naturally, most media and investor attention often focuses on the former grouping with several exchange traded funds listing these companies as part of their investments.This economic moat as it's called comes courtesy of no one else but Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Buffett is known for investing in firms that he believes have a sustained competitive advantage over their peers and then holding their stock for years to let the price appreciation accrue and make the investment grow in value. Mr. Buffett has been talking about wide moats for decades now, and one latest example of his reliance on the term came during a shareholder letter in 2017 where he described the advantage that the Government Employees Insurance Company or GEICO has due to its wide moat. According to him:GEICO’s low costs create a moat – an enduring one – that competitors are unable to cross. As a result, the company gobbles up market share year after year, ending 2016 with about 12% of industry volume. That’s up from 2.5% in 1995, the year Berkshire acquired control of GEICO. Employment, meanwhile, grew from 8,575 to 36,085.The term was repeated again on the next page, with economic moat investing being a crucial part of Berkshire's investment philosophy as the Oracle of Omaha shared:Berkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a range of business models protected by wide moats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset for Berkshire shareholders that time will only make more valuableStory continuesSo, what is an economic moat and how does it affect a company's competitive advantages? Well, these advantages can come through a strong product that makes switching costs high (think for example how Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s ecosystem makes it difficult for long time users to switch), having a low cost production advantage that competitors cannot keep up with, or have superior technology that competitors are unable to match (for instance, SpaceX's rockets are the only ones of their kind that can autonomously land, which provides the company with a great cost advantage as it does not have to make a new rocket for every launch).Naturally, a firm's management plays a crucial role in developing economic moats to reap years of advantages. Management can create economic moats by investing in new technologies, acquiring firms that have competitive technologies, and trimming down the hedges by removing unprofitable businesses or products and focusing on ones that can compete well in the market.Using these principles, we can also try to guess which firms have a wide moat that could help them in their industry for decades to come. Well, one notable example is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) which is one the largest electronic commerce retailers in the world. Amazon's moat comes through the popularity of its platform, which is a household name and the firm maintains its advantage by employing thousands of drivers and operating numerous fulfillment centers to ensure that a competitor does not have a chance of beating it in scale. Using scale as a criterion for a wide economic moat, another giant in the retailing industry, and one which might not see any serious rivals in the future unless it's due to its own mistakes, is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Walmart is the largest retailer in the world, with more than two million employees, more than ten thousand stores, and a unique competitive advantage where it offers consumers the lowest prices on everyday products to make sure they return every time.Before we get to our list of the best wide moat stocks that are favored by hedge funds, it'd make sense to replug Warren Buffett's wisdom here from 1999 when he commented:Move on to failures of airlines. Here's a list of 129 airlines that in the past 20 years filed for bankruptcy. Continental was smart enough to make that list twice. As of 1992, in fact--though the picture would have improved since then--the money that had been made since the dawn of aviation by all of this country's airline companies was zero. Absolutely zero. Sizing all this up, I like to think that if I'd been at Kitty Hawk in 1903 when Orville Wright took off, I would have been farsighted enough, and public-spirited enough--I owed this to future capitalists--to shoot him down. I mean, Karl Marx couldn't have done as much damage to capitalists as Orville did. I won't dwell on other glamorous businesses that dramatically changed our lives but concurrently failed to deliver rewards to U.S. investors: the manufacture of radios and televisions, for example.But I will draw a lesson from these businesses: The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors.So what are the wide moat stocks that hedge funds are buying? Some top picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).13 Best Wide Moat Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by David Martin on UnsplashOur Methodology To make our list of the best wide moat stocks that hedge funds are buying, we narrowed down the top 30 holdings of the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF and then selected the top 13 companies with the greatest number of hedge fund investors as of Q1 2023 end.Best Wide Moat Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds13.

That is up from 8% a year earlier. A negative IMR forces insurers to tap pots of money they would have otherwise spent on their business or returned to shareholders.The change, which would expire at the end of 2025 unless revisited, will allow insurers to realize some of these losses over time, rather than straight away, according to a draft of the proposal released by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).The Reuters review, which included a search of the public filings of all insurers listed in the stock market as well as those rated by credit ratings agencies, shows the changes will be particularly advantageous for firms invested in long-term bonds. This is because bonds that were issued before the Federal Reserve raised interest rates more than 5 percentage points over the last year carry much lower rates, and insurers incurred losses when they sell them.Among those insurers are Prudential Financial, OneAmerica Financial Partners, Principal Financial and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, according to Fitch. In the case of Prudential, the reprieve would be worth more than $1.3 billion, according to the company's disclosures. That compares to $1.8 billion in net fixed income-related losses Prudential recorded in 2022.Story continuesThe NAIC's move diverges with how banking regulators have approached the same issue. They do not give banks the option of deferring interest rate-related losses, fearing excesses that led to the 2008 financial crisis. Such losses were behind the collapse of major regional banks this year, including Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank.Some consumer advocates have criticized the NAIC for going ahead with the proposal. Edward Stone, a lawyer who has represented policyholders in cases where troubled insurance companies were liquidated, said the rule change would encourage more insurers to risk investment losses in order to juice returns.""Insurance companies, for decades, have been trying to kick the can down the road. This is just another attempt by them to say we should get some sort of favorable accounting treatment,"" Stone said.An NAIC spokesperson said the change is in the interest of insurance policyholders, because they would make it easier for insurers to sell loss-making bonds to re-invest in higher-yielding ones, boosting their financial health.A representative for the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI), a lobby group that pushed for the change, said its intention is to harmonize the treatment of interest rate-related losses and gains. Under existing rules, insurers with a positive IMR realize the benefit over time, rather than immediately.Insurers in the United States are regulated by individual states rather than the federal government, but the NAIC has said that all states will automatically adopt the change it backs. While the change sunsets in 2025, the NAIC is also considering a long-term tweak to the rules, insurers including Equitable Holdings and MetLife have said in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).DEFERRING LOSSESFollowing the rule change, insurers will be allowed to amortize interest rate-related losses over time equivalent to 10% of their statutory surplus. The statutory surplus is the difference between insurers' assets and liabilities, money that can be used to pay policyholders in unforeseen circumstances.The new regime has some safeguards. A key metric of an insurer's financial health, its risk-based capital ratio, would have to be at least 300% after adjustments to be allowed to defer interest rate-related losses.Prudential would have been able to reverse about $1.3 billion of $1.8 billion in bond losses last year had the new rules been in place, Chief Financial Officer Ken Tanji told analysts on the company's second-quarter earnings call.The change will also increase Prudential's risk-based capital ratio to 409% from 383%, according to an SEC filing. Staying close to the 400% threshold is a target many insurers seek to achieve a better credit rating.A Prudential spokesperson declined to comment beyond Tanji's remarks.A spokesperson for MassMutual, which along with Prudential, OneAmerica, and Principal Financial ranks among the insurers rated by Fitch that have the largest negative IMR balances, declined to comment on gauges of the company's financial strength, such as its risk-based capital ratio. The spokesperson would only say that MassMutual had a negative IMR balance of $611 million as of the first quarter of 2023.OneAmerica declined to comment, while Principal Financial did not respond to requests for comment.Some insurers that do not carry large negative IMR balances also say they would benefit from having room to take more risk when hedging interest rates.

122,661f43f3-7b02-3889-a350-7fdd71fdde3d,DVN,2023-08-14,3 Energy Stocks to Unplug on Dim Prospects,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-energy-stocks-unplug-dim-195713480.html,1691438233,STORY,"['GS', 'SU', 'DVN', 'XOM']","[A lot of people on Wall Street are bullish on energy right now, with investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently forecasting that the price of Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, will be at $86 a barrel by year’s end. But not so fast. In mid-July, the International Energy Agency (IEA) lowered its global oil demand forecast for the first time this year, citing a worsening economic outlook. The world’s leading energy watchdog said oil demand is likely to climb by 2.2 million barrels per day in 2023 and reach an average of 102.1 million barrels per day. That projection is a downward revision of 220,000 barrels of crude oil a day. The IEA had previously predicted an increase of 2.4 million barrels of oil each day for the remainder of the year.The new outlook comes as energy companies report second-quarter financial results that are down substantially from a year ago when crude oil prices peaked at $122 a barrel. Looking at the big picture, now would be a good time to get out of troubled oil stocks. Here are three energy stocks to unplug on dim prospects.Suncor Energy (SU)Suncor Energy logo displayed on a modern smartphoneSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comCanadian oil and natural gas producer Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU) has so many problems that they read like a laundry list. The latest issue to hurt the troubled energy producer was a July cyberattack that temporarily crippled its network of more than 1,500 Petro-Canada retail gas stations and led to the shutdown of its consumer rewards program after it was determined that hackers stole members’ contact information.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsA few weeks before the cyberattack, Suncor announced plans to cut 1,500 jobs by the end of this year as it seeks to reduce costs and bolster its finances. The Calgary-based oil producer said the workforce reduction will be spread across the entire organization. That is after the company reported that its first-quarter net income declined 34% from a year earlier to $1.81 billion.Story continuesIf all this weren’t enough, Suncor is under persistent pressure from activist shareholder Elliott Investment Management to improve its financial performance and boost its stock price, both of which have trailed other energy companies. SU stock has declined 25% over the last five years, making it an energy stock to sell.Exxon Mobil (XOM)XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some TimeSource: ShutterstockExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is a perfect example of an energy company whose earnings have been cut in half this year — literally. Exxon Mobil just reported a 56% decline in its Q2 profit due to a drop in crude oil prices. The company said its Q2 net income amounted to $7.88 billion, or $1.94 a share, compared to a record $17.85 billion profit recorded a year earlier. Revenue was also lower in the quarter, falling 27% to $80.80 billion year-over-year.The company did its best to put a positive spin on its latest print, stressing that it achieved structural cost savings of $8.3 billion from 2019 levels during Q2. Exxon Mobil also highlighted that it distributed $8 billion in cash to shareholders in Q2, including $3.7 billion in dividend payments. But how long will that last if the company’s financial results continue to deteriorate? XOM stock is flat on the year, having risen only 0.85% since January.Devon Energy (DVN)An image of a hand holding a smartphone displaying the Devon Energy Corporation logo in front of a computer screenSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is learning the hard way not to cut its dividend. The company’s share price has declined 13% this year, and the drop is due almost entirely to the fact that Devon Energy has reduced its dividend payout to shareholders multiple times in recent months. As part of its Q2 financial release, the company announced that it is lowering its dividend payout for the fourth time, citing dwindling cash flow as the reason.Going forward, Devon Energy will pay a quarterly dividend payment of 49 cents a share, down 32% from 72 cents previously. The multiple cuts to the dividend have understandably angered shareholders, many of whom have hit the sell button on DVN stock. The latest cut to the dividend comes as Devon Energy reported $690 million in Q2 net earnings, the lowest level in two years. Free cash flow fell 50% to $326 million year-over-year in Q2.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Including this payment, the dividend yield on the stock will be 1.0%, which is a modest boost for shareholders' returns. Check out our latest analysis for P10 P10's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. The last dividend was quite easily covered by P10's earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio will be 20%, which makes us pretty comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendP10 Doesn't Have A Long Payment HistoryWithout a track record of dividend payments, we can't make a judgement on how stable it has been. This doesn't mean that the company can't pay a good dividend, but just that we want to wait until it can prove itself.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. P10 has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 25% per annum. The company's earnings per share has grown rapidly in recent years, and it has a good balance between reinvesting and paying dividends to shareholders, so we think that P10 could prove to be a strong dividend payer.We Really Like P10's DividendIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for P10 that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Is P10 not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The US stock markets are undergoing a positive euphoria as several analysts have started to believe the much-anticipated recession everyone was worried about for about a year now might not happen after all. This is because the Federal Reserve’s fight against inflation is slowly but surely bearing some fruit. Inflation is declining and major research institutions which were vehemently predicting recession are having second thoughts. These positive developments are having a direct impact on the consumer discretionary sector, which suffered when dark clouds were hovering over the US economy and financial markets. When things go south, consumers cut back on discretionary spending and only spend on essential items, making consumer discretionary stocks worst performers when common households are not doing good. But as recession clouds abate and consumer confidence begins to rebound, consumer discretionary stocks are back in action.Deloitte published its State of the US Consumer report in July which shares some interesting insights that are directly linked to consumer spending and show what’s going on in US households when it comes to budget planning and spending. The report said that the percentage of respondents in the US who were concerned about their savings and who were delaying large purchases due to inflation fell in June, thanks to a clear fall in inflation. The report also said that “consumer spending intentions” rebounded in June after falling consistently for about a year. The Deloitte report retail sales jumped in May for the second straight month and they are already up about 31.6% from the pre-COVID levels.Last month, a Wall Street Journal report highlighted an important trend that adds another positive development in the latest cycle of positive news. The report said that for several months just a handful of companies were responsible for all the gains of the S&amp;P 500 index. But that trend is changing and major sectors are now adding to the broader market’s growth. Several stocks from the consumer discretionary sector were also noted to have added to the total market gains.Story continuesThe WSJ report said that over 140 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index have hit fresh 52-week highs since the end of May. Some of the notable companies from the consumer sector adding to these gains include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD).Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundswithGod/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor this article we first listed all the holdings of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund.

(NASDAQ:ROST)’s management, in a question on its plans to recapturing margins of pre-COVID times, said:""Our long-term operating margin improvements are to be highly dependent on us delivering strong sales over a sustained period of time. And then the question on how long do inflationary pressures persist, but — over the longer term, we believe we can achieve gradual improvement in profitability. I think if you get into like, are there any structural questions related to that? We’re seeing tangible benefit in freight cost, but we’re still — these costs still are not at pre-pandemic levels. And then we’re seeing some wage pressures in the stores. When you talk about — we’ve guided to CapEx of $810 million. So a big component of that in addition to distribution center capacity, in addition to investing in the 100 new stores, a big chunk of that is technology investments that will drive further efficiencies within the stores and in our distribution centers.So more automation in our distribution centers and some store initiatives that we’ve touched on in the past.Madison Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The bottom five contributors for the quarter were Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST), W.R. Berkley, Gartner, Glacier Bancorp, and Carlisle. Sales trends at Ross Stores remain so-so, with flattish sales compared to a year ago. The low-to-moderate income consumer has started to struggle as stimulus payments and government support initiatives from the COVID period are wearing off, and inflation is eating away at purchasing power.”14. MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Hospitality and entertainment company MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) ranks 14th in our list of the best consumer discretionary stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

MGM is seeing continued strength at its Vegas properties and now has the tailwind of China’s domestic re-opening for its Macau properties.

The company offers a wide range of travel shopping and reservation services, as well as provides real-time access to schedule, pricing and availability information for airlines, hotels and car rental companies.

Additionally Expedia has exposure to airline ticket sales and automobile rentals.

As it relates to our remaining guidance, we are pleased to reaffirm full year guidance on all other measures. As a reminder, that includes revenue growth of 10% to 12%, global comp growth near the high end of 7% to 9% and solid margin expansion. Store growth, capital spend and tax rate guidance also remain unchanged from what we shared previously. As a reminder, we expect an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points on fiscal year 2023 revenue and earnings, respectively.With that, let me provide further detail around our Q4. First, in regard to International. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we expect our International segment Q4 margin to expand year-over-year but to be meaningfully lower than Q3 due to seasonality along with accelerated digital and store renovation investments. Second, in regard to China, as I noted earlier, we expect China’s average weekly sales to continue to sustain the growth quarter-over-quarter, resulting in average weekly sales growth of low to mid-single digits in Q4, with similar sized comp growth as the market is lapping government stimulus for customers and favorable discounting from prior year coupled with the timing of difference of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which all contributed to prior year transaction growth.”The London Company Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) – Sentiment on SBUX turned more negative in this uncertain macro environment with the impending return of student loan payments in the U.S. SBUX reported very strong results for the Jan-March quarter, but exercised caution by not raising guidance. SBUX is beginning to realize tailwinds from the re-opening of the Chinese economy, adding a buffer to growth and margins for the remainder of the year.”6.

If you want to skip our discussion on the banking industry, head directly to Goldman Sachs Bank Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks. Fitch Ratings forecasts that the strength of banking assets in several markets will decline compared to their robust historical performance. Business activities are likely to remain slow, given the inflation and interest rate pressures. However, the potentially positive impact of higher interest rates on net interest margins could partially counterbalance these factors. In some markets, particularly in the United States, stricter financial policies contribute to challenges related to deposit balances, shifts in deposit accounts, and increased deposit betas. Consequently, net interest margins have already reached their highest point or will do so soon, which hinders potential gains. Fitch Ratings provided a ‘deteriorating’ sector outlook to banking industries at the beginning of this year, particularly the United States, Canada, and some regions in Western Europe. Australian banks were assigned a ‘deteriorating’ outlook as well, while Hong Kong banks were allocated an ‘improving’ rating.Following the March 2023 banking crisis, the International Monetary Fund trimmed its estimates for the worldwide economy, citing “the recent increase in financial market volatility.” The IMF also revised its forecasts for economic expansion. It first expected a 3.4% growth in 2022, and now the growth estimate stands at 2.8% in 2023. IMF’s latest report said: “Uncertainty is high, and the balance of risks has shifted firmly to the downside so long as the financial sector remains unsettled.”Don't Miss: Goldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 2023Rising interest rates will elevate losses on securities held by banks and encourage savers to withdraw funds from their accounts, putting pressure on the primary way banks generate profits. Losses related to commercial real estate and other loans have only just started to become prominent for banks, further diminishing their financial performance. Following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, regulatory focus will shift towards medium-sized banks due to potential supervisory oversights. According to CNBC, many of America’s 4,672 banks will find themselves merging with stronger counterparts in the coming years, propelled either by market dynamics or regulatory policies. This forecast is based on insights from a dozen executives, advisors, and investment bankers surveyed by CNBC. A recent example is JPMorgan's acquisition of First Republic for $10.6 billion. Story continuesAlso Read: 15 Worst Performing Bank Stocks in 2023On August 8, Moody's downgraded the credit ratings of numerous small and medium-sized U.S. banks, while also placing several prominent banks under scrutiny for potential negative revisions. Major financial entities such as Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp, State Street, Truist Financial, Cullen/Frost Bankers, and Northern Trust are currently undergoing assessment for a potential downgrade. Moody’s analysts Jill Cetina and Ana Arsov commented in a research note:“U.S. banks continue to contend with interest rate and asset-liability management (ALM) risks with implications for liquidity and capital, as the wind-down of unconventional monetary policy drains systemwide deposits and higher interest rates depress the value of fixed-rate assets. Meanwhile, many banks’ Q2 results showed growing profitability pressures that will reduce their ability to generate internal capital. This comes as a mild U.S. recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline from solid but unsustainable levels, with particular risks in some banks’ commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios.”Amid the gloomy outlook for the banking industry, we take a look at Goldman Sachs’ Q1 2023 portfolio for the firm’s top bank stock picks. These include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). Our Methodology We used Goldman Sachs’ Q1 2023 portfolio and selected the 10 biggest positions in banks during the quarter for this list. We have mentioned Goldman Sachs’ stake value and the hedge fund sentiment towards each stock as of the first quarter of 2023. The list is ranked in the ascending order of the firm’s stake value in each holding. Goldman Sachs Bank Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksPhoto by Mikel Parera on UnsplashGoldman Sachs Bank Stocks: Top Stock Picks10.

D E Shaw is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 12.2 million shares worth $642.7 million. In addition to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is one of the top Goldman Sachs bank stocks. Broyhill Asset Management made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“After the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the market turned a critical eye to the financial sector. Institutional investors sharpened their forensic accounting pencils and hypothesized, “What would happen to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) should its depositors take their money and run?” While this is a helpful exercise, we believe the probability of a run on Schwab Bank is low. Schwab is not SVB. Its deposit base is sticky and fragmented; Silicon Valley’s was not. Less than 10% of SVB’s deposit base was under the FDIC insurance limit, and its core customers were rate-sensitive startups and venture capitalists with fickle cash needs. In contrast, ~80% of Schwab’s deposit base is under the FDIC’s limit and spread across millions of brokerage accounts that keep cash on hand for investment. Rather than spending our time replicating doomsday scenarios, we began by estimating the risk to Schwab’s earnings power should it need to raise the rate paid on deposits in line with competitors. Even under this scenario, we believe our downside is limited. Longer term, we believe Schwab has multiple levers it can pull to monetize the ~ $7 trillion in assets trusted in its custody.”9.

134,98efe730-4fce-345e-b9c1-cfd17b1e6f06,GE,2023-08-14,Investors in General Electric (NYSE:GE) have seen impressive returns of 179% over the past three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-general-electric-nyse-ge-130024535.html,1691931624,STORY,['GE'],"[The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. For example, the General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) share price has soared 115% in the last three years. That sort of return is as solid as granite. It's also good to see the share price up 12% over the last quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 8.9% in 90 days).With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, General Electric moved from a loss to profitability. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that General Electric has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for General Electric the TSR over the last 3 years was 179%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that General Electric shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 84% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 10% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand General Electric better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for General Electric that you should be aware of before investing here.But note: General Electric may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

135,e4324bc9-efca-31e6-83c9-d69a884a1e01,VLO,2023-08-14,7 Stocks to Buy Now to Beat the Inflation Blues,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-now-beat-222454212.html,1691447094,STORY,"['NEM', 'ACI', 'VLO', 'GOOGL', 'PRTS', 'SO', 'AWK']","[In June, annual inflation (from the most recent data) slipped to 3%, which on paper clashes with the concept of stocks to beat inflation. After all, NPR pointed out that the aforementioned statistic represented the lowest point since March 2021. That’s a sign that the Federal Reserve’s hawkish interest rate hiking campaign is making an impact.However, the main challenge with this thesis is the “core inflation” indicator, which strips out volatile food and energy prices. Unfortunately, this metric clocked in at 4.8% in June, well above the Fed’s target of 2%. At the time, analysts speculated that the central bank would raise rates again to combat price acceleration. It did just that, which seems to clash again with inflation-proof stocks.Nevertheless, the labor market remains robust, which is why investors should still buy stocks for inflation protection. True, the latest tally in July slipped against expectations. However, the unemployment rate also sank back to 3.5%, indicating labor sector resilience.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPut another way, more dollars continue to chase after fewer goods. So, you should beat inflation with stocks that might cynically rise in this heightened environment.Newmont (NEM)A pile of shining gold bars. Gold stocksSource: ShutterstockFrankly, the narrative for metals and mining giant Newmont (NYSE:NEM) as one of the stocks to beat inflation speaks for itself. Should inflation worsen, the commodities sector will almost surely benefit. Not only that, Newmont’s gold business should blossom. Historically, gold carries a reputation for being a safe-haven asset against inflationary pressures.Further, I appreciate that you can accrue some decent passive income with NEM. Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 3.91%. That’s noticeably above the materials sector’s average yield of 2.82%. Also, while the payout ratio isn’t the lowest, at 58.95%, investors shouldn’t fret too much about yield sustainability.Story continuesFinancially, Newmont could use some improvements as the company tackled the headwinds associated with the Covid-19 crisis and later the Fed’s hawkish monetary policy. Still, if the central bank can’t tackle elevated prices, NEM makes a compelling case for inflation-proof stocks.Southern Company (SO)the southern company logo displayed several times on a screenSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comA gas and electric utility holding firm, Southern Company (NYSE:SO) offers, in my opinion, a no-brainer for stocks to beat inflation. Basically, the case for SO comes down to its underlying natural monopoly. According to Southern’s public profile, it serves nine million customers. You’re not just going to come in and compete with this enterprise.Another fundamental catalyst for SO – and one you should pay attention to if you want to buy stocks for inflation protection – is the necessity of the business. Unlike a discretionary purchase like an overpriced latte at a fancy coffee shop, you must pay your bills. Otherwise, you suffer a ripple effect that could easily ruin your life.Lastly, investors seeking to beat inflation with stocks should earmark SO. Not only does it provide an indelible business, but it also offers robust passive income. Currently, Southern carries a forward yield of 4.13%, above the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%.American Water Works (AWK)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comAnother candidate for no-brainer ideas for stocks to beat inflation, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is a public utility that provides water and wastewater services in the U.S. Per its corporate profile, the company serves approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states. Overall, the underlying user base comes out to about 14 million through 3.4 million customer connections.Again, if you want to buy stocks for inflation protection, you’ve got to think cynically. You’re looking for businesses that no matter what people must engage. Obviously, holistic water-related services represent one of the most important. If you don’t believe me, don’t pay your water bills. Let’s see how quickly that steamrolls into one giant pile.Primarily, American Water is indelible so it doesn’t need that much coaxing as it relates to inflation-proof stocks. But as a bonus, the company also carries a forward yield of 1.99%. While it’s lower than the utility sector’s average yield, American Water Works also commands 14 years of consecutive annual dividend increases.Valero Energy (VLO)3D rendered two black oil barrels on digital financial chart screen with yellow numbers and rising, green, falling, red arrows on black background. Oil stocksSource: stockwars / Shutterstock.comA downstream energy specialist, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) focuses mostly on manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels. While the political and ideological narrative has shifted toward the electrification of mobility, the harsh reality is that electric vehicles are still too expensive for average households. Plus, inflation would likely force consumers to make do with what they have, not go out and buy replacement vehicles.With people stuck with their combustion-powered vehicles, Valero should benefit cynically. Therefore, I anticipate VLO to rise as one of the stocks to beat inflation. Yes, shares have only gained about 6% since the Jan. opener. However, over the trailing one-year period, they’re up nearly 21%. Another benefit to targeting Valero as one of the inflation-proof stocks centers on its passive income. Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 3.22%. It’s a bit lower than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. However, you must also factor in the low payout ratio of 30.9%.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comOff the top, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) might seem like a strange idea if you want to buy stocks for inflation protection. However, the owner of the massive Google ecosystem should thrive under a framework of rising or elevated prices. During difficulties, people look for different avenues to cope. And what better way to find information than through Google? After all, it dominates the global search engine market.Another fundamental factor that should lift GOOG as one of the stocks to beat inflation is its YouTube video content platform. With so much (free) information available there, you can practically pick up a doctorate degree or two in whatever subject you’re studying. Here, people searching for lifehacks to save money to tips on landing a dream job should translate to greater engagement. And that engagement leads to more advertising dollars.Plus, the company continues to benefit from solid revenue and EBITDA growth. As well, it’s consistently profitable with a trailing-year net margin of 21%. If you want to beat inflation with stocks, take a look at GOOG.Albertsons (ACI)Albertsons (ACI) store with logoSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWading into the riskier ideas for stocks to beat inflation, grocery giant Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) cuts a somewhat disappointing figure. Since the start of the year, ACI gained just a hair over 5%. During the trailing one-year period, shares slipped almost 20%. Nevertheless, the main fundamental catalyst of the trade-down effect should help invigorate sentiment.As a McKinsey &amp; Company report indicated earlier this year, consumers hurt by inflation are trading down. Basically, they’re forgoing expensive brands or stores for their lower-cost alternative. Eventually, I forecast you’ll see wholesale trade downs. In particular, people won’t be so eager to eat out at fancy restaurants. Instead, they’ll cook for themselves and their families.Also, while Albertsons presents significant risks, it also entices investors who want to buy stocks for inflation protection. Notably, the market prices ACI at a forward multiple of 7.76. As a discount to projected earnings, Albertsons ranks better than 96.83% of the defensive retail competition.CarParts.com (PRTS)A stack of auto partsSource: ShutterstockTo be upfront, online aftermarket auto parts provider CarParts.com (NASDAQ:PRTS) ranks among the riskiest ideas for stocks to beat inflation. It’s incredibly relevant because of the conditions impacting the consumer economy. However, since the Jan. opener, PRTS lost more than 28% of its equity value. During the trailing one-year period, PRTS gave up over 46%.At the same time, the fundamentals are aligning beautifully (albeit cynically) for CarParts.com. As data from S&amp;P Global Mobility showed, this year, the average age of passenger vehicles on U.S. roadways hit 12.5 years, a record. This dynamic confirms that people are hurting with higher prices. It’s not just “paper” pain. What’s more, the framework has a consequential effect on the auto parts industry. In other words, consumers are going to drive their incumbent vehicles until the wheels fall off. This factor alone should be a huge catalyst for PRTS. That’s why I’m including it on this list of inflation-proof stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

136,04de5388-c4ce-3d2e-ab0c-c8f045a42896,UNH,2023-08-14,UnitedHealth Group Incorporated's (NYSE:UNH) Stock Has Fared Decently: Is the Market Following Strong Financials?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-group-incorporateds-nyse-unh-110022870.html,1692010822,STORY,['UNH'],"[UnitedHealth Group's (NYSE:UNH) stock is up by 5.9% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study UnitedHealth Group's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for UnitedHealth Group is:24% = US$22b ÷ US$92b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.24 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of UnitedHealth Group's Earnings Growth And 24% ROETo begin with, UnitedHealth Group has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 11% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This probably laid the groundwork for UnitedHealth Group's moderate 11% net income growth seen over the past five years.Next, on comparing UnitedHealth Group's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 11% over the last few years.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for UNH? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is UnitedHealth Group Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?UnitedHealth Group has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 30% (or a retention ratio of 70%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Besides, UnitedHealth Group has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 25% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that UnitedHealth Group's future ROE will rise to 29% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with UnitedHealth Group's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

(DE).The July retail sales report is due out Tuesday morning while the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting will be released Wednesday afternoon. Yahoo Finance will also feature a week-long special, Retail Evolution: The New Era, during our livestreaming programming beginning Monday morning.Last week, markets were mixed as August's lackluster trading continued during the month's first full week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) continued trudging higher, rising 0.6% on the week while the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both closed the week in the red. The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 enter the third week of August at their lowest levels in a month.Last week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed headline inflation's rapid cooldown took a pause in July, rising 3.2% last month after increasing 3% in June.But economists came away from the report focused on monthly price increases remaining low for the second straight month.On a monthly basis, core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy categories, increased 0.2% in July, the same increase as in June. That marked the first time since February 2021 that core CPI rose just 0.2% in consecutive months.""This month's soft core print confirms the disinflationary process,"" Morgan Stanley chief US economist Ellen Zentner wrote after the report on Thursday. ""After 6 months of 0.4% [month-over-month] prints, a second 0.16% [month-over-month increase] comes as a sign of continued deceleration.""Most Wall Street economists now see the Fed holding interest rates steady at its next meeting in September.Story continues""The Fed is attempting to fine tune the policy path as it gets close to the end of the hiking cycle and does not want to short-circuit the business cycle if inflation is already moving towards target,"" Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen wrote on Friday.The firm now expects the Fed will raise rates in November as opposed to next month, writing, ""An additional six weeks would give the Fed more time to assess the trajectory of the economy.""As of Friday afternoon, markets were pricing in a roughly 89% chance that the Fed holds steady at its September meeting, up from a 72% chance on July 11, per data from CME Group.The minutes from the Fed's July meeting, which will offer additional insight into how Fed officials see the future path of policy, are set for release at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday.Retail in focusFrom ""Barbie"" and Taylor Swift to economists pushing back or eliminating recession calls, a resilient consumer has been the story of the economy during the summer of 2023.Corporate results from major banks and some airlines have told a similar story too. There has been a slowdown, but in large part the consumer continues to spend more than most investors and economists had expected, leading to surprising growth in the American economy. This week will provide more key details on how Americans are spending and, more importantly, if companies think a second-half consumer slowdown is materializing.The July retail sales report is expected at 8:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday with economists anticipating sales increased 0.4% over the prior month. Retail sales increased 0.2% in June.""We expect a robust July sales report,"" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave wrote on Thursday, citing the company's credit and debit card data which showed spending was strong during the July 4 holiday. ""We forecast above-consensus increases of 0.7% and 0.6% in the Census Bureau's July figures for retail sales ex-autos and the core control group, respectively.""On the corporate side, investors will be looking to see if some of the cracks that appeared in the retail space three months ago have widened.In May, Home Depot warned consumers were completing smaller projects at home and buying fewer big-ticket items. Meanwhile, Target said its discretionary business, which includes items like technology and clothes, had begun to lag.Customers shop at a Walmart store on May 18, 2023, in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)At both Target and Walmart, investors will be focused on same-store sales, any signs of a consumer trade-down, how cooling inflation could be impacting margins, and the state of retail crime.At Target, any lasting impacts after customer backlash regarding the company's Pride Collection released in May will also be in focus. Walmart investors will be on the lookout for how grocery and pharmacy differentiate Walmart from other retailers.""The question is what happens in the back half of the year and into next year as some of the of the excess savings are worked down and the labor market becomes a little less certain,"" UBS analyst Michael Lasser told Yahoo Finance Live last week.

Rather than a sharp downward correction, many stocks have corrected in time and built out some sideways action.For investors that like trading momentum breakouts, these sideways consolidations provide perfect setups to measure trades from.With inflation continuing to ease, the US economy growing at an accelerating pace, and the Federal Reserve laying out a path for lower interest rates, many bullish factors are aligning for what could be an extended bull market.Amazon, Sherwin Williams and Caterpillar are three premier US stocks that are forming A+ trade setups. Each of these stocks have considerably outperformed the broad market over the last 10 years, enjoy top Zacks Ranks, have momentum at their back, and are building convincing technical chart patterns.Amazon.com Amazon has made a stunning comeback from the bear market of 2022, rallying 65% YTD. And with some very powerful upward revisions to its earnings estimates, AMZN has jumped onto the Zacks #1 Rank.During the last quarterly earnings report Amazon surprised to the upside by 43%, showing just how effective its restructuring has been this last year. Current quarter earnings estimates have been upgraded by 43.6% and are projected to climb 180% YoY to $0.56 per share. FY23 earnings estimates have been revised higher by 38.5% and forecast to grow 204% YoY to $2.16 per share.Additionally, sales are projected to grow over 10% across time frames and EPS are expected to increase by 34% annually over the next 3-5 years.Reflecting the drastically improving business performance, AMZN stock is setting up a compelling technical chart pattern. Over the last week price action in the stock has formed a tidy bull flag.Story continuesIf Amazon can trade above the $139.50 level, it should initiate a breakout and draw in a rush of buyers sending the stock higher. However, if it loses the $136 level investors should remain cautious as the signal is invalid, and the stock may want to fill the earnings gap below.Sherwin Williams Currently sitting in the top 2% of the Zacks Industry Rank, Sherwin Williams stock looks primed for another move higher in the coming weeks. Bolstered by a strong economy, and upward trending earnings revisions, I think investors must keep an eye on this classic American stock.Sherwin Williams stock has built out a prototypical cup and handle pattern, with a tight bull flag forming over the last couple of weeks.If SHW price can break out above the $274.50 level, it should begin its next leg higher. Alternatively, if the stock can't hold the $270 level of support, investors should wait for another opportunity as the setup is invalid.Sherwin Williams has begun to see steady earnings estimate upgrades, as analysts have unanimously agreed on upward revisions. Because of this earnings revision trend, SHW has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating.Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 8.7% to $2.75 per share, while FY23 estimates have been revised higher by nearly 10% to $9.56 per share.Caterpillar Caterpillar stock gapped up to new all-time highs last week, following a huge earnings beat. Since the report the stock has held the gap and formed a neat bull flag consolidation to trade from.If CAT stock can breakout above the $288.50 level, a rush of buying should propel the stock to another new all-time high. But, if the price loses the support of the $278 level, it could fill that earnings gap, so investors should be caution below there.The incredibly strong construction market has been a major boon for Caterpillars stock, sending sales and earnings estimates much higher and giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating.Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 10% and are forecast to grow 14% YoY to $4.50 per share. FY23 earnings estimates have been revised higher by 8.4% and are expected to climb 39% YoY to $19.25.Additionally, current quarter sales are projected to grow 8% YoY to $16.2 billion and FY23 sales are set to increase 11.6% YoY to $66.3 billion.Bottom LineHere I have shared some very clean trade setups, however investors should always keep risk management top of mind. Even the best setups can fail, so we should always be aware of our max risk stop-loss and respect the trading plan.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

141,e4324bc9-efca-31e6-83c9-d69a884a1e01,AWK,2023-08-14,7 Stocks to Buy Now to Beat the Inflation Blues,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-now-beat-222454212.html,1691447094,STORY,"['NEM', 'ACI', 'VLO', 'GOOGL', 'PRTS', 'SO', 'AWK']","[In June, annual inflation (from the most recent data) slipped to 3%, which on paper clashes with the concept of stocks to beat inflation. After all, NPR pointed out that the aforementioned statistic represented the lowest point since March 2021. That’s a sign that the Federal Reserve’s hawkish interest rate hiking campaign is making an impact.However, the main challenge with this thesis is the “core inflation” indicator, which strips out volatile food and energy prices. Unfortunately, this metric clocked in at 4.8% in June, well above the Fed’s target of 2%. At the time, analysts speculated that the central bank would raise rates again to combat price acceleration. It did just that, which seems to clash again with inflation-proof stocks.Nevertheless, the labor market remains robust, which is why investors should still buy stocks for inflation protection. True, the latest tally in July slipped against expectations. However, the unemployment rate also sank back to 3.5%, indicating labor sector resilience.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPut another way, more dollars continue to chase after fewer goods. So, you should beat inflation with stocks that might cynically rise in this heightened environment.Newmont (NEM)A pile of shining gold bars. Gold stocksSource: ShutterstockFrankly, the narrative for metals and mining giant Newmont (NYSE:NEM) as one of the stocks to beat inflation speaks for itself. Should inflation worsen, the commodities sector will almost surely benefit. Not only that, Newmont’s gold business should blossom. Historically, gold carries a reputation for being a safe-haven asset against inflationary pressures.Further, I appreciate that you can accrue some decent passive income with NEM. Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 3.91%. That’s noticeably above the materials sector’s average yield of 2.82%. Also, while the payout ratio isn’t the lowest, at 58.95%, investors shouldn’t fret too much about yield sustainability.Story continuesFinancially, Newmont could use some improvements as the company tackled the headwinds associated with the Covid-19 crisis and later the Fed’s hawkish monetary policy. Still, if the central bank can’t tackle elevated prices, NEM makes a compelling case for inflation-proof stocks.Southern Company (SO)the southern company logo displayed several times on a screenSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comA gas and electric utility holding firm, Southern Company (NYSE:SO) offers, in my opinion, a no-brainer for stocks to beat inflation. Basically, the case for SO comes down to its underlying natural monopoly. According to Southern’s public profile, it serves nine million customers. You’re not just going to come in and compete with this enterprise.Another fundamental catalyst for SO – and one you should pay attention to if you want to buy stocks for inflation protection – is the necessity of the business. Unlike a discretionary purchase like an overpriced latte at a fancy coffee shop, you must pay your bills. Otherwise, you suffer a ripple effect that could easily ruin your life.Lastly, investors seeking to beat inflation with stocks should earmark SO. Not only does it provide an indelible business, but it also offers robust passive income. Currently, Southern carries a forward yield of 4.13%, above the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%.American Water Works (AWK)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comAnother candidate for no-brainer ideas for stocks to beat inflation, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is a public utility that provides water and wastewater services in the U.S. Per its corporate profile, the company serves approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states. Overall, the underlying user base comes out to about 14 million through 3.4 million customer connections.Again, if you want to buy stocks for inflation protection, you’ve got to think cynically. You’re looking for businesses that no matter what people must engage. Obviously, holistic water-related services represent one of the most important. If you don’t believe me, don’t pay your water bills. Let’s see how quickly that steamrolls into one giant pile.Primarily, American Water is indelible so it doesn’t need that much coaxing as it relates to inflation-proof stocks. But as a bonus, the company also carries a forward yield of 1.99%. While it’s lower than the utility sector’s average yield, American Water Works also commands 14 years of consecutive annual dividend increases.Valero Energy (VLO)3D rendered two black oil barrels on digital financial chart screen with yellow numbers and rising, green, falling, red arrows on black background. Oil stocksSource: stockwars / Shutterstock.comA downstream energy specialist, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) focuses mostly on manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels. While the political and ideological narrative has shifted toward the electrification of mobility, the harsh reality is that electric vehicles are still too expensive for average households. Plus, inflation would likely force consumers to make do with what they have, not go out and buy replacement vehicles.With people stuck with their combustion-powered vehicles, Valero should benefit cynically. Therefore, I anticipate VLO to rise as one of the stocks to beat inflation. Yes, shares have only gained about 6% since the Jan. opener. However, over the trailing one-year period, they’re up nearly 21%. Another benefit to targeting Valero as one of the inflation-proof stocks centers on its passive income. Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 3.22%. It’s a bit lower than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. However, you must also factor in the low payout ratio of 30.9%.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc.

As well, it’s consistently profitable with a trailing-year net margin of 21%. If you want to beat inflation with stocks, take a look at GOOG.Albertsons (ACI)Albertsons (ACI) store with logoSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWading into the riskier ideas for stocks to beat inflation, grocery giant Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) cuts a somewhat disappointing figure. Since the start of the year, ACI gained just a hair over 5%. During the trailing one-year period, shares slipped almost 20%. Nevertheless, the main fundamental catalyst of the trade-down effect should help invigorate sentiment.As a McKinsey &amp; Company report indicated earlier this year, consumers hurt by inflation are trading down. Basically, they’re forgoing expensive brands or stores for their lower-cost alternative. Eventually, I forecast you’ll see wholesale trade downs. In particular, people won’t be so eager to eat out at fancy restaurants. Instead, they’ll cook for themselves and their families.Also, while Albertsons presents significant risks, it also entices investors who want to buy stocks for inflation protection. Notably, the market prices ACI at a forward multiple of 7.76. As a discount to projected earnings, Albertsons ranks better than 96.83% of the defensive retail competition.CarParts.com (PRTS)A stack of auto partsSource: ShutterstockTo be upfront, online aftermarket auto parts provider CarParts.com (NASDAQ:PRTS) ranks among the riskiest ideas for stocks to beat inflation. It’s incredibly relevant because of the conditions impacting the consumer economy. However, since the Jan. opener, PRTS lost more than 28% of its equity value. During the trailing one-year period, PRTS gave up over 46%.At the same time, the fundamentals are aligning beautifully (albeit cynically) for CarParts.com. As data from S&amp;P Global Mobility showed, this year, the average age of passenger vehicles on U.S. roadways hit 12.5 years, a record. This dynamic confirms that people are hurting with higher prices. It’s not just “paper” pain. What’s more, the framework has a consequential effect on the auto parts industry. In other words, consumers are going to drive their incumbent vehicles until the wheels fall off. This factor alone should be a huge catalyst for PRTS. That’s why I’m including it on this list of inflation-proof stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

142,eac12c54-6f57-33b2-b6ab-92011c13bf61,UNP,2023-08-14,Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) Has Affirmed Its Dividend Of $1.30,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacific-nyse-unp-affirmed-103149103.html,1692009109,STORY,['UNP'],"[The board of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 29th of September, with investors receiving $1.30 per share. The dividend yield will be 2.3% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific Union Pacific's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Union Pacific's earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 28.2%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 41%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendUnion Pacific Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.38 total annually to $5.20. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 14% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To Come ByInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. However, things aren't all that rosy. It's not great to see that Union Pacific's earnings per share has fallen at approximately 5.3% per year over the past five years. Declining earnings will inevitably lead to the company paying a lower dividend in line with lower profits. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.Our Thoughts On Union Pacific's DividendOverall, a consistent dividend is a good thing, and we think that Union Pacific has the ability to continue this into the future. With shrinking earnings, the company may see some issues maintaining the dividend even though they look pretty sustainable for now. Taking all of this into consideration, the dividend looks viable moving forward, but investors should be mindful that the company has pushed the boundaries of sustainability in the past and may do so again.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the tech industry, head directly to Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.According to Gartner, the IT sector is expected to grow by 5.5% between 2022 and 2023. This means that the global tech industry is set to generate $4.6 trillion in spending this year, despite the rising cost of living. Deloitte observed that while other industries have started to adjust to pre-pandemic levels, the technology industry is still riding the pandemic highs. A survey conducted by the firm showed that the top three concerns for the tech industry over the next couple of years include macroeconomic factors, workforce-related problems, and geopolitical uncertainties. Per the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, US companies that plan to manufacture their own chips could receive financial assistance by the government. This is a welcome change given the global constraint in the supply for chips in the world. However, how this would impact the existing supply-chain relationships in the industry remains to be seen. Deloitte also expects strategic decisions to be made, regarding acquisitions and divesting, to focus on core product lines. Don't Miss: Top 12 Undervalued Tech Stocks According to AnalystsAs per McKinsey, the introduction of AI has taken the tech industry by storm. As more technology companies now explore enhancing their services through generative AI, the sector is provided with countless opportunities for growth and development. As per McKinsey’s estimates, AI-based services are expected to contribute $4.4 trillion in economic value. In addition, the tech industry saw over $1 trillion in combined investments since 2022. While the industry is poised for growth, recruiting top talent remains a major constraint for firms. Over the last year, job postings in the technology sector have increased by 15%. Some of the major areas for growth include Applied AI, Software Development, Trust Architecture, and Digital Identity, as per the McKinsey report. Artificial intelligence is the new buzz, with different kinds of applications for consumers, businesses, and industries around the world. As of last year, over $104 billion was recorded in equity investment in Applied AI, while job postings increased by 6% between 2021 and 2022. Similarly, over $2 billion was invested during 2022 in softwares to improve different processes. Meanwhile, the job postings increased by 29% for developers between 2021 and 2022. As the industry looks set for yet another wave of digital transformation, there is a heightened need for security and safety for data management. In line with that, roughly $47 billion was invested during 2022 for building safe architecture to protect cloud-based data from cyber breaches. Story continuesAlso read: 10 Best Financial and Fintech ETFs To BuyAccording to Forbes, there are a few major trends in the tech industry. Given the rising costs of living and other challenges of managing the workforce, one shared goal is to improve operational efficiency through machine learning and artificial intelligence within businesses. Next, the industry is moving towards developing tools that require no code. This is going to be beneficial for businesses and consumers to address their tech requirements, without a need for any experience in coding. Artificial intelligence is expected to improve further, as it gets incorporated into decision making, content generation, and editing. Consequently, AI can also be used for innovation in car-based applications, such as self-driving cars. Recently, the healthcare sector has capitalized on technological innovation as the industry undergoes digital transformation. As more cloud-based solutions are offered for different industries to better manage business processes, the tech industry is set to optimize operations across multiple sectors. With this industry outlook in mind, let's take a look  at Goldman Sachs’ top stock picks in the tech sector, which include the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Our Methodology We used Goldman Sachs’ Q1 2023 portfolio and selected the 12 biggest positions in tech firms during the quarter for this list. We have mentioned Goldman Sachs’ stake value and the hedge fund sentiment towards each stock as of the first quarter of 2023. The list is ranked in the ascending order of the firm’s stake value in each holding. Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 12 Stock PicksSource:PixabayGoldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top Stock Picks12. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Goldman Sachs' Stake Value: $1,640,035,093Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 138Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is a global leader in providing payment solutions worldwide. It provides secure and seamless authorisation and processing of payments internationally. On July 27, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) announced a Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $2.89 and a revenue of $6.3 billion, which outperformed market expectations by $0.06 and $130 million, respectively. At the end of Q1 2023, Goldman Sachs held 4.5 million shares of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) worth $1.64 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 138 hedge funds were bullish on Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), as opposed to 139 in the previous quarter. Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management held the largest position in the company, with 5.8 million shares worth $2.13 billion. Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is one of the top tech stock picks of Goldman Sachs.LVS Advisory made this comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We have owned Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) on and off since inception. We re-initiated the position in summer 2022 during the broader market sell-off. The stock traded off to an attractive valuation and we believed the tailwinds from a reopening of international travel still had legs. This was a small portfolio position and the stock has appreciated in the year we have owned it. The stock’s valuation is once again rich and the tailwinds from international travel and consumer spending appear to be tapering. We sold the position because we believe other opportunities within our existing portfolio will generate superior returns.”11. Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS)Goldman Sachs' Stake Value: $1,793,493,600Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) is a cybersecurity company that specializes in providing secure access solutions to protect customers from cyberattacks, data breaches, and data loss. On July 25, BTIG analyst Gray Powell upgraded Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) stock from Neutral to Buy, with a price target of $185. The analyst highlighted that recent on-site assessments of SSE have shown a consistent and lasting enhancement. At the conclusion of Q1 2023, Goldman Sachs held 17 million shares of Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) valued at $1.79 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 38 hedge funds were bullish on Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS). This number was 42 during the previous quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors held a prominent stake in the company, with over 1 million shares worth $122.6 million. Artisan Global Discovery Fund had this to say about Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) provides cloud-based Internet security solutions. In the quarter, it announced 54% revenue growth and expected growth of nearly 40% in 2023 (ahead of expectations). Despite solid fundamental momentum, shares have underperformed this year as investors have grown concerned about slowing demand for enterprise software as the broader global economy slows. We believe the dual trends of rising security vulnerability and increased enterprise digitization will lead to sustained demand, even in a recession. Cybersecurity remains a top concern for businesses and governments alike as cyberattacks can have devastating financial and reputational consequences. Meanwhile, managing the security needs of legacy on-premise applications, a growing number of cloud-based applications (Office 365, Salesforce, etc.) and a more remote workforce (versus pre-pandemic) make operating IT infrastructures increasingly complex. Give the attractive long-term outlook and depressed valuations, we added to the position.”10. Cisco Systems, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We had one sale this quarter, exiting network equipment company Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO). We chose to use the proceeds on more attractive value opportunities as Cisco’s growth has come in below what we had hoped for, and the company is increasingly looking at M&amp;A to augment its growth rate.”9.

We trimmed several of the year’s winners on strength, including Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, CoStar Group, Inc. (CSGP), and CarMax.”8. MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTSI)Goldman Sachs' Stake Value: $2,157,047,100Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 13MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTSI) is a provider of semiconductor solutions worldwide.

The company is led by a relatively new management team taking steps to accelerate topline growth and expand margins. The leadership team’s strategy is to addresses smaller, long-duration product cycle markets in which it can provide a differentiated offering, especially in compound semis such as GaAs, Al-GaAs, InP and GaN-on-SiC, using its design expertise and its US-trusted foundry / Department of Defense approved status. Rolling out several new, higher margin products and expanding into adjacent end markets such as auto and consumer should drive a compelling profit cycle in the periods ahead.”7. Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK)Goldman Sachs' Stake Value: $2,677,404,332Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) is a provider of cloud services, software based solutions, and cybersecurity worldwide.

(NASDAQ:SPLK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We exited our position in Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) during the quarter. A number of developments caused us to question whether Splunk’s competitive position was eroding. Splunk is a premium product, and less expensive alternatives have made progress increasing the quality of their offerings. Our research has confirmed Splunk is losing market share to these players, including Microsoft’s Sentinel. Sentinel has made a number of improvements over time and integrates with Microsoft’s other products. Notably, both of Splunk’s Co-Presidents left Splunk in 2022 to work for Microsoft. Splunk’s Chief Financial Officer left a few months later. Before the CFO left, Splunk lowered its annual recurring revenue guidance for the year. While the company attributed the change to the macro environment, we were unable to differentiate to what extent the slowdown was caused by the macro environment versus competitive factors. Based on our primary research and competitive concerns, we no longer had sufficient confidence in Splunk’s value stability. Splunk no longer qualifies for investment, and we exited the position.”6. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Goldman Sachs' Stake Value: $3,533,157,774Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 173Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is one of the market leaders in providing payment solutions across the globe.

(NYSE:V) is one of the top tech picks of Goldman Sachs.Manole Capital Management had this to say about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We like to start out all of our discussions by telling investors who we are. We are FINTECH investors, and we define Fintech as “anything utilizing technology to improve an established process.” We realize that half of Fintech is financial, but we don’t invest in traditional, credit sensitive banks. Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) or Mastercard, that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:10 Best Warehouse and Self-Storage Stocks To Buy10 Best Inexpensive Stocks To Buy Right Now10 Oversold Healthcare Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

Yahoo Finance will also feature a week-long special, Retail Evolution: The New Era, during our livestreaming programming beginning Monday morning.Last week, markets were mixed as August's lackluster trading continued during the month's first full week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) continued trudging higher, rising 0.6% on the week while the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both closed the week in the red.

That marked the first time since February 2021 that core CPI rose just 0.2% in consecutive months.""This month's soft core print confirms the disinflationary process,"" Morgan Stanley chief US economist Ellen Zentner wrote after the report on Thursday. ""After 6 months of 0.4% [month-over-month] prints, a second 0.16% [month-over-month increase] comes as a sign of continued deceleration.""Most Wall Street economists now see the Fed holding interest rates steady at its next meeting in September.Story continues""The Fed is attempting to fine tune the policy path as it gets close to the end of the hiking cycle and does not want to short-circuit the business cycle if inflation is already moving towards target,"" Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen wrote on Friday.The firm now expects the Fed will raise rates in November as opposed to next month, writing, ""An additional six weeks would give the Fed more time to assess the trajectory of the economy.""As of Friday afternoon, markets were pricing in a roughly 89% chance that the Fed holds steady at its September meeting, up from a 72% chance on July 11, per data from CME Group.The minutes from the Fed's July meeting, which will offer additional insight into how Fed officials see the future path of policy, are set for release at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday.Retail in focusFrom ""Barbie"" and Taylor Swift to economists pushing back or eliminating recession calls, a resilient consumer has been the story of the economy during the summer of 2023.Corporate results from major banks and some airlines have told a similar story too. There has been a slowdown, but in large part the consumer continues to spend more than most investors and economists had expected, leading to surprising growth in the American economy. This week will provide more key details on how Americans are spending and, more importantly, if companies think a second-half consumer slowdown is materializing.The July retail sales report is expected at 8:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday with economists anticipating sales increased 0.4% over the prior month. Retail sales increased 0.2% in June.""We expect a robust July sales report,"" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave wrote on Thursday, citing the company's credit and debit card data which showed spending was strong during the July 4 holiday. ""We forecast above-consensus increases of 0.7% and 0.6% in the Census Bureau's July figures for retail sales ex-autos and the core control group, respectively.""On the corporate side, investors will be looking to see if some of the cracks that appeared in the retail space three months ago have widened.In May, Home Depot warned consumers were completing smaller projects at home and buying fewer big-ticket items.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) Shares Could Be 28% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-csco-120038874.html,1691928038,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Cisco Systems is US$75.19 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCisco Systems is estimated to be 28% undervalued based on current share price of US$53.79 The US$56.78 analyst price target for CSCO is 24% less than our estimate of fair valueHow far off is Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$17.3bUS$18.1bUS$16.7bUS$17.3bUS$17.3bUS$17.5bUS$17.7bUS$17.9bUS$18.2bUS$18.6bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x8Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 0.16%Est @ 0.76%Est @ 1.17%Est @ 1.47%Est @ 1.67%Est @ 1.82% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$16.1kUS$15.7kUS$13.5kUS$13.1kUS$12.2kUS$11.5kUS$10.8kUS$10.2kUS$9.7kUS$9.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$122bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$19b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.2%) = US$371bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$371b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$184bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$306b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$53.8, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cisco Systems as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.021. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Cisco SystemsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Communications market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.
