Well, you’re in luck. While the market has been on a roller coaster ride, some stocks have been steadily performing and building momentum. Momentum stocks allow you to ride the wave of its trajectory and push your portfolio to the next level. You may not be able to capture the beginning of the trend, but that’s okay. You’d want those who have already established an upward push and take advantage of its remaining trend as long as possible.Now, how can you identify momentum stocks? The easiest way is to look at price performance. Look at companies performing well for a defined duration — week-to-date, month-to-date or year-to-date — depending on your investment period. Those looking for medium to long-term trends may want to use year-to-date (YTD) as a primary benchmark for performance. That lets you see the big picture, identifying which companies have been performing well since the start of the year. Like any strategy, momentum investing comes with risk, and it’s essential to consider your exit points in case the stock starts to turn. Still, the potential can be attractive. Let’s look at three momentum stocks worth checking out right now.Crane NXT (CXT)Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room. commercial real estateSource: GaudiLab / ShutterstockCrane NXT (NYSE:CXT) is an industrial technology company that offers various industrial solutions to its clients that help secure, authenticate and detect its customers’ significant assets.

The company operates into two segments: Crane Currency, which offers security solutions using its proprietary technology that helps secure physical products like banknotes and consumer goods, and Crane Payment Innovations (CPI), which offers software and electronic equipment that provide detection and sensing technologies for payment transactions, verification and various solutions.Story continuesInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCXT is running on strong and stable momentum with a YTD return of 53%, backed by excellent financial performance in the last two quarters. Its latest earnings release beat analyst expectations by 21.74%, and net sales grew by 7% year-over-year (YoY). Crane NXT expects further growth with its ongoing customer demand and backlogs and has raised its adjusted EPS guidance from $3.75 to $4.05 up to between $3.85 and $4.15. These solid results and ongoing performance put CXT on our momentum stocks to buy list.Verisk Analytics (VRSK)An image of a person typing at a kayboard with data overlaid, hand pointing toward dataSource: everything possible/ShutterstockVerisk Analytics (NASDAQ:VRSK) is a risk assessment and data analytics company that serves the insurance industry. Verisk leverages AI, machine learning and other advanced technologies to quickly analyze significant amounts of records to create analytics and insights that help its clients with risk management.

VRSK has also raised its guidance for its full-year outlook based on its strong performance for the year’s first half. Based on its 2nd quarter report, consolidated revenues were up by 10.1%, diluted GAAP earnings by 8.9% and diluted adjusted EPS by 18.9%. The company also received a lot of positive buzz, from releasing a first-of-its-kind predictive SRCC model to launching its ClaimSearch system in Israel. These developments and outlook have earned VRSK a spot in our top momentum stocks to buy.FleetCor Technologies (FLT)In this photo illustration the FleetCor Technologies logo seen displayed on a smartphone.

FLT also beat analyst expectations with its 7.86% EPS surprise. The company has also raised its full-year guidance, as it expects growth to continue till the end of the year. No wonder the stock is up 38% YTD.Earlier this year, FLT acquired a stake in Mina, a cloud-based EV charging software platform that helps capture, calculate and pay for at-home commercial charging directly with the energy provider.

2,85798ef3-719a-3cb4-bfa7-fa05c237526a,SCHW,2023-10-14,Is Schwab Health Care Fund (SWHFX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-health-care-fund-swhfx-110005366.html,1697194805,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Have you been searching for a Mutual Fund Equity Report fund? You might want to begin with Schwab Health Care Fund (SWHFX). SWHFX possesses a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerSWHFX is a part of the Schwab Funds family of funds, a company based out of San Francisco, CA. Schwab Health Care Fund debuted in June of 2000. Since then, SWHFX has accumulated assets of about $828.51 million, according to the most recently available information. Wei Li is the fund's current manager and has held that role since June of 2013.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. SWHFX has a 5-year annualized total return of 6.09% and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 5.8%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Compared to the category average of 17.07%, the standard deviation of SWHFX over the past three years is 15.34%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 15.69% compared to the category average of 18.72%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsWith a 5-year beta of 0.68, the fund is likely to be less volatile than the market average. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. With a negative alpha of -1.06, managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, SWHFX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.79% compared to the category average of 1.28%. From a cost perspective, SWHFX is actually cheaper than its peers.Investors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is $0 and that each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.Bottom LineOverall, Schwab Health Care Fund ( SWHFX ) has a neutral Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a somewhat average choice for investors right now.Your research on the Mutual Fund Equity Report segment doesn't have to stop here.

However, continued higher spending on the deployment of 5G networking and the rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality devices are catalysts. The growing need for faster connections, low latency and efficient battery life in wirelessly connected devices has been driving the demand for WiFi-enabled hotspots. The democratization of 5G smartphones has been a tailwind for the industry players. These factors have bolstered the demand for radio-frequency semiconductor solutions provided by industry players like Skyworks Solutions SWKS and Qorvo QRVO.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry comprises companies that provide radio frequency solutions, front-end modules, low-noise amplifiers, diodes, multi-chip modules, optical components, surface acoustic wave, bulk acoustic wave technology-based antenna-plexers and film bulk acoustic resonator filters to enable smartphone devices to function more efficiently in congested RF spectrum. They serve a wide array of industries with their solutions, finding ample applications in 5G and smartphone equipment, aerospace and defense, optical networks, cellular base stations, automotive and smart home applications. Most of these companies utilize robust wafer fabrication technologies, as well as ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, silicon germanium and Gallium Nitride technologies, to stay ahead of the competition.4 Trends Influencing the Prospects of the Semiconductors - RF IndustryAccelerated 5G Deployment is a Tailwind: The rapid implementation of 5G networking infrastructure and the robust adoption of cloud computing applications look promising for the wireless communication market. The coronavirus crisis-induced work-from-home wave has necessitated the need for higher bandwidth and triggered LTE advancements, which are expected to bolster the demand for RF power amplifiers. Increasing RF content in the latest 5G smartphones is a key catalyst. Further, the growing demand for WiFi hotspots, as the number of wirelessly connected devices increases in households, is enhancing industry prospects. Cisco forecasts that the number of hotspots worldwide will reach 600 million in 2023.Innovation is Opening up Business Avenues: The rapid proliferation of IoT, wearables, drones, VR/AR devices, autonomous cars and ADAS is expected to drive the demand for RF semiconductor products beyond smartphone devices, favoring industry prospects. Notably, RF Semiconductors are setting the pace for technology modernization by consequently digitizing aspects like connectivity, healthcare, transport and defense. The diversified utilization of RF Semiconductor products bodes well for the industry players. Moreover, the evolution of semiconductor manufacturing processes from 10 nanometers (nm) to 7 nm, and even 5 nm and 3 nm technology, is anticipated to bolster the industry prospects. Further, the rollout of bands and band combinations has led to considerable design challenges for OEM smartphone manufacturers. The industry participants are looking to address these challenges with a robust range of antenna-plexer portfolios utilizing the BAW technology.Growing Adoption of Electric Vehicles Aids Prospect: Industry players are gaining from the increasing inclusion of their products in electric vehicles (EVs). The market for EVs is expected to expand fourfold by 2027.Supply-Chain and Higher Commodity Costs to Hinder Prospects: The industry players are reeling under the impact of supply-chain constraints, as well as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with NKE.As of 2023-10-13, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $457.19. It's currently trading at a price of $482.56. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -5.55%. The company is fair valued.The Art of Valuation: Discovering Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc's Intrinsic ValueThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$14.63GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.62%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 20.30% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=233.86Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=232.62Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=457.19Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $359.52. This valuation indicates that the Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -34.22%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

To skip the detailed analysis, head over to the 5 Most Common Reasons You’re Likely to Get Fired.With the changing organizational structures and evolving market shifts, having a stable job today isn’t as easy as it used to be. There are several key reasons why people might lose their jobs, and it’s essential for both workers and companies to understand these to keep jobs secure and businesses running smoothly.A survey by Airtasker reveals that around 32% of people got fired from a job in their lifetime due to multiple reasons. The most common, according to survey participants, included personality conflict, office politics, poor performance, weak attendance, and poor management.The struggles don’t just come from individual or corporate level reasons. Big shifts in the world’s economy and changes within organizations themselves can also make jobs less secure.For instance, a PwC study shows that 114 million people around the globe lost their jobs in 2020, mainly due to lockdowns and business shutdowns followed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The same study highlights that the low-skilled sector suffered the most loss while high-skilled sectors witnessed growth, showing that less skilled or less experienced people have their set of challenges.Another report by Laysoff.fyi shows that layoffs in the tech industry reached around 240,000 in 2023. These cuts happened among 1059 tech companies, including big names like Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft. These companies have made news not only for their successes but also because they had to let a significant number of employees go.For instance, in an effort to cut costs, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) discharged around 12,000 team members (6% of its crew) in January 2023. Oddly enough, just since 2021, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has hired over 50,000 new employees due to a pandemic-driven surge in demand for their services. However, the company said it is more focused on stabilizing its business and investing in top tech and engineering talent. And it seems to be paying off – Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) disclosed a nearly 7% revenue spike year over year in the second quarter of 2023.Story continuesMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), another example, has laid off around 21,000 employees since November last year amidst soaring inflations and slowing revenue growth. The company let go of 11000 employees in the first half of 2023 in an effort to save money and be more efficient.Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another tech giant that laid off around 10,000 employees in 2023. On the financial side, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported 11% year on year increase in net sales in the second quarter of 2023. Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) also reported a net income of $6.7 billion in Q2 2023 as compared to a net loss of $2 billion a year earlier.While layoffs have been on the rise in recent years, some companies like Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) and AT&amp;T Inc (NYSE:T) are making efforts to train their employees in new and advanced skills to stay relevant to technological advancements and market changes.Over the past five years, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) has dedicated more than $140 million to create skill-based systems that extend beyond the company. Looking forward, the retail giant Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) has set a substantial goal to invest $1 billion in workforce training and development by 2026. Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) is committed to empowering its associates by providing them with free certificates, the opportunity to earn degree credits through on-the-job learning, and access to the Walmart Academy. Additionally, through Walmart.org, the company is actively contributing to the growth of a skills-based ecosystem.AT&amp;T Inc (NYSE:T) has a history of commitment to workforce development and training. In 2018, AT&amp;T Inc (NYSE:T) introduced the ""Future Ready"" initiative, with an investment of approximately $1 billion to upskill its workforce to be adept in emerging technological domains like cloud computing, cybersecurity, and data analytics. Collaborative ventures, such as partnering with the online platform Udacity to establish the ""Nanodegree"" program, further show AT&amp;T Inc (NYSE:T)'s strategic approach to ensure continuous employee development.15 Most Common Reasons You're Likely to Get FiredAntonio Guillem/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of the 15 most common reasons you’re likely to get fired, we sifted through around 11,000 comments from a Reddit thread. We made this termination reasons list based on repeating patterns across multiple comments. To find relevant threads, we used search terms like “most common reasons you’re likely to get fired” and “why did you get fired” within the r/AskReddit subreddit, and picked the most recent and engaging thread for our analysis.Below is our list of the 15 most common reasons you’re likely to get fired, based on experiences shared by Redditors.15 Most Common Reasons You're Likely to Get Fired15. Misuse of Company TimeMisusing company time, like engaging in personal activities during work hours, can be a major red flag for employers. Spending hours shopping online, playing games, or scrolling through social media, instead of working, can land you in hot water.Employees are paid for their time and expertise and using that time for personal gain instead of contributing to the company gives employers a valid reason for firing an employee. After all, time is money, and bosses expect you to give it your all while you’re on the clock.One Redditor, while sharing their firing story, mentioned getting let go “for finishing work too fast and then just sitting around.” Another chimed in with,""Back in the day, I got busted playing WoW during work hours.""14. Health IssuesSometimes, having ongoing health issues might get you fired if they stop you from doing your job right. Employers might try to find you a different role or make some adjustments first, but that doesn’t always work out.Lots of folks on Reddit have said they were let go just for being sick. One person shared,""I had pneumonia and a doctor's note. Came back to work a week later, still wheezing and using an inhaler. Got fired the next week.""Another person shared that they were canned because their boss didn’t think workers should get sick. Even having a minor stroke got someone fired. It's pretty heartless, but that’s just how it goes in some places.13. Being Drunk at WorkThis is one of the top things that will get you fired immediately. Rolling into work buzzed or drunk isn't just bad for getting stuff done; it's also a danger zone for everyone around. It's a big no-no in pretty much every workplace. Besides messing up your ability to work, being sauced at the office shows you're not taking things seriously and kind of throwing professionalism out the window.One Redditor shared they got fired due to “Alcohol problems that popped up during the pandemic.” Another mentioned they got caned for being drunk.12. LayoffsLayoffs are one of the major reasons for termination without a cause. They usually have less to do with individual performance and more with the company's financial health or structural changes. Sometimes, due to economic downturns, management changes, or shifts in company strategy, layoffs become inevitable to keep the company afloat. During layoffs, teams or entire departments may be eliminated to cut costs or restructure the organization.One Redditor shared their bit, saying,""We formed a union, then when the pandemic hit, all of us in the union found ourselves laid off.""Another chimed in with,""Covid-19 rolled around and the company had to lay off people left and right.""11. Asking for a RaiseWhile this is not a common reason people are likely to get fired over, sometimes pushing too hard for a raise or over-negotiating your salary can be perceived negatively, especially if it's not matched by your performance.One Redditor spilled the beans, saying,""After consistently pulling 60-70 hour weeks, HR still turned me down for a raise. Not a month later, they wanted a meeting to 'mutually part ways' cause apparently, my work wasn’t getting done.""Another added their story, mentioning they got the ax because they told their boss flat out that they were doing too much work for too little pay – a problem for everyone who never sticks around.10. RetaliationRetaliation—when employers illicitly punish employees for engaging in activities that might be legally protected, like whistleblowing or filing complaints—can be subtle or overt. Sadly, some individuals might still face retaliation in various forms, such as getting fewer hours, being demoted, or even getting fired in extreme cases.One Redditor shared their story, saying they got canned “For reporting harassment.” Another revealed they were let go because they backed their buddy’s letter about some wage theft.If you ever find yourself in such a spot, it’s key to keep a tight record of everything that goes down.9. Lack of Productivity or MotivationThis is one of the top 10 reasons employees get fired. People who consistently show a lack of productivity or low motivation might end up being seen as a drain on a company. Employers and team members rely on each individual to contribute to the overall success of the team.Lack of motivation not only affects your work but could also knock down team morale and the vibe of the whole workplace, potentially creating a domino effect of dropping productivity. Habitual underproductivity also signals to employers that you’re not invested in your role, which may make them question your fit within the company.However, it looks like unproductivity or lack of motivation sometimes stems from some genuine reasons. Take this one Redditor’s experience for instance. They shared,""I worked at a car dealership in college. Sold a Ford Raptor for like 80k and the commission was a measly $200. After that, I’d just hit the desk and study. Didn’t try to sell anything else. Knew I’d get fired, but it took them 2 months to notice I’d done zilch since selling that Raptor.""And sometimes it's personal stuff getting in the way of work. Another user opened up about this, admitting,""My depression made me super unproductive. In the worst stretches, I maybe cranked out one productive hour in a whole week.""8. StealingThis one’s clear: taking anything that doesn’t belong to you from the workplace is a huge breach of trust and can get you fired immediately. Theft can range from taking physical items to misusing company time or stealing intellectual property.Employees who steal from their employers might also face legal consequences, depending on the value and nature of what was taken. This is an unequivocal breach of professional ethics, and likely to have serious repercussions, not just in your current job but potentially on your future employment prospects as well.7. Confronting ManagementWhile healthy discussions are encouraged, sometimes opposing or confronting management without a constructive approach may lead to being let go.Then there's another layer, where standing against management — especially when it comes to ethical matters — can still be risky if not approached cautiously. Consider this Redditor’s experience who""Got fired for not only calling the health inspector but posting pics of many food safety violations on FB while tagging the restaurant in the post while on the clock in the restaurant.""Here, while the intention to ensure food safety is commendable, the public and inflammatory approach used resulted in termination.6. UnderperformanceConsistently falling short of expected performance levels is a common reason for dismissal. Underperformance not only impacts individual progress but can also bog down the entire team's momentum. Employers typically look for consistent, reliable work output and might conduct periodic reviews to ensure employees are meeting their performance benchmarks.Sometimes underperformance is about clear, professional missteps, as a Redditor acknowledged they were dismissed because they""Missed a major deadline while letting other things slip.""But sometimes it can be due to a genuine personal crisis, as shared by another Redditor that they were fired because they missed a lot of work because their wife got cancer. It also shows the lack of empathy by some employers.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Common Reasons You’re Likely to Get Fired.

Instead of setting up a new milk processing facility in the Upper Midwest, heart of dairy country, it has decided to set up shop in Valdosta, Georgia. Bold choice. Knowing Walmart, there is a reason for the move to the South. That reason would be increased access to Walmart and Sam’s Club stores in the Southeast.This new facility will focus strictly on milk processing and will create 400 jobs for the Valdosta community. It’s expected to service more than 750 Walmart and Sam’s Club stores. It’s Walmart’s second plant exclusively for processing milk, the first being in Fort Wayne, Indiana.Walmart is looking to take similar steps with other commodities.

I'm senior health reporter Angela Khemlani. And I just came back from the health conference in Las Vegas, which has grown every year, signaling the importance that digital health and AI are going to be playing in our future health care. I spoke to a number of experts who told me that investors and founders are really struggling with trying to figure out where the next big bet is.To that end, Vineeta Agarwal, Andreessen Horowitz's general partner talked to me about the role that medical experts are going to play in that role. Listen to what she had to say.VINEETA AGARWAL: We're looking at an overstretched health care workforce. I'm a primary care physician myself. The inbox volume that most providers today are receiving from patients who appropriately have an expectation that they will be heard and heard quickly is almost unmanageable. And yet when we look at our national statistics of number of providers per capita or health outcomes on that basis, we fall short. And we don't actually have numerically a provider shortage in this country.Story continuesAnd so we are left with this strange sort of situation and tale of two cities, so to speak, which is that we've got lots of providers and yet we're not achieving the health care outcomes and patient experiences that we want nor the cost reduction that we want. And so bridging those exact two worlds, we think of a host of provider enablement technologies like AI that can be a co-pilot to our providers, that can take administrative burden off of our providers plates, that can interface directly with patients in meaningful ways when providers otherwise wouldn't be able to. And all of those use cases we think are going to be powered by new and next generation AI models in a really impactful way.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: But how this uncharted territory is going to be regulated by the federal government is still a big question that the industry is plagued with. And so I spoke with Amy Abernethy, the chief medical officer of Verily as well as a former FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner about just how the government has to take a look at that. Listen to what she had to say.AMY ABERNETHY: FDA has been thinking about this and really trying to build its story of how they're thinking about it for a while now, for example, published an important paper in 2019 around their thinking in AI and ML capabilities. But some of the capabilities that we see now hitting the stage all across the health conference, right, have really started to accelerate the pace of being able to be brought into the health care space. And we're at this interesting place where FDA is trying to in real time develop the point of view of what regulation is going to look like while what I call the speeding train of all of the AI based software medical products are coming down towards this tiny tunnel of regulatory, capability, and scale. And it's to be an important time.The last thing I'd say is as a tech developer, you know, I think about this from the perspective of, yes, in fact FDA does have the responsibility as a public health agency. And so how do we as tech innovators help with that story as opposed to be afraid of it.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: But technology isn't the only thing changing health. We all know that Amazon is really making a move into this $4 trillion industry, stoking fears about how exactly it will disrupt the space and how it changes how we access care. I spoke about that with Neil Lindsey, the Senior Vice President of Amazon Health Services. Listen in.NEIL LINDSAY: Well, our mission is not to disrupt anything. We don't go into anything with the idea that that's a goal. Our goal is to--ANJALEE KHEMLANI: You should tell everyone that because they're all convinced you're going to disrupt it.NEIL LINDSAY: Well, we don't have a magic wand. What we do is we look at what are the experiences that need to be improved that we can make a difference in. And know what we're good at is connecting the dots, connecting the dots between people as customers and humans to the products and services they need. We do that in a general sense.And in health care, the need is the same, right? We need to connect the dots. Remembering also that 60% of everything we sell on Amazon is sold by a third party. So we don't need to do it all ourselves. No, we'll do things first party where we believe we can elevate the experience. So Amazon Pharmacy, One Medical, we believe are elevated experiences where we can take our expertise and make a difference.When we-- in Amazon we often talk about selection, value, and convenience as key to making things easier. In health care, I've translated that to choice, convenience, and continuity of care, that choice is important because it gives customers agency. One of the things that in a retail environment, customers do have agency. They have informed choice.Patients don't always feel like they have agency. They don't feel like they have choice. So we need to give them choice. Secondly is convenience. Convenience is key because if it's easy, people will engage. If they engage, they'll get better health outcomes. If they don't, they won't. And the problem is it's hard to engage right now.If it takes three or four weeks to get an appointment, if you have to line up with 15 other people who are not feeling well at a pharmacy and wait 20 minutes to get your medications, it's not easy. People aren't going to do it. They're just going to not get well. And it's costing us a fortune as an economy.So-- and then the final point is continuity of care. Ultimately, we all need and deserve that continuity of care that a service like One Medical provides. But to be clear, we're excited by wherever anyone gets their care. There is so much need in health care to make it easier, that we're working hard to do it in whatever way we can. And I celebrate anyone else who's making a difference in making it easier.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Speaking of making it easier, Wegovy, Novo Nordisk's very popular weight loss drug has taken the world by storm, making a lot easier for people to lose weight. But Hims &amp; Hers is a popular telehealth platform known for its discreet prescription packaging isn't buying into the frenzy. I spoke with the chief medical officer Dr. Patrick Carroll and here's what he explained about why.PATRICK CARROLL: What we've realized though also with the GLP-1s and GIPs and a direct to consumer model, they're unaffordable. And quite honestly, the supply chain is a mess. Can you even access those? We have real doubts about that. And there are some side effects that are coming out that are concerning.So we wanted to kind of wait, you know? Slow down a little bit on going right to GLP-1s and GIPs. And so what we decided to do is to bring in an expert to guide us through this bill. We brought in a guy, physician senior vice president of weight management, Craig Premack. He reports to me.He's built weight management clinics in Arizona. He has experienced. He's a national leader in this. And Craig came to us and said, look, you don't have to double down on GLP-1s and GIPs. There are good generic medications if used appropriately and the appropriate dose, and bundle that with a great education program, that you can have a holistic offering in weight management that is effective and affordable.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Affordability and Walmart. We know those two go hand in hand. Well, Walmart last week talked about these weight loss drugs and the potential impact on food sales. But I spoke with the chief medical officer Dr. Jon Wigeswaran about the long term effects and what other impacts they expect from these weight loss drugs. Listen in.JON WIGESWARAN: If you're dealing with people that have significant obesity and they have a risk of a cardiac event and other cardiovascular events, then having medications that reduce weight are really important. So I think on one hand, it's a great option for patients. On the other hand, we're still learning as an industry what these meds are about. So I had a career in pharma before I came to Walmart. And when you have a new medication that you're applying across millions of people, they're going to be things that you don't know.So I think all in all, great for patients. But I think what we're all trying to learn, and particularly here where we're seeing patients trying to be very cognizant, that we've got to learn more before we do more.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: And while he didn't exactly address the claims about the impact to food sales we have heard in the past week that those claims may be a little bit overblown, still waiting for more details on the data that Walmart used. But all told, really an interesting field of AI, digital health, and other aspects of the health care system, making it much easier for us today as patients to access the health care system. We'll be keeping an eye on all that and more for the future, of course.]"

WMT is known for its unparalleled efforts toward enriching customers’ experiences and catering to their demands. The omnichannel retailer goes all the way to undertake relevant innovation to keep up with customers’ needs. In the latest move, Walmart unveiled plans to introduce an owned and operated milk processing facility in Valdosta, GA, which is expected to break ground later this year.With this facility, the company aims to serve customers’ burgeoning demand for superior-quality milk. This innovative facility in Valdosta will also solidify Walmart’s supply chain and help the company make sourcing more transparent.Creating nearly 400 jobs at Walmart, the upcoming facility will utilize locally sourced ingredients to handle the processing and packaging of a diverse range of milk choices. These include gallon, half-gallon, whole, 2%, 1%, skim and 1% chocolate milk under Walmart's Great Value and Sam's Club's Member's Mark brands. These products will be distributed to more than 750 Walmart stores and Sam's Clubs located in the Southeast region.Incidentally, WMT inaugurated its first milk processing plant in Fort Wayne, IN, in 2018. In subsequent endeavors, the company expanded its investments by launching its inaugural case-ready beef facility in Thomasville, GA, and constructing a second case-ready beef facility in Olathe, KS. Additionally, Walmart forged equity investments and established long-term commercial partnerships with Sustainable Beef LLC (a rancher-owned enterprise) and a vertical farming company, Plenty.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFocus on Elevating Customers’ ExperienceWalmart has been pushing the edge out of the envelope with regard to its e-commerce efforts.

At Sam’s Club, e-commerce sales jumped 18% on strong curbside performance.Noteworthy milestones for Walmart include the acquisition of a significant stake in Flipkart, which has been bolstering its International segment. Walmart's majority ownership of India's digital transaction platform, PhonePe, is also significant.Additionally, Walmart is making aggressive efforts to expand in the booming online grocery space, which has long been a major contributor to e-commerce sales. By the second quarter of fiscal 2024, Walmart U.S. had nearly 4,600 pickup locations and more than 4,000 same-day delivery stores.All said, the abovementioned milk facility highlights Walmart’s commitment to upgrade its offerings and resonate with customers’ needs while keeping its pricing affordable.

Sustainability will also be under the executive’s direction.More from Footwear NewsWhy Stephen Curry's New Signature Basketball Shoe Marks the 'Future of Curry'How Under Armour's Stephanie Linnartz Applies Lessons Learned at Marriott to Her New Role“Shawn is a retail industry powerhouse who comes to Under Armour at this critical time with the breadth and depth of experience that we need to optimize the backbone of our business, the supply chain, to ensure that our consumers get the right products, at the right price, at the right time,” said Linnartz in a statement.Curran, who spent 30 decades at Gap Inc., was most recently Old Navy’s COO, where he oversaw 44,000 associates across 1,200 stores and managed end-to-end operations, inventory management and sourcing. Throughout his tenure at the San Francisco apparel giant, he held several roles across the Gap portfolio, including serving as COO and head of global supply chain across all seven of the firm’s brands.For its part, Under Armour has been rolling out a business transformation plan throughout 2023.

Women in finance tout mentorship and AI as worthwhile diversity efforts, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty emphasizes skill-based hiring, and Fortune senior writer Maria Aspan tells us why a Marriott veteran took a risk to become Under Armour's new CEO. Enjoy your weekend!- Leap of faith. Back in February, when Marriott president Stephanie Linnartz left the hotel chain after 25 years to become the chief executive of sportswear retailer Under Armour, my initial reaction was: “Huh. Yes, it’s a CEO job—but why this one?”So for this year’s Most Powerful Women issue of Fortune, I sat down with Linnartz to ask exactly that question—and to examine the landscape for ambitious, experienced female executives like Linnartz who want to become CEOs, but who still get far fewer opportunities than their male counterparts.“I always had this idea that the rewards of taking risks are, the great majority of the time, worth it,” Linnartz told me in late August, from her sunny new corner office at Under Armour headquarters in Baltimore.After all, she wanted to be a CEO—and when the Under Armour job opened up, “I was ready to take that next leap.”Stephanie Linnartz, President and Chief Executive Officer of Under Armour at their headquarters in Baltimore, MDLinnartz had spent almost her entire career at Marriott, where she climbed to become No. 2 and the most senior woman at the world’s largest hotel chain. At Under Armour, she’s jumping to a struggling and much smaller company—one where she’s effectively the third CEO in four years to work for executive chairman and founder Kevin Plank. The company’s sales growth has stagnated; its share price has plunged 87% from its 2015 high; its once-buzzy brand is seen as anywhere from “inconsistent” (per Linnartz) to “second-tier” (per analysts); and its founder—who “stepped down” as CEO at the start of 2020 but who still owns 65% of the company’s voting shares—continues to land Under Armour in unflattering headlines.So Linnartz is taking on a big turnaround job, on all sorts of fronts. She’s also following her longtime advice to other women on how to advance in corporate America: “Take the toughest, most difficult job or project someone can give you, because that’s how you move ahead,” is how Linnartz described her career philoso­phy to Fortune’s Leigh Gallagher eight years ago.Story continuesTaking on those sorts of jobs doesn’t always go as planned—as we have recently been reminded by the cases of Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino, former Walgreens CEO Roz Brewer, and the broader data-backed phenomenon of the “glass cliff.” But her friends and colleagues are betting that Linnartz is up to the challenge at Under Armour. As Accenture CEO Julie Sweet, No. 2 on this year’s MPW list and a longtime business partner of Linnartz’s, told me: “She knows what the challenges are—and she’s going to absolutely overcome them.”For more of Linnartz’s strategy to do so, read my full profile here.

MMC is set to continue its earnings beat streak for the third quarter of 2023, the results for which are scheduled to be released on Oct 19, before the opening bell.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share of $1.38 has witnessed two upward revisions in the past week against one movement in the opposite direction. The estimate is indicative of a 17% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported earnings of $1.18 per share. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.2 billion, suggesting a rise of 8.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Marsh &amp; McLennan’s earnings beat estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 3.4%. This is depicted in the graph below.Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMarsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMarsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. QuoteWhat the Quantitative Model Suggests   Our proven model predicts a likely earnings beat for Marsh &amp; McLennan this time around as well. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is precisely the case here.Earnings ESP: Marsh &amp; McLennanhas anEarnings ESP of +0.56%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at $1.39 per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Marsh &amp; McLennan currently has a Zacks Rank #3.Before we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at MMC’s previous-quarter performance first.Q2 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, this globally leading insurance broker company’s adjusted earnings per share of $2.20 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8%, primarily on the back of strong performance in the Risk and Insurance Services segment, led by the Marsh business' robust international operations. A well-performing Consulting unit also contributed to the upside. However, an elevated expense level acted as a partial offset to the results.Story continuesNow, let us see how things have shaped up prior to the third-quarter earnings announcement.Factors Driving Q3 PerformanceThe third-quarter top-line performance of Marsh &amp; McLennan is anticipated to have been boosted by robust showings in its Risk and Insurance Services, as well as Consulting segments. The Risk and Insurance Services segment is expected to have gained on the back of solid contributions from its Marsh and Guy Carpenter sub-divisions. MMC's performance in the third quarter is likely to have received a significant boost from robust operations in the international market, with a particular focus on Latin America and Asia.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Risk and Insurance Services segment indicates a rise of 11.3% from the prior-year quarter’s level of $2,838 million, whereas our estimate suggests a 12% jump. Also, the consensus mark for the segment’s adjusted operating income suggests an almost 23% increase from the prior-year quarter’s figure of $562 million, whereas our model indicates a nearly 27% rise.The Consulting segment of Marsh &amp; McLennan is anticipated to have gained momentum in the third quarter, driven by the impressive performance of its sub-unit, Oliver Wyman. The performance of the Oliver Wyman sub-unit is likely to have been bolstered by several strategic acquisitions aimed at enhancing its capabilities and expanding its geographic presence. Also, sequentially improving returns from Wealth and Health operations are likely to have aided the Mercer (another sub-unit of the Consulting segment) business in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of the Mercer sub-division indicates a 4.6% increase from the prior-year quarter’s level of $1,284 million, while the same for the Oliver Wyman business' revenues indicates 6% growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the overall Consulting segment’s revenues indicates growth of more than 5% from the prior-year quarter’s $1,951 million, whereas our estimate for the metric suggests a 4.5% rise. Also, the consensus mark for the segment’s adjusted operating income is pegged at $384.8 million, suggesting 6.3% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.The factors stated above are expected to have positioned the company for not only year-over-year growth in the third quarter but also a likely earnings beat. However, the positives are anticipated to be partially offset by increasing expenses. Our estimate for total operating expenses in the quarter under review suggests a 7.6% year-over-year jump.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies worth considering from the broader Finance space, as our model shows that these, too, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Aon plc AON has an Earnings ESP of +1.12% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AON’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $2.24 per share, which witnessed one upward estimate revision in the past week against none in the opposite direction. The consensus estimate for AON’s revenues is pegged at $2.9 billion, suggesting a 6.7% increase from a year ago.Brown &amp; Brown, Inc. BRO has an Earnings ESP of +4.92% and a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Brown &amp; Brown’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 61 cents per share, indicating 22% year-over-year growth. The estimate remained stable over the past week. BRO beat earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters and missed once, with an average surprise of 4%.The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. HIG has an Earnings ESP of +1.61% and a Zacks Rank of 2.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hartford Financial’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.95 per share, suggesting a 35.4% year-over-year increase. The estimate witnessed three upward estimate revisions in the past week against one in the opposite direction.

19,bbb4fd08-66f1-3480-bc3c-bb48f83f2d44,HBAN,2023-10-14,Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huntington-bancshares-hban-expected-beat-140009437.html,1697205609,STORY,['HBAN'],"[The market expects Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis regional bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.32 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -18%.Revenues are expected to be $1.82 billion, down 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.15% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Huntington Bancshares?For Huntington Bancshares, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.80%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Huntington Bancshares will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Huntington Bancshares would post earnings of $0.34 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.35, delivering a surprise of +2.94%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Huntington Bancshares appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry, First Western (MYFW), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.44 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -33.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $25 million, down 14.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for First Western has been revised 8.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that First Western will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Russia is still waging war against Ukraine, the Middle East has seen a war breakout between Israel and Hamas, and strains between the US and China remain elevated.The new record high also comes as oil prices have also jumped in recent months, with Brent crude up 24% since June. That's as top OPEC+ producers Saudi Arabia and Russia have curbed supplies.What's perhaps most impressive about the steady surge in oil production is the fact that the weekly US oil rig count remains well below the 2014 peak of more than 1,600 rigs. There were just 502 active oil rigs in the US last week, representing a 69% decline from the 2014 peak. That shows just how efficient America's energy industry has become after a period of depressed oil prices from 2014 through 2021.""Crude production is cyclical, but over the last decade and a half has registered a strong uptrend relative to operating rigs or employment in the oil and gas industry. This is a powerful form of technological progress and productivity growth,"" Comerica Bank chief economist Bill Adams told Insider on Thursday.There are plenty of economic benefits to America as it consistently becomes a net exporter of crude oil. Adams highlighted that it makes America's economy more resilient and reduces the chance of a recession in 2024.It also reduces the risk of 1970s-style stagflation, which was in part driven by oil supply shocks.Story continues""Unlike in the 1970s, the US is a net exporter of petroleum products. That means that the trade deficit now tends to narrow as petroleum prices rise, supporting the value of the US dollar and reducing prices of imports and related inflation pressures,"" Adams said.""Rising energy output will be a tailwind to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2023, and will contribute to lower risk of a US recession in 2024.""Read the original article on Business Insider]"

30,51f43ff9-0a6e-3027-81a7-475f33fa5571,OMC,2023-10-14,Interpublic Group (IPG) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/interpublic-group-ipg-earnings-expected-140008017.html,1697205608,STORY,"['IPG', 'OMC']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Interpublic Group (IPG) reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis marketing and advertising company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +19.1%.Revenues are expected to be $2.4 billion, up 4.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.28% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Interpublic?For Interpublic, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.77%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Interpublic will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Interpublic would post earnings of $0.60 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of +23.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Interpublic doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsOmnicom (OMC), another stock in the Zacks Advertising and Marketing industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.86 for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +5.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.57 billion, up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Omnicom has been revised 0.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.04%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Omnicom will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with CRM.As of 2023-10-13, Salesforce Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $18.35. It's currently trading at a price of $205.68. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -1020.87%. The company is significantly overvalued.Navigating Market Uncertainty: Intrinsic Value of Salesforce IncThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Salesforce Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$1.59GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.62%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=9.36Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=3.98Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=18.35Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $239.41. This valuation indicates that the Salesforce Inc is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 14.09%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Volatility continues in October as the Fed warned of one more rate hike of 25 basis points by the end of this year and a higher interest rate regime for a longer period. The first rate cut is not expected before September 2024 and the inflation rate is unlikely to decline to the central bank’s target rate of 2% before 2026.However, the inflation rate has been systematically dwindling since its peak in June 2022, barring some minor fluctuations. This indicates that the Fed’s policy of tight monetary control and a higher interest rate regime is finally paying off.Moreover, October is historically known as being favorable to U.S. stock markets.

37,4b9f6e2c-81ab-3d20-8dcf-5ef9070cb9e8,MSI,2023-10-14,Nokia (NOK) Unveils Advanced 25G PON Sealed Fiber Access Node,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nokia-nok-unveils-advanced-25g-160400185.html,1697213040,STORY,"['NOKIA.HE', 'NVDA', 'ANET', 'MSI']","[Nokia Corporation NOK recently introduced the industry’s first 25G PON (Passive Optical Network) technology for Lightspan SF-8M sealed fiber access node. These sealed fiber access nodes are vital components of fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) networks, directly linking high-speed fiber optic cable to individual residences or businesses.With Nokia’s Quillion chipset at its core, the Lightspan SF offers a fiber access node that delivers high throughput and low latency with exceptional deployment flexibility. It can be easily mounted on a stand, on a pole, on a wall, or inside or outside a cabinet. High adaptability and easy installation process of remote FTTH nodes empower operators to swiftly capitalize on commercial opportunities and maximize revenue potential.Its passive cooling feature ensures energy efficiency and minimizes the risk of power failure. The solution supports a wide range of powering options, such as redundant coax or triple power (AC, DC and RFT-V).  Carriers often face various difficulties in today’s ever-changing market dynamics. With the growing proliferation of high data-intensive applications, demand for higher bandwidth and improved service reliability is rising among both residential and enterprise customers. However, frequent upgradation of the system is a costly endeavor.The multigigabit sealed fiber access node is optimized for a wide array of PON technologies, including GPON, XGS-PON, Multi-PON and 25G PON. This enables cable operators to rapidly match the changing bandwidth demand and stay ahead of the competition. Along with unmatched capacity, this 25G PON seamlessly facilitates various commercial use cases, including network slicing, symmetrical 10 Gb/s enterprise services, mobile transport and more.The large centralized OLTs (optical line terminals) often face difficulties related to high latency, and congestion and any single point failure can lead to widespread service disruptions. Remote, small OLTs can reduce latency by bringing the network closer to end users and enhancing performance. It also boosts network resilience, as failure in a particular location won’t affect the whole system. Moreover, it offers operators more flexibility in terms of scaling and upgrading, making them a cost-efficient option for network expansion.Nokia boasts a leadership position in the XGS-PON equipment market, with its solutions powering a significant portion of fiber broadband connections in North America. The company’s proactive approach to quickly identify loopholes in the legacy systems and encourage rapid innovation to address client’s concerns will likely enhance  its commercial horizon.The company is driving the transition of global enterprises into smart virtual networks by creating a single network for all services, converging mobile and fixed broadband, IP routing and optical networks with the software and services to manage them. Leveraging state-of-the-art technology, it is transforming the way people and things communicate and connect with each other.Nokia aims to create new business and licensing opportunities in the consumer ecosystem. To strengthen its leading position in the market, Nokia facilitates its customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations by offering easy programmability and flexible automation needed to support dynamic operations, reduce complexity and improve efficiency. It seeks to expand its business into targeted, high-growth and high-margin vertical markets to address growth opportunities beyond its traditional primary markets.The stock has declined 20% in the past year compared with the industry’s fall of 5%.Story continuesNokia currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderMotorola Solutions, Inc.

VSAT recently offered an update on key operational metrics and reiterated its guidance for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. With the realization of synergistic benefits from the successful integration of Inmarsat over the next fiscal year, the company expects to reach the inflection point of sustainable positive free cash flow in the first half of 2025 rather than the second half, as anticipated earlier. Such positive feelers seemed to have hit the right investor chords, as share prices were up nearly 7.5% to close at $16.20 as of Oct 12, 2023.In fiscal 2025, Viasat expects to record synergies to the tune of $80 million in annual operating expenses and around $110 million in annual capital expenditures from the Inmarsat buyout. The company will fully realize these benefits in fiscal 2025, contrary to earlier expectations of a three-year window.The company further revealed that despite a mechanical deployment issue on the ViaSat-3 F1 satellite, the payload was fully functional. However, the company expects to recover less than 10% of the planned throughput on ViaSat-3 F1. Nevertheless, management believes that improved flexibility and agility of its integrated satellite fleet, the addition of the next two ViaSat-3 generation satellites, ground network mitigations and third-party bandwidth commitments will enable the company to fulfill the current and future needs of its mobility customers.  In addition, the company projected capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 to decrease year over year in the range of $1.4-$1.5 billion, owing to lower outlays on the ViaSat-3 constellation. As of Sep 30, 2023, Viasat had a liquid balance of $3 billion, including approximately $2.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments with no near-term debt maturities.Viasat’s Satellite Services business is progressing well with key metrics, including ARPU (average revenue per user) and revenues, showing impressive growth. ARPU is growing on the back of a solid retail distribution network, which accounts for a rising proportion of high-value and high-bandwidth subscriber base. Furthermore, the growing adoption of in-flight Wi-Fi services in commercial aircraft is proving conducive to business growth.Viasat’s impressive bandwidth productivity sets it apart from conventional and lower-yield satellite providers that run on incumbent business models. It has a competitive advantage in bandwidth economics, global coverage, flexibility and bandwidth allocation, which makes it believe that mobile broadband will act as a profit churner with a significant improvement in in-flight connectivity (IFC) revenues.The stock has lost 54.2% over the past year compared with the industry fall of 5.4%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchViasat currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Check out some of the best marketing software for small businesses and the top digital marketing agencies in the world.Google Analytics 4: At a GlanceDigital marketing is one of the fastest growing and dynamic industries. This explains why companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) constantly innovate to offer the best solutions. Google Analytics 4 is an analytics tool that allows users to measure traffic and engagement across multiple platforms. On August 2, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) introduced new features to its Google Analytics 4 Platform. The recent upgrade enables users to enhance their campaign performance through a range of new features categorized as; robust audience tools, additional performance-uplifting tools, web-to-app conversion management, and enhanced campaign management for iOS. Among these categories, some tools allow users to reach customers who have not been conventionally targeted through push notifications. According to Alphabet Inc.

Other important additions to the toolset include Google Signals and Gbraids, to name a few. These tools uplift campaign and data performance, while also improving privacy and data protection.Story continuesGoogle Analytics 4 has been under the limelight for a number of reasons, especially related to data privacy and protection. On July 3, TechCrunch reported that the Swedish data protection watchdog fined two firms for using Google Analytics over privacy concerns. The regulator stated that the IP address used by Google Analytics was not enough to ensure data privacy and protection.

45,3b922f63-be21-3c96-b0b7-eb6dd4c5a3a2,MSFT,2023-10-14,"Microsoft spent two years trying to buy Activision Blizzard. For Xbox CEO, that was the easy part",AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-spent-two-years-trying-204550703.html,1697229950,STORY,"['ATVI', 'MSFT']","[After two years co-piloting the biggest acquisition in video game history past an onslaught of challenges, Xbox CEO Phil Spencer now moves on to his next quest: making Microsoft's takeover of Activision Blizzard worth the hassle.Microsoft, which owns the Xbox gaming system, closed its $69 billion deal to buy game-maker Activision Blizzard on Friday after fending off global opposition from antitrust regulators and rivals.It marks a career-defining moment for Spencer, who first joined Microsoft as an intern in 1988 and has helmed Xbox since 2014. After years of lagging behind rival Sony’s PlayStation, acquiring Activision's collection of popular game titles gives Microsoft a rare chance to catch up.“His job really just starts today,” said analyst Gil Luria, technology strategist at D.A. Davidson, after the deal's closure. “All he’s been doing is preparing for today where he actually gets to integrate the business.”And it marks the end of an era for Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, who's led the Southern California maker of Call of Duty and other blockbuster franchises since 1991 after helping to buy it from bankruptcy. Kotick said he's assisting with the transition until the end of the year.Activision Blizzard was still reeling from worker protests, lawsuits and government investigations over allegations of workplace harassment against women and unequal pay when Microsoft privately reached out about buying the company in 2021.When the companies announced a planned merger in January 2022, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made clear it would be ""critical for Activision Blizzard to drive forward” on its commitments to improve its workplace culture.That was just the start of Microsoft's challenges in bringing home the deal. After negotiations with Spencer faltered, top rival Sony brought its concerns about losing access to the Call of Duty franchise to regulators around the world. The strongest opposition came from U.S. antitrust enforcers emboldened by President Joe Biden's administration to take a tougher look at big tech deals, as well as their counterparts in the United Kingdom who finally relented in approving the deal Friday only after Microsoft agreed to make concessions.Story continues“Microsoft didn’t have a choice. If they wanted to be long-term competitive with Sony and the PlayStation platform, they need to have a much more robust content offering,” Luria said.But, “in retrospect, they should have read the writing on the wall in terms of the difficulty of closing the deal,” Luria said. “They needed to do the deal to stay competitive, but knowing what they know now, they might have done it differently.”A key moment came in June, when a federal judge weighed the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's attempt to block the merger while it awaited further review. In an unusual move for a CEO that telegraphed the deal's importance, Spencer spent the better part of two weeks at the defendant table of a San Francisco courtroom conferring with Microsoft’s lawyers. The judge eventually dismissed the FTC's request, though the agency is still seeking to unwind the deal.Microsoft’s success in integrating Activision's business is “not guaranteed, especially as its track record with acquisitions has been a mixed bag,” said George Jijiashvili, senior principal analyst at research and advisory firm Omdia. Last year, Microsoft spent $7.5 billion to acquire ZeniMax Media, the parent company of video game publisher Bethesda Softworks, maker of Elder Scrolls and Fallout.Microsoft's two key game launches this year from its Bethesda merger, Redfall and Starfield, have “been met with mixed reactions at best,” Jijiashvili said. ""However, with globally popular game franchises such as Call of Duty now under its wing, the company is strategically much better positioned.”Another challenge for Microsoft will be overcoming the workforce challenges that dogged Activision before the takeover.As of late last year, Activision Blizzard had 13,000 employees, about 72% in North America, according to a regulatory filing. Microsoft has already pledged it will stay neutral if the nearly 10,000 workers in the U.S. and Canada seek to organize into a labor union, part of a 2022 agreement with the Communications Workers of America meant to address U.S. political concerns about the merger’s effects.“It is a new day for workers at Activision Blizzard,” said CWA President Claude Cummings Jr. in a statement Friday.“Over two years ago, workers at Activision Blizzard’s studios captured the country’s attention through walkouts and other protests over discrimination, sexual harassment, pay inequity, and other issues they were facing on the job,” Cummings Jr. said. “Their efforts to form unions were met with illegal retaliation and attempts to delay and block union elections. Now these workers are free to join our union through a fair process, without interference from management.”In a Friday welcome email to Activision employees, Spencer said he wanted to “reiterate that we hold ourselves to a high bar in delivering the most inclusive and welcoming experiences for players, creators, and employees.”]"

Its shares have fallen almost 40% this year. As the drugstore chain highlighted more cost-cutting measures, along with AI initiatives to make its supply chain more efficient, shares rose 5% in early trading and closed 7% higher on Thursday.Fourth Quarter HighlightsFor the fiscal quarter, Walgreens reported revenue grew roughly 9% to $35.42 billion, topping $34.78 billion LSEG estimated but adjusted earnings amounted to 67 cents, below the expected 69 cents. The Covid-19 transition, leadership turbulence, a wobbly push into healthcare and recent three-day walkouts from its pharmacy staff took a toll as Walgreens missed Wall Street earnings estimates for two consecutive quarters. It has been nearly a decade since Walgreens came short of Wall Street earnings expectations for two quarters in a row. It certainly does not help that Walgreens reported that its U.S. retail sales dropped 4.3% along with a 0.5% decline in total prescriptions that include vaccinations. Walgreens also lost customer share in beauty and personal care due to higher prices that customers were not willing to tolerate, according to GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders.However, interim CEO Ginger Graham finds that this year’s performance has not reflected the strength of Walgreens’ assets, brand legacy and its commitment to our customers and patient.Story continuesOn A More Positive Note...On a brighter note, Walgreens narrowed its net loss to $180 million, or 21 cents per share, down from 2022’s comparable quarter when it lost $415 million, or 48 cents per share.It also reported growth of its health care business, which is now the center of its strategy as Walgreens continues its identity transformation from being a major drugstore chain to a large health-care company. During its fourth fiscal quarter, its U.S. retail pharmacy segment experienced a 3.7% YoY growth as it brought in sales of $27.66 billion. Comparable sales at individual locations rose 5.7%. Pharmacy sales expanded 6.4% YoY with comparable sales rising more than 9% due to price inflation and other impacts. Its international segment experienced a 12% YoY growth as it racked up $5.78 billion in sales with its U.K. subsidiary, Boots, reporting growth of 11%.Progress Has Been Made With Cost Cutting InitiativesThe drugstore chain will be lowering capital expenditures by about $600 million with the impact of these cost reductions expected by early next year. Walgreens stated that it will be trimming its fiscal 2024 costs for at least $1 billion in costs as part of its ongoing efforts, which include shutting unprofitable stores, after the pharmacy chain operator forecasted financial year 2024 profit below Wall Street's expectations.Challenges RemainWalgreens continues to face a steep drop in sales of COVID-19 products along with a weak season of respiratory illnesses, a persistently weak prescription drug demand, pressures from its pharmacy staff and weak demand for its consumer health products due to high inflation. Last financial year was a tough one for Walgreens as it recorded a $6.8 billion pre-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation.A prudent fiscal 2024 year outlook as 2023 challenges are expected to linger.As for the new financial year that ends next August, Walgreens guided for an adjusted profit of $3.20 to $3.50 per share, coming in below LSEG’s estimate of $3.72 per share on the back of annual revenue in the range between $141 billion and $145 billion.Wentwork Has A Tough Job At HandThe former Express Scripts executive brings nearly three decades of healthcare leadership experience to the second-largest U.S. pharmacy chain operator who has pined its hopes on this healthcare industry veteran to reverse its drop in profits and boost its stock price as it navigates through its healthcare transformation.Amazon Might Have Many Years Before Disrupting Healthcare, But Still Poses A Scary ThreatMeanwhile, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) continues to relentlessly pursue healthcare as it works on coordinating its operations in this new segment. For the first ever, four Amazon health chief medical officers spoke together to Yahoo Finance in Las Vegas this week of this new chapter. Amazon was struggling to find its direction for years, but the pandemic was an eureka moment as it showed the tech titan the healthcare problems it can solve. However, Amazon is still years away from becoming a healthcare disruptor, as after all, it did not transform e-commerce overnight either, but this does not mean Walgreens should take its time with its turnaround that also won’t happen overnight.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Moving along these lines, the leading global foodservice distribution company broke ground on a new facility, Sysco Arizona East.The 353,600-square-foot facility requires an investment of $102 million. Management expects to start the unit’s construction by this fall, with operations beginning in the spring of 2025.The Arizona East manufacturing facility will aid the company in fulfilling the demand coming from the growing local market.

The program involves five strategic priorities to enable the company to grow 1.5 times faster than the market by FY24 end. In this regard, the company is enhancing customers’ experience via digital tools and providing customer-oriented merchandising and marketing solutions. Sysco is focused on cultivating new capacities, channels and segments and sponsoring investments via cost-saving initiatives.Sysco Corporation has been undertaking various acquisitions over the years to grow its distribution network and customer base to boost long-term growth. In June 2023, Sysco’s specialty produce business — FreshPoint — took over BIX Produce. The buyout helps FreshPoint strengthen its geographical presence in unexplored areas and enhance its specialty produce offerings. In February 2022, SYY concluded the acquisition of The Coastal Companies, which operates under Sysco’s FreshPoint business.

Although Sysco’s size and scale advantages and strong balance sheet position it for growth in fiscal 2024, the company expects the market to grow at a lower rate than fiscal 2023.

Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Xcel Energy and MGE are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that XEL's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook.

The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$87.21 and falling to the lows of US$72.77. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Archer-Daniels-Midland's current trading price of US$73.32 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Archer-Daniels-Midland’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland What Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Worth?According to my valuation model, Archer-Daniels-Midland seems to be fairly priced at around 5.76% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Archer-Daniels-Midland today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $69.33, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Furthermore, Archer-Daniels-Midland’s low beta implies that the stock is less volatile than the wider market.Can we expect growth from Archer-Daniels-Midland?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for Archer-Daniels-Midland, at least in the near future.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ADM seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ADM for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The stock appears to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystalize your views on ADM should the price fluctuate below its true value.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT) shareholders have seen the share price rise 60% over three years, well in excess of the market return (15%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 2.9% in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Mattel To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Mattel became profitable within the last three years. So we would expect a higher share price over the period.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Mattel has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. Take a more thorough look at Mattel's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.A Different PerspectiveMattel shareholders gained a total return of 2.9% during the year. But that was short of the market average. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 7% per year for five years. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

60,571e6f3a-e4a8-3d81-bb4e-3dec8ff72535,SLB,2023-10-14,Schlumberger (SLB) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-slb-reports-next-week-140010710.html,1697205610,STORY,['SLB'],"[The market expects Schlumberger (SLB) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest oilfield services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.77 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +22.2%.Revenues are expected to be $8.33 billion, up 11.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.51% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Schlumberger?For Schlumberger, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.07%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Schlumberger will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Schlumberger would post earnings of $0.71 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.72, delivering a surprise of +1.41%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Schlumberger doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, Liberty Oilfield Services (LBRT) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.74 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -5.1%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.14 billion, down 4.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Liberty Oilfield Services has been revised 4.5% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.45%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Liberty Oilfield Services will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This company, which is in the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this insurer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 13.81%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, American International Group was expected to post earnings of $1.54 per share, but it reported $1.75 per share instead, representing a surprise of 13.64%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.43 per share, while it actually produced $1.63 per share, a surprise of 13.99%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for American International Group lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.American International Group has an Earnings ESP of +4.02% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on November 1, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain.

The Finance sector has risen 2.2% and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 index has gained 14.6% in the said time frame. With a market capitalization of $4.2 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 1.1 million.Improving mortgage insurance portfolio, declining claims, a well-performing homegenius segment, solid capital position and effective capital deployment continue to drive this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurer.The insurer’s earnings have increased 19% in the past five years, better than the industry average of 5.4%. The expected long-term earnings growth is pegged at 5%. RDN has a solid surprise history, beating earnings estimates in each of the last seven reported quarters.Radian’s return on equity for the trailing 12 months is 17.3%, which compares favorably with the industry’s 10.5%, reflecting the company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWill the Bull Run Continue?Radian’s earnings are poised to grow on the strength of its mortgage insurance portfolio. The primary mortgage insurance in force should benefit from an increase in single premium policy insurance in force and a higher monthly premium policy. Notably, based on a total mortgage origination market of $1.7 trillion, Radian expects the private mortgage insurance market in 2023 to be around $325 billion.Persistency rate is poised to show improvement, given lower refinance activity, due to an increase in mortgage interest rates. Its business restructuring moves are focused on the core business and services with higher growth potential, ensuring a predictable and recurring fee-based revenue streamRDN has been witnessing declining claims over the past few years. Given the strong credit characteristics of the new loans insured, we expect the company to witness a lesser number of claims, favoring profitability.However, Radian’s homegenius title and real estate businesses are affected by a decrease in industry-wide mortgage and real estate transaction volume, inflationary pressures and a higher interest rate environment. Nonetheless, with the continuing focus on disciplined cost management, Radian remains hopeful about managing the homegenius business through this challenging environment.Banking on operational excellence, this mortgage insurer maintains a solid balance sheet with sufficient liquidity and strong cash flows.Solid liquidity favors effective capital deployment. RDN has increased dividends for four straight years and boasts the highest dividend yield in the private MI industry. Its current dividend yield of 3.5% is better than the industry average of 2.7%. RDN has $280 million remaining under its buyback authorization.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome top-ranked stocks from the multi-line insurance industry are Old Republic International Corporation ORI, Everest Group, Ltd.

Regarding the top line, our $8.5 billion consensus revenue estimate has primarily remained unchanged.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOf course, subscribers are the key metric for NFLX and will be what many focus on. For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Net Subscriber Adds stands at 5.8 million, well above the year-ago figure of 2.4 million. It’s worth noting that the company crushed our consensus estimate regarding the metric in its latest release by more than 250%.TeslaTesla saw negative coverage following the release of its Q3 EV production and deliveries results despite warning investors of a planned factory shutdown in the prior earnings call. TSLA will report on Wednesday, October 18th.Nonetheless, the EV leader produced over 430,000 vehicles and delivered roughly 435,000 throughout Q3, reflecting a sequential decline.

Wolfe Research Analyst Peter Supino cited concerns with the streaming giant's 2024 growth forecast, given the slow adoption of its new ad tier among other issues. Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down the downgrade and overall outlook for the streaming service landscape amid the ongoing Hollywood actors' strike.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Netflix is getting hit with a downgrade this morning, after Wolfe Research slashed its rating on the stock, saying the risk reward for the streaming giant is, quote, ""balanced."" So what does the signal ahead of a key earnings report for Netflix? Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal on top of that for us. Allie, steep loss today, at least, more than 2%.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes, and you normally don't see these downgrades for Netflix. But we did see that this morning from Wolfe Research. As you mentioned, downgrading shares to peer perform from outperform. And the analysts also removed his price target on shares, which were previously one of the highest on the streets at $500 a share of analyst Peter Supino said his biggest concern revolves around Netflix's growth forecast for 2024, given slow adoption of the ad tier, along with the recent shortfalls around average revenue per user, which is a key metric when you measure profitability.Now management has also warned that over the near term, there's going to be less margin expansion. That was a big disappointment to investors. So there are quite a few risks out there that seem to cloud the longer term outlook for this company. And when you think about the landscape around streaming, there's a hefty amount of competition. Netflix will likely raise prices. It has already eliminated that middle $9.99 subscription tier.So that makes a discrepancy between the ad supported tier and the ad free tier more prominent. And that means less choice, ultimately, for consumers. So considering the current valuation of this company, the streamer really needs to make sure it's keeping up with its content cycle. It's upping that engagement. It's driving those new subscribers so that those rewards can ultimately balance out the risk of growth expectation reductions.Story continuesAnd if we take a look at shares, like you said, they're down about 2%. We're up 20% on the year, but down 20% over the past three months. So investors have been a bit more cautious. And that means next week's earnings will be, especially, important with all eyes on those margin figures that are due along with any new details surrounding the impact of the password sharing crackdown along with the ad supported tier.I think we're just hitting a point where investors want specifics. And although Netflix has repeatedly said that these revenue initiatives are longer term initiatives, there just needs to be a little more specificity when it comes to the upside here.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, now that we've got the WGA strike over, obviously, SAG-AFTRA is still having to negotiate their contract. What are you hearing from analysts about the impact that they have seen on a company like Netflix?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, I think that's critical for Netflix. They are a company that relies on their content. At the end of the day, content is king. And the longer this actor strike goes on, the more that's going to affect these various studios. So hoping for a quick resolution. We'll see if that can get done. We're at this critical moment in the fall. And we only have a few more months before the end of the year.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, we'll be listening for any commentary on that front, as well, when Netflix reports next week. Allie Canal, Thanks so much.]"

DLTR revealed plans to recruit thousands of full and part-time associates for the upcoming holiday season through a Nationwide Hiring Event on Oct 18. The company will hire sales associates, customer service representatives, stockers, assistant store managers and store managers.Hired employees will be offered competitive pay, a comprehensive reward package and flexible schedules. Associates will also gain from DailyPay — a voluntary benefit, wherein they can receive their earnings between traditional paydays.Moving on, the company has an education assistance program called ValuED, which provides financial support and a wide range of development opportunities for upskilling. As part of this, full-time associates will be eligible for tuition discounts, and reimbursement allowances for college degrees, GED programs and language courses.Several other retailers have kicked off their hiring session for the holiday season through seasonal recruits that will improve customer shopping experiences. Retailers are increasingly focused on strengthening supply chains to avoid disruptions, which have been deterrents for a while.Macy’s M announced plans to recruit 38,000 associates ahead of the holiday shopping season. The new employees will be posted at Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, as well as its supply-chain locations and call centers.This reflects a decline from last year when Macy’s hired 41,000 seasonal associates for the 2022 holiday season. M also noted that seasonal workers have the opportunity for seasonal workers to transition into permanent roles.Target TGT unveiled its hiring plan for the current holiday season. TGT is likely to recruit 100,000 associates for full and part-time positions from Sep 20.Vacancies are available in all departments, including guest advocates, front-of-store attendants, fulfillment experts, general merchandising experts, food and beverage experts, and style consultants. Target’s hiring numbers remained the same as the 2022 holiday sale.Amazon AMZN announced its hiring plan for the current holiday season. AMZN is likely to recruit 250,000 associates for full and part-time, and seasonal positions in a bid to expand its next-day delivery service.This indicates an increase from last year's holiday season’s 150,000 positions, driven by its newly added 50 fulfillment centers. However, the company noted that it would hire fewer people in stores and warehouses this year due to reduced consumer spending in 2023.Coming back to DLTR, the company has been optimizing its store portfolio through store openings, renovations, re-banners and closings. Its Key Real Estate Initiatives, which include the expansion of its $3 and $5 plus assortment in Dollar Tree stores, as well as Combo Stores, bode well.The company has been aggressively expanding its $3, $4 and $5 frozen and refrigerated products across the Dollar Tree store base. It continues to expect to have at least 5,000 Dollar Tree Plus! Stores by the end of 2024. Its growth optimization and productivity improvement projects will include 650 new stores, an estimated 1,000 store renovations, numerous distribution center projects and technology projects to enhance its efficiencies and support growth.Dollar Tree has been gaining from growth across both segments, higher traffic and robust market share gains. This led to year-over-year sales growth of 8.2% to $7,325 million in second-quarter fiscal 2023. Enterprise same-store sales (comps) improved 6.9% year over year.Consequently, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) raised its fiscal 2023 top-line view. For fiscal 2023, Dollar Tree expects consolidated net sales of $30.6-$30.9 billion, up from the prior mentioned $30-$30.5 billion. We estimate sales to be $30.1 billion. The company anticipates mid-single-digit comps growth compared with the earlier mentioned low to mid-single-digit growth and our estimate of 4.4% growth.Comps are likely to grow in the mid-single digits in the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments. Previously, it expected low to mid-single-digit growth at Dollar Tree and a mid-single-digit increase in the Family Dollar segment.For third-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects consolidated net sales of $7.3-$7.5 billion based on mid-single-digit comps growth for the enterprise. We estimate net sales of $7.3 million and comps growth of 3.7%. Comp sales are also expected to improve in the mid-single digits at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.However, Dollar Tree is reeling under inflationary costs, and witnessed a lower initial mark-on, an unfavorable sales mix and shrink, and wage investments in distribution center payroll, which affected margins. The metric contracted 220 basis points (bps) to 29.2%. We had estimated a 140-bps contraction in the gross margin. The gross margin contracted 400 bps to 33.4% at the Dollar Tree banner and 30 bps to 24.4% at the Family Dollar segment. Also, the operating margin declined 360 bps to 3.9% compared with our estimate of a 350-bps contraction.The company has been witnessing higher SG&amp;A expenses, owing to elevated payroll, increased repair and maintenance expenses, and store facility costs. In second-quarter fiscal 2023, Dollar Tree’s SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 130 bps to 25.3% compared with our estimate of 200 bps expansion.Going ahead, the company expects a challenging macro environment to continue hurting its sales mix in both segments. Also, margin pressure is expected to persist through the back half of the year.For fiscal 2023, management expects earnings per share (EPS) of $5.78-$6.08 (including a 12-cent contribution from the 53rd week and a 12-cent charge for the legal reserve) compared with the prior mentioned $5.73-$6.13 for fiscal 2023. The view is in sync with our estimate of $5.92. For third-quarter fiscal 2023, EPS is estimated to be 94 cents to $1.04 compared with our estimate of $1.18.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research We note that DLTR shares have plunged 27.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 3.7%.

The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Valued at $10.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2024. The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Huntington Beach, CA.What’s Supporting Boeing?For 100 years, Boeing has been leading unmanned technology innovation and integration from sea to air to space.Boeing’s Echo Voyager is a fully autonomous XLUUV-class Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (“UUV”) that can be used for various missions, which were previously impossible due to traditional UUV limitations. The vehicle’s advanced autonomy enables it to perform at sea for months at a time, delivering a more affordable, mission-capable solution over traditional UUVs.Prior to Echo Voyager, Boeing developed Echo Seeker and Echo Ranger, autonomous and large UUVs as test beds for its current XLUUV.The aforementioned discussion reflects the proven expertise of BA in the UUV space. This is likely to have led to a steady inflow of contracts for the company, like the latest one. This, in turn, should bolster its revenue generation prospects from the UUV product line.Growth ProspectsThe recent tiff between Ukraine and Russia has led other nations to strengthen their defense landscape to deter any war-like situation. UUVs are noted for their ability to carry out dangerous maritime operations, such as mine countermeasure missions and harbor patrol. Therefore, as investments in undersea warfare capabilities have increased manifold, so has the demand for state-of-the-art UUVs. Long-endurance, autonomous maritime vehicles offer new ways to gather data and conduct missions in the ocean and communicate across domains to deliver actionable intelligence.With technological advancements, nations are more rapidly adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to increase the autonomy of UUVs. As a result, hefty investments in developing and acquiring autonomous marine systems can be expected in the coming days, thereby boosting the UUV market.

The Kuwaiti government has announced aims to become a major OPEC producer by massively boosting production in the coming years. This is supported by large investments in the sector and the expansion of its upstream and downstream sectors. As many other countries embrace a green transition, Kuwait hopes to be a major international player in the oil and gas market so long as demand for the fossil fuels remains.Kuwait, one of the OPEC’s top producers, plans to increase its oil output to 3.15 million bpd within the next four years, from 2.7 million bpd at present. The Middle East state also hopes to increase its natural gas production by 70 percent over the same period. Kuwait currently follows Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Iran as OPEC’s fifth-largest producer. In recent months, Kuwait has adhered to OPEC+ production cuts, reducing its output by 128,000 bpd. Meanwhile, Iran, which is exempt from the cuts, has increased its crude output, allowing it to surpass Kuwait. Kuwait’s production quota for the next year currently stands at 2.676 million bpd. OPEC’s restriction of oil quotas is aimed at stabilising the market, which has become extremely volatile in recent years.Despite short-term cuts, Kuwait hopes to significantly boost its oil output over the next decade to meet the ongoing demand for the fossil fuel. This sentiment has been echoed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which both intend to increase their output by 1 million bpd each within the next few years. Kuwait has around 100 billion barrels of oil reserves, according to estimates, putting it in a good position to exploit its resources before demand begins to wane in line with a global green transition.Kuwait’s plan to boost oil and gas production is already gaining traction with the country’s Oil Minister, Saad Al Barrak, announcing a new strategy to increase output through the development of the Durra gas field in partnership with Saudi Arabia. This aligns with the government-backed Kuwait Petroleum Corporation’s (KPC) 2040 strategy. KPC hopes to increase its oil production capacity to as much as 4 million bpd by 2035, with an investment of $410 billion across its operations.Story continuesThe KPC subsidiary Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) plans to increase oil production to 3.65 million bpd by 2035, which could mean revenues of almost $11 billion over the five years following. KOC is accountable for around 90 percent of Kuwait’s oil production. The company also has big plans for its gas sector, expecting to reach a daily gas production capacity of 1.5 trillion cubic feet by 2040.KOC has awarded several oil and gas contracts this year, valued at $3.25 billion. Between January and August, KOC awarded 91 projects, according to local media sources. This marks a significant increase in the number of contracts signed in recent years, following the Covid-19-related decline over the last three years. This follows recent successes for KPC, which posted a decade-high net profit of $8.48 billion for the 2023-2023 financial year.The Durra field, which Iran also claims a stake in, is estimated to have around 20 trillion cubic feet in proven reserves and is expected to be operational by 2029. Al Barrak said the offshore Durra gas field “is considered one of the most important axes of the government's work program”. Kuwait signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia in 2022 to develop the field. In July, Al Barrak stated that the deal gives the two countries exclusive rights in Durra, requesting that Iran validate its claim to the field by demarcating its own maritime borders.In addition to boosting production levels, Kuwait also has big plans for its downstream sector. It hopes to increase its refining capacity to 1.6 million bpd locally and 425,000 bpd abroad by 2025. The Kuwait Integrated Petroleum Industries Company's (KIPIC) Al Zour refinery complex in the south of the country is expected to come online this month. The company’s CEO, Waleed Al Bader, stated “We will witness the operation of the third refinery in the next few days, so it reaches a maximum capacity of 615,000 barrels a day.”KPC's international arm Kuwait Petroleum International also expects its full commercial operation of Oman's Duqum refinery to come online by the end of the year. Meanwhile, another subsidiary of KPC, the Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (KUFPEC), said that it is in serious discussions to acquire the biggest gas field in Asia, though it has not provided further details.A wide variety of new oil and gas projects is expected to help Kuwait become an even bigger OPEC producer over the next decade. The government is investing heavily in the future of its oil and gas industry, as many neighbouring countries invest in the diversification of their energy sectors in line with a global green transition. While many world powers expect global oil and gas demand to eventually wane, Kuwait is betting on the longevity of the industry, reflected in its high production targets for the coming decades.By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Brent Nears $90 As The U.S. Signals Stricter Sanctions EnforcementTreasury Targets Firms Ignoring $60 Cap On Russian CrudeIs A Steel Slump On The Horizon?Read this article on OilPrice.com]"

Russia is still waging war against Ukraine, the Middle East has seen a war breakout between Israel and Hamas, and strains between the US and China remain elevated.The new record high also comes as oil prices have also jumped in recent months, with Brent crude up 24% since June. That's as top OPEC+ producers Saudi Arabia and Russia have curbed supplies.What's perhaps most impressive about the steady surge in oil production is the fact that the weekly US oil rig count remains well below the 2014 peak of more than 1,600 rigs. There were just 502 active oil rigs in the US last week, representing a 69% decline from the 2014 peak. That shows just how efficient America's energy industry has become after a period of depressed oil prices from 2014 through 2021.""Crude production is cyclical, but over the last decade and a half has registered a strong uptrend relative to operating rigs or employment in the oil and gas industry. This is a powerful form of technological progress and productivity growth,"" Comerica Bank chief economist Bill Adams told Insider on Thursday.There are plenty of economic benefits to America as it consistently becomes a net exporter of crude oil. Adams highlighted that it makes America's economy more resilient and reduces the chance of a recession in 2024.It also reduces the risk of 1970s-style stagflation, which was in part driven by oil supply shocks.Story continues""Unlike in the 1970s, the US is a net exporter of petroleum products. That means that the trade deficit now tends to narrow as petroleum prices rise, supporting the value of the US dollar and reducing prices of imports and related inflation pressures,"" Adams said.""Rising energy output will be a tailwind to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2023, and will contribute to lower risk of a US recession in 2024.""Read the original article on Business Insider]"

The further above 0, the more stretched supply chains are. Index &lt; 0, supply chain capacity is being underutilized. The further below 0, the more underutilized supply chains are.Notably, Europe was the principal driver of September's sharper rise in idle vendor capacity, with suppliers to the continent registering one of the highest levels of spare capacity since the global financial crisis between 2008 and 2009 amid considerable weakness in demand, thereby signalling elevated recession risks.In stark contrast, excess supplier capacity within North America rose by its smallest margin since April, signalling increased odds of a soft landing for the U.S. economy. Although demand remains under pressure, the decline is slowing, and some companies are reporting price increases from their vendors.Asian suppliers, after displaying relatively greater resilience in the year-to-date, reported greater spare capacity for the first time since July, reflecting a slump in purchasing activity. This suggests manufacturers in the region are preparing for lower production schedules.Commenting on the September data, Jagadish Turimella, chief operating officer and co-founder, GEP, explained: ""We're now into our sixth consecutive month of notable excess supplier capacity globally, but the good news is it's not getting substantially worse, except in Europe, where recession seems likely. By contrast, we expect U.S. suppliers and businesses to be steady for the rest of the year, unless the labor disputes in health care and the auto sector spread, or there is a price spike in oil, its derivates or agricultural commodities.""Story continuesSEPTEMBER 2023 KEY FINDINGS DEMAND: While the downturn in demand for raw materials, commodities and components appears to be stabilizing, the pace of decline is showing no real signs of slowing as purchasing activity fell again at a similar rate to those seen in the summer months.INVENTORIES: Global businesses continue to shy away from stockpiling, indicating a generally pessimistic outlook for demand.MATERIAL SHORTAGES: Supply shortages have ended, with reports of item scarcity now in line with historically normal levels.LABOR SHORTAGES: Labor shortages remain generally unproblematic for global businesses. Some of the issues manufacturers in Europe and North America experienced with respect to staff availability in August receded in September.TRANSPORTATION: Global transportation costs fell in September following August's renewed rise, albeit only slightly.REGIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN VOLATILITYNORTH AMERICA: Index rose to -0.30, from -0.55, its highest since April, hinting at greater odds of a soft landing for the U.S. economy.EUROPE: Sharp fall in the index to -1.01, from -0.50, putting it at levels seen during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. Europe was the principal driver of excess supplier capacity globally in September. U.K.: Suppliers to the U.K. continue to see substantial rises in spare capacity. Index fell to -0.98 from -0.92.ASIA: Index drops to -0.20, from 0.06, highlighting deteriorating economic conditions in the East after a relatively resilient year-to-date.For more information, visit www.gep.com/volatilityNote: Full historical data dating back to January 2005 is available for subscription.

The headline figure is a weighted sum of six sub-indices derived from PMI data, PMI Comments Trackers and PMI Commodity Price &amp; Supply Indicators compiled by S&amp;P Global.A value above 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being stretched and supply chain volatility is increasing. The further above 0, the greater the extent to which capacity is being stretched.A value below 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being underutilized, reducing supply chain volatility. The further below 0, the greater the extent to which capacity is being underutilized.A Supply Chain Volatility Index is also published at a regional level for Europe, Asia, North America and the U.K. For more information about the methodology, click here.About GEPGEP® delivers AI-powered procurement and supply chain solutions that help global enterprises become more agile and resilient, operate more efficiently and effectively, gain competitive advantage, boost profitability and increase shareholder value.Fresh thinking, innovative products, unrivaled domain expertise, smart, passionate people — this is how GEP SOFTWARE™, GEP STRATEGY™ and GEP MANAGED SERVICES™ together deliver procurement and supply chain solutions of unprecedented scale, power and effectiveness.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.Synchrony Financial (SYF) is a stock many investors are watching right now. SYF is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 5.65 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 11.18. Over the last 12 months, SYF's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.56 and as low as 5.36, with a median of 6.48.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. SYF has a P/S ratio of 0.65. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.45.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Synchrony Financial's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now.

Goldman Sachs Says These 2 ‘Blue Chip’ Stocks Are Less Vulnerable to Rising Rates,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seeking-stability-goldman-sachs-says-190931972.html,1697224171,STORY,"['GS', 'V', 'MA']","[Policies can have a ripple effect, often going beyond their initial intent. We’re seeing this now from the Federal Reserve, which has made it clear that, in response to stubbornly persistent inflation, it will be holding interest rates higher for longer.This trend aligns with observations made by David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs. Kostin points out that stocks have shown a strong return on equity (ROE) over the past several decades, reflecting a positive combination of profitability and efficiency. However, these prosperous times may be coming to an end as higher interest rates start impacting corporate activities.“If rates continue to rise or stay higher for longer,” Kostin states in his recent note, “increased borrowing costs would disincentivize companies from taking on greater amounts of leverage.”To guide investors, Kostin has listed a range of stocks that he believes are “less vulnerable to rising rates and offer stability amid greater macro uncertainty.” Prominent among his picks are credit card issuers and processors. These companies have been benefiting from strong consumer spending in recent years, and the industry giants among them possess the deep resources necessary to weather the impact of rising interest rates. Let’s take a closer look at two of these ‘blue chip’ names.Mastercard (MA)We’ll start with Mastercard, one of the market’s true ‘blue chip’ stocks. With a market cap of $374 billion, Mastercard is currently the third-largest of the major credit card issuer/processor companies (Visa and JPMorgan Chase hold the first and second spots, respectively) and has been an industry leader since its founding in 1966.The company has over 3,900 clients in more than 120 countries and handles more than 125 billion purchase transactions annually at more than 80 million merchant locations.Mastercard will report its 3Q23 results late this month – but a look at the Q2 results is informative. In Q2, Mastercard showed several solid metrics, starting with the gross dollar volume of $2.3 trillion, up 12% year-over-year. Cross-border transaction volumes were up 24%, and the company’s adjusted net revenue came to $6.3 billion, up 14% from the $5.5 billion in 2Q22, and beating the forecast by $130 million. The company’s bottom line, reported as a non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS of $2.89, was 6 cents ahead of the expectations.Story continuesAmong the bulls is Goldman Sachs analyst Will Nance, who sees future growth potential as the key story.“We continue to see strong tailwinds for MA over the next several years, especially given its greater leverage to the emerging markets, where card penetration is lower, as well as the company’s strategic focus on value added services. With shares currently trading at 27x 2024E P/E, shares are trading roughly in-line with history, and appear cheap relative to the market (even excluding FAAMG). We believe the company’s superior growth profile screens as attractive and would lean into any further weakness over the next few months,” Nance opined.Looking ahead, Nance rates MA stock a Buy, and his $456 price target implies a one-year upside potential of ~15%. (To watch Nance’s track record, click here)Overall, big-name stocks like Mastercard never lack for Wall Street attention, and there are 20 recent reviews of MA shares with a breakdown of 19 to 1 favoring Buy over Hold for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is currently priced at $397.67 and its average price target of $462.72 is slightly more bullish than the Goldman view, suggesting ~16% gain in the next 12 months. (See Mastercard stock forecast)Visa Inc. (V)Next up is Visa, the world’s largest credit card issuer with a market cap approaching $493 billion and more than 4.2 billion branded VISA cards in use, issued by more than 15,000 financial institutions.Visa handled approximately 269 billion payment transactions in the 12 months that ended this past June 30, conducted through more than 100 million merchant locations in 200 countries globally. There are not many companies that operate on this scale, in any niche.Visa saw strong performance in the last reported quarter of the company’s fiscal year 2023, which ended in June. The quarter showed a top-line net revenue of $8.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year, and came in $40 million ahead of the estimates. The company’s non-GAAP net income was $4.5 billion, or $2.16 per share; that EPS figure was 4 cents per share better than had been expected.The company has seen a strong annualized increase in its payments volume of 9%, driven by its ‘cross-border transactions excluding intra-Europe,’ which were up 22%. Total processed transactions were 10% year-over-year.Checking in again with Will Nance, we find that the Goldman Sachs analyst is sanguine on Visa’s potential going forward. He writes of the company, “Overall, trends in the business continue to be relatively stable and the company sees significant runway remaining for the core consumer payments business, while making progress with new flows (~10x larger opportunity than consumer payments)… We view the space as attractive, with macro sentiment improving and with valuations at relative lows.”Nance quantifies his bullish stance with a Buy rating on V, while his $286 price target indicates his confidence in a 21% upside on the one-year horizon. (To watch Nance’s track record, click here)Overall, Visa has picked up 24 reviews recently from the Street’s analysts, and these include 20 Buys and 4 Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock’s average target price of $281.91 implies a one-year gain of ~19% from the current share price of $236.96.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MA.As of 2023-10-13, Mastercard Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $265.41. It's currently trading at a price of $399.9. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -50.67%. The company is modestly overvalued.The Art of Valuation: Discovering Mastercard Inc's Intrinsic ValueThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Mastercard Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$10.67GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.62%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 16.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=141.27Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=124.14Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=265.41Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $261.61. This valuation indicates that the Mastercard Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -52.86%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 74% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of QUALCOMM, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About QUALCOMM?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in QUALCOMM. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at QUALCOMM's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. QUALCOMM is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.9%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.6% and 4.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of QUALCOMMWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of QUALCOMM Incorporated. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$85m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 26% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that  QUALCOMM is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Ultimately the future is most important.

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 31.8% loss over the past four weeks.Viasat has offered an update of key operational metrics and reiterated its guidance for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. With the realization of synergistic benefits from the successful integration of Inmarsat over the next fiscal, the company expects to reach the inflection point of sustainable positive free cash flow in the first half of 2025, rather than the second half as anticipated earlier.In fiscal 2025, Viasat expects to record synergies to the tune of $80 million in annual operating expenses and around $110 million in annual capital expenditures from the Inmarsat buyout. The company will fully realize these benefits in FY25, contrary to earlier expectations of a three-year window for the same. Such positive feelers seemed to have hit the right investor chords and propelled the stock higher.This provider of satellite and wireless networking technology is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +144.3%. Revenues are expected to be $1.07 billion, up 63.4% from the year-ago quarter.While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For ViaSat, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions.

The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Valued at $10.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2024. The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Huntington Beach, CA.What’s Supporting Boeing?For 100 years, Boeing has been leading unmanned technology innovation and integration from sea to air to space.Boeing’s Echo Voyager is a fully autonomous XLUUV-class Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (“UUV”) that can be used for various missions, which were previously impossible due to traditional UUV limitations. The vehicle’s advanced autonomy enables it to perform at sea for months at a time, delivering a more affordable, mission-capable solution over traditional UUVs.Prior to Echo Voyager, Boeing developed Echo Seeker and Echo Ranger, autonomous and large UUVs as test beds for its current XLUUV.The aforementioned discussion reflects the proven expertise of BA in the UUV space. This is likely to have led to a steady inflow of contracts for the company, like the latest one. This, in turn, should bolster its revenue generation prospects from the UUV product line.Growth ProspectsThe recent tiff between Ukraine and Russia has led other nations to strengthen their defense landscape to deter any war-like situation. UUVs are noted for their ability to carry out dangerous maritime operations, such as mine countermeasure missions and harbor patrol. Therefore, as investments in undersea warfare capabilities have increased manifold, so has the demand for state-of-the-art UUVs. Long-endurance, autonomous maritime vehicles offer new ways to gather data and conduct missions in the ocean and communicate across domains to deliver actionable intelligence.With technological advancements, nations are more rapidly adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to increase the autonomy of UUVs. As a result, hefty investments in developing and acquiring autonomous marine systems can be expected in the coming days, thereby boosting the UUV market. To this end, the Fortune Business Insights firm projects the global unmanned underwater vehicle market to witness a CAGR of 13.5% during the 2023-2030 period.Story continuesSuch growth trends should boost Huntington Ingalls along with other defense primes like Huntington Ingalls HII, General Dynamics GD and Lockheed Martin LMT, which have a strong presence in the unmanned underwater vehicle market.Serving customers in more than 30 countries, Huntington Ingalls provides design, autonomy, manufacturing, testing, operations and sustainment of unmanned systems, including UUVs and unmanned surface vessels. Its REMUS family of UUVs consists of low logistics UUVs that can be rapidly deployed from any vessel of opportunity, with their common usage in mine countermeasures, search and recovery and antisubmarine warfare.Huntington Ingalls’ long-term earnings growth rate is 6.6%. The Zacks consensus estimate for HII’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 3.5% from the 2022 reported figure.General Dynamics’ Bluefin SandShark is a one-person-portable, low-cost, autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle designed to leverage today’s miniaturized sensors and emerge as the development platform for the next generation.General Dynamics boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.2%.

You can skip our detailed analysis on how countries are racking up their defense capabilities amid military escalation in Ukraine and its impact on the armaments industry by heading over to the 10 Strongest Armies in the World in 2023.Plenty has unfolded in the last three years. Azerbaijan has seized parts of the Nagorno-Karabakh region from Armenia, Afghanistan has fallen to the Taliban, there are regular border skirmishes between China and India, Russia’s war in Ukraine is nearing 600 days of conflict, and if that was not it, the Middle East has gone up in flames once more with already thousands killed after Palestinian group Hamas’ attack on Israel, which was followed by Tel Aviv ordering aerial strikes on the Gaza strip.These events have forced several countries, especially those in Europe, to increase their defense spendings to bolster national security. According to figures shared by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), global defense spending was estimated to be $2.2 trillion in 2022, with Europe having its steepest rise in 30 years. The United States, China, and Russia account for more than half of all global spending. NATO countries’ defense expenditure was up 0.9% in 2022 year on year, to total $1.2 trillion last year.The surge in spending has created a boom for armament manufacturers. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) generated $66 billion in revenues and net earnings of $5.7 billion in 2022. It is the largest federal defense contractor in the United States, having received over 11% of all DoD spending in 2022, including a $950 million missile order from the Pentagon to refill stockpiles in Ukraine. A number of countries are also equipping their air force with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 fifth-generation fighter jet. You can read more on this in our article, Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023.Story continuesThis year, the company’s financial performance is even better, as noted by Chairman and CEO, Jim Taiclet, in Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s Q2 2023 Earnings Call:Our Q2 financial results were strong, with sales of $16.7 billion up 8% year-over-year and double-digit growth at both aeronautics and space. Backlog reached a record level of $158 billion, up $8 billion from year-end resulting from a book-to-bill of $1.7 in the quarter. Orders included an approximately $8 billion option of [Indiscernible] for the 126 F-35 for production lot 17 as well as significant awards to ramp up emissions [Ph] at MSC.This highest ever backlog gives us visibility into multi-year sales of our key programs and enables our suppliers to be better positioned to meet growing demand. Segment operating profit of $1.9 million in the quarter reflected an operating margin of 11.1%. Free cash flow was $771 million and we remain committed to advancing technology and expanding production capacity. So in Q2, we invested $356 million of company funded R&amp;D and $329 million of capital expenditures to address our customer’s needs and requirements. Meanwhile, we returned almost two times free cash flow to the shareholders. Given the strong results in the first half of this year, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2023 financial outlook. For sales we’re raising the midpoint of our range by $1 billion to revise expectations of between $66.25 billion to $66.75 billion and free EPS we are raising the midpoint of our range by $0.35, to revise the expectation of between $27 to $27.20 per share.Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX)’s net earnings rose 8.9% from 2021 to total $14.1 billion in 2022. The armament manufacturer won 6.1% of all defense-related contracts from the DoD during the year, including an order worth nearly $1 billion from the U.S. Air Force to develop scramjet-powered hypersonic cruise missiles.Revenues of Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) were also significantly higher in 2022 compared to the previous year. The company is known for its expertise in space and command and control systems. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is also the manufacturer of the strategic bomber B-21 Raider, which is currently under development for use by the U.S. Air Force.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:Our other purchase was Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), a US defense contractor whose stock price experienced a pullback. We like that Northrop has a larger presence than its rivals in the most favorable subcategories of the defense industry-namely, nuclear weapons, space systems, and what’s known as C4ISR (which stands for Command, Control, Communications, Computers. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance). C4ISR refers to digital systems that translate data picked up from different sensors-such as an incoming hypersonic missile or advancing troops-into a common format, and then escalate key information to the right people These differentiated technologies are especially relevant in a time of increased geopolitical tensions. Northrop also benefits from large barriers to entry in this stable industry, which should enable continued strong earnings and cash flow.All being said, recent conflicts have also demonstrated how having large armored, artillery, and infantry units are not enough to gauge a military’s strength. Having an experienced and battle-hardened force, technological advancement in military hardware, and a strong and stable economy are just as important determinants that are often overlooked. Russia, for instance, has the highest number of nuclear weapons, tanks, rocket artillery (MLRS), and self-propelled artillery in the world, and ranks third when it comes to armored fighting vehicles. Despite being a force on paper, it has struggled to find its way in Ukraine in a war that has stretched nearly 600 days with no end in sight.MethodologyWe have ranked the 25 strongest armies in the world by analyzing key metrics pertaining to strength of ground forces, such as active manpower, tanks fleet, armored fighting vehicles, rocket projectors, attack helicopters and nuclear weapons. Collectively, these metrics have been assigned a weight of 50% to determine our rankings. 30% is made up of countries’ military technological capabilities, which is a product of the technological advancement levels of a country coupled with its defense spending. Lastly, we have also considered the sizes of the economies and assigned GDP a 20% weightage. This is a key metric because only a strong economy would be able to sustain a capable ground force over the long run.Data has been sourced from the Global Firepower Index 2023 and our recent articles, 25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023, 50 Largest Economies in the World Ranked by PPP and 25 Most Technologically Advanced Countries in the World in 2022.25 Strongest Armies in the World in 2023Photo by Joel Rivera-Camacho on UnsplashLet’s now head over to the list of the strongest armies in the world in 2023.25.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Lockheed Martin (LMT) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $6.67 a share, just four days from its upcoming earnings release on October 17, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $6.67 Most Accurate Estimate and the $6.66 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Lockheed Martin has an Earnings ESP of 0.15%.LMT is one of just a large database of Aerospace stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is RTX (RTX).Slated to report earnings on October 24, 2023, RTX holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.19 a share 11 days from its next quarterly update.For RTX, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 is 0.2%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, LMT and RTX could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Smith",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-bank-110900672.html,1697195340,STORY,"['LMT', 'RPM', 'AOS', 'MCD', 'OZK']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 13, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Bank OZK OZK, McDonald's Corp. MCD, RPM International Inc. RPM, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT and A. O. Smith Corp. AOS.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Stocks in Focus on Their Recent Dividend HikeWall Street started October with a volatile trading pattern like the last two months. The Fed kept the benchmark lending rate unchanged at the existing 5.25-5.5% range at its September FOMC meeting. Market participants were widely expecting a status quo. However, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell created uncertainty among investors.Although the Fed paused its rate hike in the September FOMC meeting, the current dot plot has shown a strong likelihood of one more hike of 25 basis points in 2023. That will take the terminal interest rate of this hiking cycle to 5.6%, well above the 5.1% forecast in June. Notably, the current range of the Fed fund rate is the highest level since March 2001.More importantly, the central bank said it would keep interest rates higher for a longer time. The new projection has shown two rate cuts in 2024 instead of four projected in June. The first cut in interest rate is not expected before September 2024.Moreover, the unresolved war between Russia and Ukraine and the recent geopolitical conflict between Israel and the Palestine-based terrorist group Hamas may inject more volatility in the near future.Stocks to WatchAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolios. We believe one should consider stocks that have recently raised their dividend payments.Five such companies are — Bank OZK, McDonald's Corp., RPM International Inc.,Lockheed Martin Corp. and A. O. Smith Corp.. Each of these stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesBank OZK provides various retail and commercial banking services. OZK accepts different deposit products, including non-interest-bearing checking, interest-bearing transactions, business sweep, savings, money market, individual retirement, and other accounts, and time deposits. OZK is expected to benefit from branch consolidation efforts and robust loan balances along with strengthening non-interest income.On Oct 2, 2023, Bank OZK declared that its shareholders would receive a dividend of $0.37 per share on Oct 20, 2023. It has a dividend yield of 4.2%. Over the past five years, OZK has increased its dividend 20 times, and its payout ratio presently stays at 26% of earnings.

103,6ae1101c-ee0c-3ce8-b723-0f19d6c733c3,JNJ,2023-10-14,How big companies from EY to Johnson & Johnson are learning to master AI prompts,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-companies-ey-johnson-johnson-190204973.html,1697223724,STORY,['JNJ'],"[The race among companies to adapt AI has evolved: Instead of simply striving to be first, firms have turned their attention to learning how to deploy these powerful tools effectively. This development comes as companies discover that poorly crafted prompts—the set of instructions used to tell AI to perform a given task—and the use of unspecialized models are spawning inaccuracies and inefficiencies.There are many examples of this evolution. Firms like Johnson &amp; Johnson are creating libraries of prompts to share among staff to improve the quality of AI output. Other companies, including Starbucks, are taking things further by creating in-house models.For context, it’s helpful to know that using a so-called large language model, like ChatGPT, requires entering a prompt for the AI that can be as simple as ""summarize this story.""""There are two parts of prompting. One part is just to give a good description of what you want done,"" Christopher Manning, professor of computer science and linguistics at Stanford University and director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, told Fortune. ""After that, there's a lot of fiddling that goes on because people quickly find that some prompts work better than others. It turns out that giving grandmotherly instructions like 'make sure you think carefully about it' actually tend to do good.""Prompt libraries can be as simple as a collection of conversation starters like the library Johnson &amp; Johnson's uses in order to reduce friction for employees who use its internal generative AI chatbot.""We’re using [our chatbot] to upload internal documents and create summaries or ask ad hoc questions,"" a spokesperson for Johnson &amp; Johnson said. ""We created a prompt library with thought-starters to help employees explore potential use cases relevant to different areas of the business.""Meanwhile other prompts aim to minimize the risk of hallucination—the term for the frequent occurrence of AI producing facts that sound plausible but aren't true—or to format answers in the most efficient way possible.Story continues""We have different prompting libraries depending on the use case or expected output,"" Christian Pierre, Chief Intelligence Officer &amp; Partner at creative agency GUT, told Fortune. ""[Our] strategists and data analysts share a library and a 'keyword cheat sheet' with specific keywords that can drastically change the output. For instance, we know that just by adding 'Provide it as a boolean query,' ChatGPT will write boolean queries that we can use in our social listening tools.""Often undesired outputs are the result of the absence of knowledge in the relevant data set. For example, a language model will likely supply an answer to a prompt asking why John got hit by a car—even if it has no information about John or the accident in the first place.""The tendency of all of these models is that if there are facts, they will use them."" Professor Manning said, ""And if there aren't facts, [it will] write plausible ones with no basis in truth.""Thus crafting the perfect prompt requires providing an intense level of context, the tweaking of keywords, and a precise description of the desired form. Those who pride themselves on creating these call themselves prompt engineers.Taking it even furtherUnfortunately, even the most optimized prompt can fall short of what big companies are looking for.""These large language models are very generically trained,"" Beatriz Sanz Sáiz, global consulting data and AI leader at Ernst &amp; Young, told Fortune. ""What we are trying to achieve is really bring in the best, let's say tax professionals, to really fine-tune, retain, and retrain.""Ernst &amp; Young has created an in-house AI platform called EY.ai. Microsoft provided the firm early access to Azure OpenAI, in order to build a secure and specialized system. This has helped increase the speed of the system and protect sensitive data and, most importantly, provided EY with the ability to adjust the model to fit its desired outcomes.""If there's one task that you want to do—like reading insurance claims, writing out what we're doing with them, and what the reason for it was—and if you've got a fair number of examples of that from your past business,"" Professor Manning explained, ""you can then fine-tune the model to be especially good at that.""Fine-tuning is done by someone with machine learning experience, rather than a prompt engineer. At this stage, the company may decide to shrink the dataset by removing unnecessary stuff, like the ability to write haiku, to fixate the model on a specific function.Ernst &amp; Young has specialized its system further by creating a library of embeddings.""Think of [embeddings] as additional data sets that you put into the model,"" Sáiz said. ""We can connect all the dots by bringing together the tax knowledge, the country regulation, maybe also the sector knowledge.""By plugging-in these additional datasets, the model becomes hyper-specific to its purpose. Companies are finding the best AI recipe entails building on a controlled dataset, injecting it with a library of embeddings, and querying with customized prompts.""Typically now what we'll be able to do is assess clients, not on the expertise of an individual tax team but on the collective knowledge that EY has created for years,"" Sáiz explained. ""And not just in one jurisdiction, but globally across multiple jurisdictions.""Sáiz believes that the personalization of AI models through finely tuned in-house models and embedding libraries will be crucial to the future of companies using AI. She also predicts that the importance of prompts will decrease as AI gets more intelligent.However, Professor Manning believes the future will be mixed. While specialized systems will exist for high volume tasks there is also room for generalized models that require engineered prompts for irregular tasks, such as writing a job advertisement.""Those are great tasks you can give to ChatGPT these days,"" Professor Manning told Fortune. ""I think a huge space of companies can very successfully have someone who learns a bit and gets perfectly decent at writing prompts and getting great results out of ChatGPT.""This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"
104,77a2251d-689d-39e6-89a5-c1472d35230e,JNJ,2023-10-14,Top 30 Oncology Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-30-oncology-companies-world-164641236.html,1697215601,STORY,"['JNJ', 'GSK', 'SNY', 'MRNA']","[In this article, we shall cover the top 30 oncology companies in the world. To skip our detailed analysis of the global oncology industry in 2023, go directly and see Top 10 Oncology Companies in the World.According to a report by McKinsey and Company, the economic outlook for the US healthcare industry in 2023 appears grim, primarily due to non-transitory inflation rates, a glaring healthcare worker shortage and endemic COVID-19. However, according to expanded projections, healthcare profit pools are expected to rise at a CAGR of more than five percent from $654 billion in 2021 to $790 billion in 2026. Although the top oncology companies in the world are navigating significant headwinds, improvement efforts in the global pharmaceutical and biotech industries are aiding the healthcare sector in overcoming challenges in 2024. To read about countries with high cancer rates, check out our coverage of the 20 Countries With The Highest Rates of Cancer.How To Win In Oncology: Emerging TrendsAccording to a report by McKinsey and Company, oncology is one of the world's largest and fastest-moving therapeutic areas, valued at around $203.4 billion in 2022. The market is expected to reach $470.6 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 8.8%. As of 2022, the oncology market represents more than 27% of pharmaceutical sales in the US, with more than 40 FDA approvals in 2022 alone, according to the American Association for Cancer Research. However, according to McKinsey, the oncology segment is also increasing in competitiveness, with more than forty percent of the industry preclinical pipeline now in oncology and nearly all top ten players boasting a commercial presence. In order to bolster positioning within the market and win the incredibly cutthroat and complex oncology space, it is imperative for top oncology companies like Eli Lilly &amp; Company (NYSE:LLY), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Merck &amp; Co. (NYSE:MRK) to focus on a set of core capabilities.Story continuesAccording to an annual report by the IQVIA Institute, one of the primary trends driving the oncology sector in 2023 is democratized innovation. Although much of innovative science is carried out largely by non-Big Pharma players, the number of pharmaceutical companies exploring collaborative and innovation-driven models are on the rise. Furthermore, the level of venture-capital investment has also continued to rise, with oncology receiving more than 200 rounds of venture-capital investment between 2009 and 2020.With data collection practices assuming increasing importance in the current business climate, precision medicine is beginning to represent the vanguard of modern oncology, largely evident by the increasing number of differentiated cancer phenotypes, patient populations, and therapy options available. In this area, one of the most essential components for efficient drug development are biomarkers, with the number of biomarker-coupled therapies tripling since 2012. For top players like Eli Lilly &amp; Company (NYSE:LLY), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Merck &amp; Co. (NYSE:MRK) to continue to dominate the current oncology landscape, they will have to develop suitable identification processes for appropriate biomarkers, show their prognostic capabilities, develop companion diagnostics, and reach patients who have the most to gain from this kind of innovation. In this effort, the top oncology companies in the world can learn from the rare-diseases segment, which combine engagement with patient-advocacy groups, the review of oncologists' patient records, and foster partnerships with testing companies to identify patients who are likely to invest more in immunotherapy.Furthermore, investments in the development of mRNA vaccines for cancer has more than doubled since 2018, with focus largely reserved for solid, malignant tumors. The pandemic shifted interest towards mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, and one of the primary reasons why companies like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) were able to develop the vaccines so quickly is largely due to decades of preexisting research on mRNA vaccines in oncology. Since then, oncology companies are renewing their focus on the development of mRNA vaccines for solid melanomas, with oncology vaccines making up for more than 8% of the mRNA pipeline in 2022. Many of the top 30 oncology companies in the world are operating in the 15 Best Countries for Cancer Treatment.Advanced Analytics in Oncology: An OverviewAccording to a report by McKinsey, the oncology industry has been making significant strides in integrating advanced analytics and machine learning in modern oncology. Researchers have successfully constructed a model which can accurately estimate molecular subdivisions in head and neck melanomas using radiomics -  a machine learning technique which can aid in the identification, classification, and observation of solid tumors from CT, MRI, or PET scans, rather than depending completely on radiographers and needlessly painful biopsies. In other companies, machine-learning models have been deployed to out-perform board-certified dermatologists in pinpointing melanoma through mere image recognition. However, according to the report, many prominent oncology companies like Eli Lilly &amp; Company (NYSE:LLY), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Merck &amp; Co. (NYSE:MRK) have still been slow in the systematic application and integration of advanced analytics in their oncology operations, despite the fact that it has proven to deliver unprecedented value at each stage of the product life cycle.One of the primary reasons for this is the lack of data scientists with expertise in oncology -  a major impediment for top oncology companies which want to apply advanced analytics in their product development. However, an even bigger roadblock is an internal and external culture which is uncomfortable with the degree of experimentation inherent in developing advanced-analytics capabilities. Hence, even some of the top oncology companies like are delaying and avoiding the steep learning curve.To develop advanced-analytics capacities, oncology companies need to invest in the development of a strategic road map. In the absence of an effective and calculated strategy, a company cannot encourage senior leadership to align and commit to priority efforts. Secondly, companies will need to invest in a strong team with technical and business skills. Although large pharmaceutical companies do have a significant number of data scientists, their job descriptions are largely limited to commercial analytics. To harness the complete power of data analytics, companies will need to devote specialist resources to different therapeutic areas.Top oncology companies will also need to spearhead any potential advanced analytics program with existing data assets. Although the quality, availability and cost of oncology-specific data sets have significantly improved in the last decade, data still remains relatively sparse overall, with depleted samples sizes especially with respect to biomarker data. Furthermore, clinical data usually does not include the specific results of tests or procedures. Hence, to kickstart a potential program, oncology companies need to pick and put to use as many existing data assets as possible, including data on rebate cards, oncology practices and cohorts, and oncologists who have partaken in clinical trials.Lastly, companies need to challenge the prevailing assumption that data and models must be absolutely perfect before being leveraged for critical decision making. McKinsey argues that this orthodoxy may be correct when applying analytics to selected areas like R&amp;D, but other areas within the company have a lot to gain from imperfect analytical tools. Additionally, considering how fast standards of care can change, companies will inevitably struggle to make any headway if they lie in wait for perfection. Lack of transparency and training can also prove to be a substantial impediment in adoption of analytical tools in company operations. Overcoming such complex and deep-rooted problems require a deliberate attempt by a company to change its internal culture and transform its employee training practices.Top Oncology Companies in the WorldPhoto by National Cancer Institute on Unsplash Our MethodologyTo compile our list of the top 30 oncology companies in the world, we carefully screened the global oncology market to pick some of the largest, or most prominent players in the sector.

105,d369e996-7e57-3839-926e-2c021f9cae28,JNJ,2023-10-14,"J&J (JNJ) to Report Q3 Earnings, Its First After Unit Spin-Off",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/j-j-jnj-report-q3-134900298.html,1697204940,STORY,['JNJ'],"[Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ will report third-quarter 2023 results on Oct 17, before market open. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 7.28%.Factors to ConsiderIn May 2023, J&amp;J spun off its Consumer Health segment into a newly listed company called Kenvue, which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange with effect from May 4. J&amp;J owned 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue’s common stock then and was the majority shareholder. In August, J&amp;J made an exchange offer for shares of Kenvue that it owned to complete the separation. After completion of the exchange offer, J&amp;J now has a 9.5% stake (approximately 180 million shares) in Kenvue’s common stock, which it may monetize in a tax-efficient manner in 2024.With the complete separation of the Consumer Health segment, J&amp;J has now become a two-sector company focused on the Pharmaceutical and MedTech fields. Kenvue now operates as a separate and fully independent company. The third-quarter results will be the first quarterly update for the new J&amp;J after the Consumer Health spin-off.J&amp;J’s Pharma segment is expected to have contributed to the top line, led by higher sales of key products such as Darzalex, Stelara, Tremfya and Erleada. J&amp;J announced on the second-quarter conference call that sales growth in the Pharma unit in the second half could be slightly higher than the first half.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Stelara is $2.64 billion, while our model estimates are pegged at $2.65 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Darzalex is $2.54 billion, while our model estimate is $2.57 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tremfya is $801 million, while our model estimate is $867.9 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Erleada is $660.0 million, while our model estimate is $614.3 million.Importantly, new drugs like Carvykti, a BCMA CAR-T therapy approved for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and Spravato, approved for treatment-resistant depression, are likely to have contributed to top-line growth.Story continuesHowever, like the previous few quarters, lower sales of its key medicine, Imbruvica, are likely to have hurt the top line in the third quarter. Rising competitive pressure in the United States from novel oral agents is likely to have hurt sales of Imbruvica.

107,41103cf9-f2aa-3a84-aef7-ae7c77463924,MOS,2023-10-14,The Mosaic Company's (NYSE:MOS) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mosaic-companys-nyse-mos-stocks-142709848.html,1697207229,STORY,['MOS'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Mosaic's (NYSE:MOS) stock increased significantly by 6.3% over the past week. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Mosaic's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Mosaic How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Mosaic is:18% = US$2.2b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.18.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Mosaic's Earnings Growth And 18% ROEAt first glance, Mosaic seems to have a decent ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 14% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This probably laid the ground for Mosaic's significant 55% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Mosaic's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 14%.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is MOS worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether MOS is currently mispriced by the market.Is Mosaic Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Mosaic's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 6.0% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (94%) of its profits. So it looks like Mosaic is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Besides, Mosaic has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 24% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 7.6%, over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Mosaic's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

A quality probe tied to the production flaw is ongoing, Boeing said in an email.The US planemaker fell the most intraday in seven weeks after the outlet reported on the expanded scope of the work. Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc., which supplies the faulty assemblies, dropped the most in almost a month.The widening checks and potential rework suggest it will take longer than expected to correct the issue — raising new uncertainties around Boeing’s fourth quarter deliveries and financial prospects ahead of its earnings report later this month. Ryanair Holdings Plc, a major 737 Max customer, told Bloomberg on Thursday that Max delivery delays have worsened.“The new issue will cause additional disruption to BA’s 737 deliveries, which likely will result in further delays for a month or so,” TD Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr said in a research note.This “could jeopardize” Boeing’s delivery target of at least 400 737s this year, and hurt fourth-quarter cash flow, von Rumohr said, “However, it shouldn’t jeopardize BA’s planned ramp in 737 production,” he said, referrring to Boeing’s stock ticker.Boeing shares declined 2.8% as of 12:09 p.m. in New York, after falling as much as 4.3%. Spirit, which dropped as much as 4.6%, was down 0.5%.Executives of the two companies said in September that the improperly drilled holes in the aft pressure bulkhead involved relatively easy repairs but were time-consuming. At the time, the companies were using X-rays to inspect about half of the 1,000 holes drilled on the component.Story continuesPrevious inpsections tied to laser-guided assemblies have been expanded to include work done by hand, The Air Current said.“We continue to take the time necessary to ensure each airplane meets our standards and regulatory requirements prior to ticketing and delivery,” Boeing said in an emailed statement.Spirit said separately that it continues to work with Boeing to address required rework.Fixes to the aft pressure bulkhead appear to be more challenging, Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O’Leary told Bloomberg at an event in Brussels on Thursday. He said he no longer expected to receive 57 aircraft by the end of June, cutting into the airline’s flying capacity next summer.Boeing notified the Federal Aviation Administration of its initial findings this week, along with customers already facing delivery delays of the Max 8 jets, according to The Air Current report.The quality lapses are disrupting deliveries as Boeing works to ramp up production of the Max, potentially risking friction with more customers. The 737 is the largest moneymaker for Boeing as well as for Spirit, whose CEO stepped down this month.Each 737 Max delivery adds about $10 million to the company’s free cash flow, estimates Jefferies Inc., and steadily rising output of the workhorse jet is critical if Boeing is to reach its target of producing $10 billion in cash by 2025 or 2026.(Retops with details of 737 inspections, analyst comment)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?Pro-Putin Propaganda Flows Onto Android via Google LoopholeThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedEurope at War Can’t Ignore Poland’s Bitter Election©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Valued at $10.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2024. The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Huntington Beach, CA.What’s Supporting Boeing?For 100 years, Boeing has been leading unmanned technology innovation and integration from sea to air to space.Boeing’s Echo Voyager is a fully autonomous XLUUV-class Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (“UUV”) that can be used for various missions, which were previously impossible due to traditional UUV limitations. The vehicle’s advanced autonomy enables it to perform at sea for months at a time, delivering a more affordable, mission-capable solution over traditional UUVs.Prior to Echo Voyager, Boeing developed Echo Seeker and Echo Ranger, autonomous and large UUVs as test beds for its current XLUUV.The aforementioned discussion reflects the proven expertise of BA in the UUV space. This is likely to have led to a steady inflow of contracts for the company, like the latest one. This, in turn, should bolster its revenue generation prospects from the UUV product line.Growth ProspectsThe recent tiff between Ukraine and Russia has led other nations to strengthen their defense landscape to deter any war-like situation. UUVs are noted for their ability to carry out dangerous maritime operations, such as mine countermeasure missions and harbor patrol. Therefore, as investments in undersea warfare capabilities have increased manifold, so has the demand for state-of-the-art UUVs. Long-endurance, autonomous maritime vehicles offer new ways to gather data and conduct missions in the ocean and communicate across domains to deliver actionable intelligence.With technological advancements, nations are more rapidly adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to increase the autonomy of UUVs. As a result, hefty investments in developing and acquiring autonomous marine systems can be expected in the coming days, thereby boosting the UUV market. To this end, the Fortune Business Insights firm projects the global unmanned underwater vehicle market to witness a CAGR of 13.5% during the 2023-2030 period.Story continuesSuch growth trends should boost Huntington Ingalls along with other defense primes like Huntington Ingalls HII, General Dynamics GD and Lockheed Martin LMT, which have a strong presence in the unmanned underwater vehicle market.Serving customers in more than 30 countries, Huntington Ingalls provides design, autonomy, manufacturing, testing, operations and sustainment of unmanned systems, including UUVs and unmanned surface vessels. Its REMUS family of UUVs consists of low logistics UUVs that can be rapidly deployed from any vessel of opportunity, with their common usage in mine countermeasures, search and recovery and antisubmarine warfare.Huntington Ingalls’ long-term earnings growth rate is 6.6%. The Zacks consensus estimate for HII’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 3.5% from the 2022 reported figure.General Dynamics’ Bluefin SandShark is a one-person-portable, low-cost, autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle designed to leverage today’s miniaturized sensors and emerge as the development platform for the next generation.General Dynamics boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.2%. GD shares have rallied 7.3% in the past year.Lockheed has more than four decades of experience developing unmanned and robotic systems for the sea. LMT’s Marlin autonomous underwater vehicle system offers a range of civilian and military customers with a quick and safe way to conduct subsea surveys and inspections.Lockheed’s long-term earnings growth rate is 8.4%.

These defects have weighed Boeing delivery figures down to their lowest rate since 2021.Yahoo Finance Live takes a closer look at Boeing's stock and what these delays could mean for major airline operators.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- Let's also take a look at Boeing because shares on the move to the downside this morning. Now, off just about 3%. The 737 Max quality problem for the company continues this week. There are more planes to inspect than the company initially anticipated.Now, Boeing saying that the incorrectly drilled holes are not in immediate flight safety issue. But the defect also impacts its delivery numbers, dropping them to the lowest since 2021 because the company is inspecting and fixing thousands of planes. We see that pressure on the stock once again today. And unfortunately, this is nothing new for Boeing-- a number of setbacks, a number of quality issues here over the last couple of years affecting the timeline, affecting the delivery number here.That they're expecting over the last couple of years, once again, not out of the woods yet. And we're seeing some of that concern reflected in shares today.- I mean, I can't be the only traveler right now who inspects the seat back puck in front of me to see what type of aircraft I'm on when I get on there. I-- and I have nothing against Boeing at all here. I think, especially, here in the US, in terms of the comeback story that they have needed to be and moving past the culture of negligence that came to light, as a result of investigations, following the two fatal crashes that took place of Boeing 737 MAX jets internationally here and the grounding, and then the re initiation of making sure that they could get back to aerospace, it's a large story that we've covered for years at this point, and then, getting back to deliveries.Story continuesAnd so, just continuing to make sure that they're dotting the I's crossing the T's. And making sure that every one of those large plane orders that they receive because this is a company between Boeing and Airbus, really accounts for over 90% of the large plane manufacturing and orders that come through. So, they're amazingly important here.But, I mean, there are some times when I get on a flight, and I say, Jesus be an mcast Because at the end of the day, there still is that concern that they have to go out and do quality control over the perception, the sentiment. However, I've still flown on a few of them successfully, and well, yes, thank goodness.- You've probably never gotten off the plane once you realize.- I don't think I've ever gotten off a plane.- Just might have been a little bit more sitting on the edge of your seat.- Yeah. I just-- I just pray.- No. But certainly-- and that also is a huge issue here for Boeing, right? Just the customer backlash and whether or not people are willing or want to get on these flights because of the issues that they have had over the last couple of years.- Right. They were waiving change fees for a while. And so now, all that consider, I think that it's been a tremendous effort by this new regime, this new executive management team to make sure that they are getting most of, and getting a lot of that positive net promoter score back, especially among their largest customers out there as well.]"

(NASDAQ:ILMN), has received an order from the European Commission (EC) directing the company to divest GRAIL.Receipt of the order is an important next step in evaluating divestiture options for GRAIL. Illumina is committed to resolving all issues regarding GRAIL in a timely manner, with the objective of achieving the maximum value for shareholders and the best outcome for GRAIL. Notably, the terms of the order provide for flexibility in transaction structure, an encouraging outcome from Illumina's ongoing dialogue with the EC.Under the terms of the EC's order, Illumina will have twelve months to divest GRAIL, with the potential for a three-month extension, and will be permitted to explore a range of structures including, but not limited to, a third-party sale or a capital markets transaction. Illumina will lead the divestiture process and, with the assistance of financial and legal advisors, has already begun the preparatory work necessary for divestment, if needed.Consistent with the previous interim measures orders, Illumina is required to continue funding GRAIL until any divestiture. In the instance of a capital markets transaction, Illumina must capitalize GRAIL at the time of the transaction with two-and-a-half years of funding based on GRAIL's long-range plan. The order also provides for Illumina to retain a stake in GRAIL of up to 14.5% and reestablish the royalty arrangement it previously had in place with GRAIL.Illumina maintains that the Commission does not have jurisdiction over this acquisition. The company's jurisdictional challenge remains pending at the European Court of Justice (ECJ).If Illumina wins its jurisdictional challenge at the ECJ, the basis for the EC's divestiture order would be eliminated. However, if Illumina is not successful with either its ECJ jurisdictional appeal or in a final decision of the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the company will divest GRAIL.Story continuesIllumina's third quarter 2023 earnings call is scheduled for November 9, and company leaders will respond to further questions from the investment community at that time.Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking StatementsThis release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Among the important factors to which our business is subject that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements are: (i) our ability to agree on a divestment plan with the European Commission pursuant to the divestiture order it has issued; (ii) our ability to timely execute a strategic alternative that maximizes the value of GRAIL to our stockholders given the parameters required by the divestiture order; (iii) the risk that ongoing legal proceedings challenging the decisions of the European Commission and the U.S Federal Trade Commission do not result in favorable outcomes for us; (iv) the risk that distractions associated with the potential divestment of GRAIL and associated legal proceedings or regulatory obligations will harm our business, including current plans and operations, together with other factors detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, or in information disclosed in public conference calls, the date and time of which are released beforehand.

(NASDAQ:ILMN) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Illumina Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$683.7mUS$844.8mUS$1.06bUS$1.39bUS$1.62bUS$1.83bUS$2.00bUS$2.14bUS$2.26bUS$2.37bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 17.01%Est @ 12.55%Est @ 9.43%Est @ 7.25%Est @ 5.72%Est @ 4.65% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$639US$739US$865US$1.1kUS$1.2kUS$1.2kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$11bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.4b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.2%) = US$51bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$51b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$26bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$37b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$130, the company appears quite good value at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Illumina as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.952. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for IlluminaStrengthNet debt to equity ratio below 40%.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for ILMN.OpportunityForecast to reduce losses next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

119,22e7f47c-0e6b-3d14-bf2c-cfa3765dfb88,SO,2023-10-14,A Note On The Southern Company's (NYSE:SO) ROE and Debt To Equity,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/note-southern-companys-nyse-roe-120029752.html,1697284829,STORY,['SO'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Southern How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Southern is:8.6% = US$3.0b ÷ US$35b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.09 in profit.Does Southern Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that Southern has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Electric Utilities industry (8.3%).roeSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential. To know the 4 risks we have identified for Southern visit our risks dashboard for free.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Southern's Debt And Its 8.6% Return On EquitySouthern does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.76. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.TE Connectivity's stock is believed to be modestly undervalued, according to GuruFocus Value calculation. At its current price of $121.78 per share and the market cap of $38.20 billion, TE Connectivity's stock is believed to be modestly undervalued. Consequently, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.TE Connectivity (TEL): An In-Depth Analysis of Its Market ValueLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength has a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Therefore, it is important to carefully review the financial strength of a company before deciding whether to buy its stock. A good starting point for understanding the financial strength of a company is looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. TE Connectivity has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.27, which is worse than 84.26% of 2363 companies in the Hardware industry. However, GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of TE Connectivity at 7 out of 10, indicating that the financial strength of TE Connectivity is fair.Story continuesTE Connectivity (TEL): An In-Depth Analysis of Its Market ValueProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is less risky. A company with high profit margins is usually a safer investment than those with low profit margins. TE Connectivity has been profitable 9 out of the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $16.40 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $6.48. Its operating margin is 16.73%, which ranks better than 89.57% of 2444 companies in the Hardware industry. Overall, the profitability of TE Connectivity is ranked 8 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of TE Connectivity is 8.2%, which ranks better than 60.99% of 2325 companies in the Hardware industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 11.7%, which ranks better than 51.79% of 1954 companies in the Hardware industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, TE Connectivity's ROIC was 14.79, while its WACC came in at 7.86.TE Connectivity (TEL): An In-Depth Analysis of Its Market ValueConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of TE Connectivity is believed to be modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks better than 51.79% of 1954 companies in the Hardware industry.

You can skip our detailed analysis on how countries are racking up their defense capabilities amid military escalation in Ukraine and its impact on the armaments industry by heading over to the 10 Strongest Armies in the World in 2023.Plenty has unfolded in the last three years. Azerbaijan has seized parts of the Nagorno-Karabakh region from Armenia, Afghanistan has fallen to the Taliban, there are regular border skirmishes between China and India, Russia’s war in Ukraine is nearing 600 days of conflict, and if that was not it, the Middle East has gone up in flames once more with already thousands killed after Palestinian group Hamas’ attack on Israel, which was followed by Tel Aviv ordering aerial strikes on the Gaza strip.These events have forced several countries, especially those in Europe, to increase their defense spendings to bolster national security. According to figures shared by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), global defense spending was estimated to be $2.2 trillion in 2022, with Europe having its steepest rise in 30 years. The United States, China, and Russia account for more than half of all global spending. NATO countries’ defense expenditure was up 0.9% in 2022 year on year, to total $1.2 trillion last year.The surge in spending has created a boom for armament manufacturers. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) generated $66 billion in revenues and net earnings of $5.7 billion in 2022. It is the largest federal defense contractor in the United States, having received over 11% of all DoD spending in 2022, including a $950 million missile order from the Pentagon to refill stockpiles in Ukraine. A number of countries are also equipping their air force with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 fifth-generation fighter jet. You can read more on this in our article, Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023.Story continuesThis year, the company’s financial performance is even better, as noted by Chairman and CEO, Jim Taiclet, in Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s Q2 2023 Earnings Call:Our Q2 financial results were strong, with sales of $16.7 billion up 8% year-over-year and double-digit growth at both aeronautics and space. Backlog reached a record level of $158 billion, up $8 billion from year-end resulting from a book-to-bill of $1.7 in the quarter. Orders included an approximately $8 billion option of [Indiscernible] for the 126 F-35 for production lot 17 as well as significant awards to ramp up emissions [Ph] at MSC.This highest ever backlog gives us visibility into multi-year sales of our key programs and enables our suppliers to be better positioned to meet growing demand. Segment operating profit of $1.9 million in the quarter reflected an operating margin of 11.1%. Free cash flow was $771 million and we remain committed to advancing technology and expanding production capacity. So in Q2, we invested $356 million of company funded R&amp;D and $329 million of capital expenditures to address our customer’s needs and requirements. Meanwhile, we returned almost two times free cash flow to the shareholders. Given the strong results in the first half of this year, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2023 financial outlook. For sales we’re raising the midpoint of our range by $1 billion to revise expectations of between $66.25 billion to $66.75 billion and free EPS we are raising the midpoint of our range by $0.35, to revise the expectation of between $27 to $27.20 per share.Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX)’s net earnings rose 8.9% from 2021 to total $14.1 billion in 2022. The armament manufacturer won 6.1% of all defense-related contracts from the DoD during the year, including an order worth nearly $1 billion from the U.S. Air Force to develop scramjet-powered hypersonic cruise missiles.Revenues of Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) were also significantly higher in 2022 compared to the previous year. The company is known for its expertise in space and command and control systems. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is also the manufacturer of the strategic bomber B-21 Raider, which is currently under development for use by the U.S. Air Force.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:Our other purchase was Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), a US defense contractor whose stock price experienced a pullback. We like that Northrop has a larger presence than its rivals in the most favorable subcategories of the defense industry-namely, nuclear weapons, space systems, and what’s known as C4ISR (which stands for Command, Control, Communications, Computers. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance). C4ISR refers to digital systems that translate data picked up from different sensors-such as an incoming hypersonic missile or advancing troops-into a common format, and then escalate key information to the right people These differentiated technologies are especially relevant in a time of increased geopolitical tensions. Northrop also benefits from large barriers to entry in this stable industry, which should enable continued strong earnings and cash flow.All being said, recent conflicts have also demonstrated how having large armored, artillery, and infantry units are not enough to gauge a military’s strength. Having an experienced and battle-hardened force, technological advancement in military hardware, and a strong and stable economy are just as important determinants that are often overlooked. Russia, for instance, has the highest number of nuclear weapons, tanks, rocket artillery (MLRS), and self-propelled artillery in the world, and ranks third when it comes to armored fighting vehicles. Despite being a force on paper, it has struggled to find its way in Ukraine in a war that has stretched nearly 600 days with no end in sight.MethodologyWe have ranked the 25 strongest armies in the world by analyzing key metrics pertaining to strength of ground forces, such as active manpower, tanks fleet, armored fighting vehicles, rocket projectors, attack helicopters and nuclear weapons. Collectively, these metrics have been assigned a weight of 50% to determine our rankings. 30% is made up of countries’ military technological capabilities, which is a product of the technological advancement levels of a country coupled with its defense spending. Lastly, we have also considered the sizes of the economies and assigned GDP a 20% weightage. This is a key metric because only a strong economy would be able to sustain a capable ground force over the long run.Data has been sourced from the Global Firepower Index 2023 and our recent articles, 25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023, 50 Largest Economies in the World Ranked by PPP and 25 Most Technologically Advanced Countries in the World in 2022.25 Strongest Armies in the World in 2023Photo by Joel Rivera-Camacho on UnsplashLet’s now head over to the list of the strongest armies in the world in 2023.25.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with NKE.As of 2023-10-13, Nike Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $48.57. It's currently trading at a price of $99.25. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -104.34%. The company is significantly overvalued.Unlocking Intrinsic Value: Analysis of Nike IncThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Nike Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$3.24GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.62%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 9.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=29.36Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=19.21Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=48.57Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $41.91. This valuation indicates that the Nike Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -136.82%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Lending activities were muted in the quarter on higher interest rates and an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Specifically, demand for commercial and industrial loans (which constitute a large part of Zions’ loan portfolio) remained weak in July and August, per the Federal Reserve’s latest data.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets for the third quarter is pegged at $81.4 billion, indicating a decline of 1.3% from the prior quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for the metric is $81.5 billion.During the quarter, the Fed continued to tighten its monetary policy (pausing hikes in the September FOMC meeting), raising interest rates by another 25 basis points. The policy rate now stands at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5%. Nevertheless, the inversion of the yield curve and rising funding costs are expected to weigh on Zions’ net interest margin (NIM) and net interest income (NII) to some extent. But high rates are likely to have offset this.In early September, at the Barclays Global Financial Conference, ZION presented updates for July and August. It showed marked improvement in NII and NIM for both July and August from the June 2023 level.The consensus estimate for NII is pegged at $593.2 million, indicating a marginal rise on a sequential basis. Our estimate for the metric is the same as the consensus number.Other Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q3Fee Revenues: The consensus estimate for commercial account fees of $44.36 million implies a quarter-over-quarter fall of 1.4%. Our estimate for the metric is $37 million.The consensus estimate for dividends and other income of $11.4 million indicates a fall of 56.2% from the previous quarter.The consensus estimate for retail and business banking fees is pegged at $15.7 million, suggesting a 1.6% decline. We project the metric to be $13.5 million.Story continuesSubdued volatility across markets and products is likely to have hurt Zions’ capital markets and foreign exchange fees. The consensus estimate for the same is $25.1 million, suggesting a fall of 6.9%. Our estimate for the metric stands at $22 million.The consensus estimate for card fees of $25 million suggests a marginal decline from the previous quarter. Our estimate for card fees is $21.3 million.However, the consensus mark for loan-related fees and income is $19.5 million, implying a quarter-over-quarter increase of 2.7%.

(Operator Instructions) Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.John M. CampbellGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financials referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.Story continuesCharles W. ScharfThanks very much, John. I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review third quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some third quarter highlights. Our results reflected the progress we're making to improve our financial performance. Revenue, pretax provision profit, net income, diluted earnings per common share and ROTCE were all higher than a year ago. Our revenue reflected strong net interest income growth as well as higher noninterest income as we benefited from higher rates and the investments we're making in our businesses. Our expenses declined from a year ago due to lower operating losses. As expected, net charge-offs have continued to increase from historical low levels, and we increased our allowance for credit losses primarily driven by our office portfolio as well as growth in our credit card portfolio. Average commercial and consumer loans were both down from the second quarter as higher rates and a slowing economy have weakened loan demand, and we've continued to take some credit tightening actions. Average deposits also declined from the second quarter and a year ago driven by consumer spending as well as customers migrating to higher-yielding alternatives. Consumer spending remains strong with third quarter year-over-year growth rates for both credit and debit card spending increasing from the second quarter. Now let me update you on the progress we're making on our strategic priorities, starting with risk and control work, which remains our top priority. As time goes on, we continue to make the progress necessary to complete our work. I've said that we have detailed project plans which track interim deliverables, not just the date the work is to be finalized and turned over to the regulators for validation. The work is not finalized all at once. It's not as if there's a big bang conversion at the conclusion of a big body of work. It's just the opposite. Building our risk and control framework is a continuous ongoing effort. We are implementing changes throughout the life of the project, and we track effectiveness along the way. The numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment, but we will not be satisfied until all of our work is complete. We remain focused on the work ahead even as we are making progress. But I will repeat what I've said in the past: regulatory pressure on banks with long-standing issues such as ours continues to grow. And until we complete our work and until it is validated by our regulators, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions. Additionally, until our work is complete, we could find new issues that need to be remediated, and these may result in additional regulatory actions. We also continued to take steps to advance our business strategy, which includes focusing on our core business and customers. We sold approximately $2 billion of private equity investments in certain Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners funds. We are also making a number of investments to better serve our customers. As a leader in U.S. middle-market and asset-based lending, we're focused on finding ways to support our clients with the recently announced strategic relationship with Centerbridge Partners. Our middle-market clients will have greater access to alternative sources of capital that can be used to pursue a broader set of growth and value-creation initiatives across a variety of market conditions. Branches continue to play an important role in the way we serve our customers, and we continue to optimize our network, but we also look at targeted expansions in markets where we see opportunities for our franchise. Last week, we announced we are expanding our branch network in Chicago, where we only have 7 branches today. We also continue to make enhancements to our mobile app. And in the third quarter, we launched Stock Fractions, giving Wells trade clients the ability to buy fractions of company's stocks to help build a diversified portfolio regardless of stock price. Just yesterday, we announced the expanded availability of LifeSync to all consumer customers. Available on the mobile app, LifeSync is our personalized digital approach to aligning customers' goals with their money and was launched to all Wealth and Investment Management clients earlier this year. Customers' goals entered in LifeSync will be visible to bankers to enhance need-based conversations. We also expanded the capabilities of Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant and recently added the ability for customers to communicate with Fargo in Spanish. These enhanced capabilities are just the latest of our ongoing investments to deliver seamless and consistent experiences across all our channels. We are seeing more mobile adoption momentum, adding over 520,000 mobile active users in the third quarter, our best quarterly growth since first quarter of 2021. We've also continued to make important hires who bring expertise to Wells Fargo and businesses we're looking to grow. Before I highlight some of our new leaders, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Bill Daley, Vice Chairman of Public Affairs, who's retiring at the end of this year for all he has accomplished since he joined the company in 2019. Bill has been an invaluable asset to the company, and we benefited from his long experience in both the public and private sectors. During this time at Wells Fargo, he helped strengthen our relationships with communities we serve, established new programs in housing and small business, and worked to rebuild our reputation both locally and nationally. I'm pleased to have announced that Tom Nides joined Wells Fargo as Vice Chairman earlier this month. Tom will be a close adviser to the senior management team on a range of issues, and we will work alongside our business leaders as we continue to expand our relationships with clients. The breadth of Tom's experience across the public and private sectors will be an important asset to us as we continue to move the company ahead. We continue to invest in our Corporate Investment Banking business with new co-heads of equity capital markets. These new hires complement the other important hires we've been making over the past year. We also hired a new Head of Trust Services and Chief Fiduciary Officer in our Wealth and Investment Management segment and a new Head of Affluent and Premier Banking in consumer, small and business banking. We also continue to focus on better serving our communities. During the third quarter, we published 3 reports that provided overview of the work we are doing to build a sustainable, inclusive future in communities we serve; outline our strategic approach to managing the risks associated with climate change in deploying capital to support the transition to a low-carbon economy; and describe our methodology for aligning our financial portfolios with pathways to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and presenting interim emissions-based targets to track that alignment. We continue to make progress on our special-purpose credit program initiative we announced last year to help drive economic growth, sustainable homeownership and neighborhood stability in minority communities. We recently expanded our special-purpose refinance offers to prequalified Hispanic customers with Wells Fargo mortgages to refinance at a lower than market rate. The program launched last year for Black or African American customers has seen strong results, and the Hispanic offer has shown similar levels of customer engagement. We also announced that we're offering a $10,000 homebuyer access grant that will be applied towards down payment for eligible homebuyers who currently live and work purchasing homes in certain underserved communities in 8 metropolitan areas. And we now have 14 HOPE Inside centers of Wells Fargo branches, including the first focusing on serving the Navajo community. The centers help engage and empower communities to achieve their financial goals through financial education workshops and free one-on-one coaching. Looking ahead, the U.S. economy has continued to be resilient with key support from the labor and strength -- from the labor market and strength in consumer spending. Delinquencies have continued to deteriorate at a relatively slow consistent rate without signs of acceleration across our portfolios. Our base case remains a continued slowing of the economy, but we remain prepared for a wide range of scenarios given there is still significant uncertainty ahead. Regarding capital, the Basel III Endgame proposal included higher capital requirements as we expected. It's a complicated set of rules. But at this point, if nothing changed and we didn't take actions, we estimate that our RWA would increase by approximately 20%. There are some items that increased our capital requirements that we are hopeful will be adjusted, and we will be participating and sharing our perspectives on the proposed rules during the 120-day comment period. Additionally, we are evaluating changes we may make based on the proposed rules. Fortunately, we come into this from a strong position as our current capital levels are above the estimated regulatory minimum plus buffers. However, we still need to decide how much of an additional buffer we want to maintain and what mitigating actions we may want to take to reduce the impact of the new rules. At this point, we still see a path to concurrently increasing our level of CET1 as appropriate, increasing our dividend and repurchasing common stock. Levels of each will be influenced by CCAR, the finalization of the proposed rules and economic conditions. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.Michael P. SantomassimoThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the third quarter was $5.8 billion or $1.48 per diluted common share, both up from the second quarter and a year ago. Our third quarter results included $349 million or $0.09 per share of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior period tax matters. Turning to capital and liquidity on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio increased to 11% in the third quarter, 2.1 percentage points above our new regulatory minimum plus buffers effective on October 1. This was up from 10.7% in the second quarter as higher earnings, the approximately 14 basis point benefit from the sale of certain private equity investments and lower risk-weighted assets were only partially offset by share repurchases and dividends. During the third quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion in common stock. Our strong capital levels position us well for the anticipated increases related to the Basel III Endgame proposal released in the third quarter. Based on where we ended the quarter, we estimate that our CET1 ratio would be 50 basis points above the fully phased-in required minimum if the proposed rules were implemented as written after factoring the growth in RWAs and the resulting decline in our stress capital buffer as well as the impact of the new G-SIB buffer calculation changes. Importantly, this is an early estimate, subject to change and is before any actions we may take to mitigate the impact of the new rules. Looking forward, we expect to continue to have capacity to increase our CET1 ratio, while we plan to continue to repurchase shares as we wait for the capital rules to be finalized. Turning to credit quality on Slide 5. As we expected, net loan charge-offs continue to increase, up 4 basis points from the second quarter to 36 basis points of average loans. Commercial net loan charge-offs declined modestly from the second quarter to 13 basis points of average loans as lower losses in our commercial and industrial portfolio were partially offset by $14 million of higher losses in commercial real estate. We had $32.2 billion of office loans, down 3% from the second quarter, which represented 3% of our total loans outstanding. Vacancy rates continue to be high and the office market remains weak. Our CRE teams continue to focus on monitoring and derisking the portfolio, which includes reducing exposures. As we highlighted in the past, each property situation is different and there are many variables that could determine performance, which is why we regularly review this portfolio. As expected, consumer net loan charge-offs continued to increase and were up $98 million from the second quarter to 67 basis points of average loans. Residential mortgage loans continued to have net recoveries, while our other consumer portfolios all had higher losses with the largest increase in our auto portfolio, which was up from the second quarter seasonal lows. Nonperforming assets increased 17% from the second quarter as growth in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans more than offset the decline in commercial and industrial as well as modest declines across all consumer portfolios. The decline in commercial industrial nonaccrual loans was primarily due to payoffs and paydowns, which is a good reminder that the resolution of nonperforming assets doesn't always result in charge-offs. The increase in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans was driven by a $1.3 billion increase in the office nonaccrual loan. Moving to Slide 6. Our allowance for credit losses increased $333 million in the third quarter primarily for commercial real estate office loans as well as for higher credit card loan balances, which was partially offset by a lower allowance for auto loans. Since the composition of our office portfolio is relatively consistent with what we shared with you in the past few quarters, we did not include a separate commercial real estate slide this quarter. However, we did update the table showing the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate, including the breakdown of the office portfolio. We've not seen significant increases in charge-offs in our commercial real estate office portfolio yet. However, we do expect higher losses over time, and we continue to increase the coverage ratio in our commercial and -- in our CIB commercial real estate office portfolio from 8.8% at the end of the second quarter to 10.8% at the end of the third quarter. On Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down modestly from both the second quarter and a year ago. While we continue to have good growth in credit card loans from the second quarter, most other portfolios declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 195 basis points from a year ago and 24 basis points from the second quarter due to the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 5% from a year ago predominantly driven by deposit outflows in our consumer and wealth businesses, reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher-yielding alternatives. Average deposits also declined in Commercial Banking, while they stabilized in Corporate and Investment Banking. As expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase, up 23 basis points from the second quarter of 236 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates. However, the pace of the increase has slowed, and our percentage of average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased modestly from the second quarter to 29% but remained above prepandemic levels. Turning to net interest income on Slide 8. Third quarter net interest income was $13.1 billion, up 8% from a year ago, as we continued to benefit from the impact of higher rates. The $58 million decline from the second quarter was due to lower average deposit balances, partially offset by 1 additional day in the quarter and the impact of higher interest rates. Last quarter, we increased our expectations for full year 2023 net interest income growth to approximately 14% compared with 2022, which was up from our expectation of 10% growth at the beginning of the year. We now expect full year 2023 net interest income growth to grow by approximately 16% compared with 2022 with the fourth quarter 2023 net interest income expected to be approximately $12.7 billion. The expected decline in interest income in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by our assumptions for additional deposit outflows and migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits as well as continued deposit repricing, including continued competitive pricing on commercial deposits. Turning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense declined from a year ago driven by lower operating losses and increased 1% from the second quarter driven by higher operating losses, severance expense and revenue-related comp. Last quarter, we updated our expectations for full year 2023 noninterest expense excluding operating losses to approximately $51 billion. We now expect it to be approximately $51.5 billion or approximately $12.6 billion in the fourth quarter. The increase reflects additional severance and other onetime costs, revenue-related compensation and some lags in realizing efficiency saves. We've reduced head count every quarter since the third quarter of 2020, and it was down 3% in the second quarter and 5% from a year ago. We believe we still have additional opportunities to reduce head count and attrition has remained low, which will likely result in additional severance expense for actions in 2024. We are working through our efficiency plans now as part of the budget process. Additionally, if the FDIC deposit special assessment related to the events from earlier in the year was finalized in the fourth quarter, it would increase our expected fourth quarter expenses. And finally, as a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating results. Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 10. Consumer, small and business banking revenue increased 7% from a year ago as higher net interest income driven by the impact of higher interest rates was partially offset by lower deposit-related fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year. Charlie highlighted the investments we were making in our Chicago branch network, and we're also making investments in refurbishing branches across our existing network. Additionally, we are bringing our digital onboarding experience to our branches, creating a fast and easy experience for our customers. At the same time, we've reduced our total number of branches by 6% from a year ago. Home lending revenue declined 14% from a year ago due to a decline in mortgage banking income driven by lower originations in servicing income, which included the impact of sales of mortgage servicing rights. We continue to reduce head count in home lending in the third quarter, down 37% from a year ago, and we expect staffing levels will continue to decline. Credit card revenue increased 2% from a year ago due to higher loan balances, partially offset by introductory promotional rates and higher credit card rewards expense. Payment rates have been relatively stable over the past year and remained above prepandemic levels. New account growth continued to be strong, up 22% from a year ago, reflecting the continued success of our new products and increased marketing. Importantly, the quality of the new accounts continue to be better than what we were booking historically. While the majority of new cards were to existing Wells Fargo customers, we're increasingly attracting more customers that are new to Wells Fargo. Auto revenue declined 15% from a year ago driven by continued loan spread compression and lower loan balances. Personal lending revenue is up 14% from a year ago due to higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 70% from a year ago and 18% in the second quarter. We continue to make progress on the strategic plans we announced earlier this year, including focusing on serving Wells Fargo Bank customers as well as borrowers in minority communities. We did not originate or fund any correspondent mortgages in the third quarter. The size of our auto portfolio has declined for 6 consecutive quarters, and balances were down 9% at the end of the third quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volumes declined 24% from a year ago, reflecting credit tightening actions as well as continued price competition. Our origination mix continue to shift towards higher FICO scores, reflecting the credit tightening actions we've taken over the past year. Debit card spend increased 2% from a year ago with growth in most categories offsetting declines in fuel, home improvement and travel. Credit card spending continued to be strong and was up 15% from a year ago. All categories grew from a year ago, including fuel, which rebounded after declining in the second quarter. Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 23% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 3% year-over-year due to higher loan balances as well as higher revenue from renewable energy investments. Loan balances were up 7% in the third quarter compared to a year ago driven by growth in Asset-Based Lending and Leasing. Average loans were down 1% in the second quarter due to declines in Middle Market Banking. After increasing the first half of the year, revolver utilization rates declined in the third quarter to levels similar to a year ago. Turning to Corporate Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 20% from a year ago driven by higher lending revenue, stronger treasury management results reflecting the impact of higher interest rates, and higher investment banking revenue reflecting increased activity across all products. As Charlie highlighted, we've continued to hire experienced bankers, helping us deliver for our clients and positioning us well when markets improve. Commercial real estate revenue grew 14% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and higher revenue in our low-income housing business, partially offset by lower loan and deposit balances. Markets revenue increased 33% from a year ago driven by higher revenue in structured products, equities, credit products and foreign exchange. We've had strong trading results for 3 consecutive quarters as we benefited from market volatility and the investments we've made in technology and talent to grow this business. Average loans were down 5% from a year ago driven by banking, reflecting a combination of slower demand payoffs and modestly lower line utilization. Average loan balances were stable with the second quarter. On Slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 1% compared to a year ago driven by higher asset-based fees due to the increased market valuations. Net interest income declined from a year ago driven by lower deposit balances as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives as well as lower loan balances. While average deposits were down compared to both the second quarter and a year ago, the pace of the decline slowed in the third quarter. As a reminder, the majority of WIM, Wealth and Investment Management advisory assets were priced at the beginning of the quarter, so third quarter results reflected market valuations as of July 1, which were higher from a year ago. Asset-based fees in the fourth quarter will reflect market valuations as of October 1, which were also higher from a year ago but were lower from the third quarter pricing date. Average loans were down 4% from a year ago primarily due to a decline in securities-based lending. Slide 15 highlights our corporate results. This segment includes venture capital and private equity investments, including the investments and funds that we sold in the third quarter. The sale had a nominal impact on third quarter net income. Revenue declined $345 million from a year ago, reflecting assumption changes related to the valuation of our Visa B common stock exposure as well as lower venture capital revenue. In summary, our results in the third quarter reflect a continued improvement in our financial performance. During the first 9 months of this year, we had strong growth in revenue, pretax provision profit and diluted earnings per share compared to a year ago. As expected, our net charge-offs have continued to slowly increase from historical lows, and we increased our allowance for credit losses by over $1.9 billion this year primarily for CRE office loans and higher credit card loan balances. We are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit tightening actions where we believe appropriate. Our capital levels have increased, and we expect to continue to return excess capital to shareholders. We will now take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from John McDonald of Autonomous Research.John Eamon McDonaldI wanted to ask about the expenses, Mike. Obviously, improving efficiency has been a big goal of yours. You made progress even while investing in regulatory. What are the additional opportunities to improve efficiency from here as you head into 2024? I know you're probably not ready to give guidance for '24 yet, but are you going into the budget planning with a mindset that they should be roughly flattish? Any comments you can give on that would be helpful.Michael P. SantomassimoYes. Sure. Thanks, John. First off, let's just make sure we keep it all in context, right? We set out a program almost 3 years ago now to cut roughly $10 billion. And I think that's all still on track. We've brought head count down 40,000 from -- or closer to 50,000 from the peak back in [2025]. So sort of very good progress to date. And I think as Charlie and I have both said over the last couple of quarters, we still have more to do to make it more efficient. And I would say there are very few parts of the company that we would say are optimized at this point. Now some have more opportunity than others, some require investment in terms of automation and technology, some don't. But I do think that we go into the budget process and even just how we operate every quarter with a very disciplined approach to every single area of the company saying, what are we going to do to continue to drive more efficiency there while we make investments as well. And we highlighted some of those that we've been making on in the prepared remarks. But I think it's the same mindset we've been bringing to it now for the last few years, and I think we're going to continue to do that. Where that ultimately ends up, we'll share for next year. We'll share with you in January, like we always do.John Eamon McDonaldOkay. Fair enough. And then on the net interest income outlook for the fourth quarter, are you building in assumptions -- you mentioned deposit outflows and mix shift assumptions? Are they assuming that things accelerate from here or similar to what you've seen this quarter? It seems like a pretty big sequential decline. Just kind of wondering what some of the assumptions are there.Michael P. SantomassimoYes. No, look, I think as you can -- as we've talked about over the last -- it feels like forever, but certainly last 4, 5, 6 quarters now, there's still a lot of uncertainty out there in terms of how the path of both the deposits and pricing will shape up. Whether it's all the quantitative tightening, all of the -- any competitive reactions we may see from others. And so I think we continue to think that we're going to see these trends appear at some point. Now we've been pleasantly surprised this -- to date this year that hasn't progressed as fast as we thought it would, but at some point, it will. And so hopefully, we'll find ourselves in a position where it doesn't move as maybe fast as we've modeled in terms of pricing. But we still -- all those trends are going to happen and are happening as you look at shifts between noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing, you're seeing deposit costs continue to increase. And on the consumer side, you see people spending their money. And so exactly at what pace those things are all going to keep going as we certainly modeled it, but we try to give you a base case forecast that we can hit under a bunch of different scenarios, and this is the same.OperatorThe next question will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.Steven Joseph ChubakSo wanted to start, Charlie, because you had made some comments about capital targets and those potentially evolving. The inflation RWA from Basel III Endgame that you guided to does bring your CET1 minimum to 8.5%. You alluded subtly, mind you, to the possibility of managing to a lower target. Since 150 bps management cushion does feel excessive, what are some of the factors that would compel you to maintain a larger cushion than peers and maybe continue to run at or above 10%?Charles W. ScharfWell, let me just -- I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Mike. We were not trying to -- or I was not trying to give any direction about where we thought the appropriate buffer would be. We're just trying to be very factual about where we are. And once everything is finalized, we'll determine what the right buffers are and we'll communicate those. So please don't try and read any more into what I said other than just that.Michael P. SantomassimoYes. And I think, Steve, I know your estimate might be 150 basis points. But I think what we've talked about over time is that at least at this point, we've been saying our buffer is probably closer to 100% -- 100 basis points over wherever the right minimum might be. And that may evolve, as Charlie said. I think as you look at Basel III, the increase in RWA is driven by the things that are probably pretty obvious, whether it's operational risk plus the -- some of the other factors. But operational risk is certainly going to be one of the bigger pieces of it. And so I really do think that we have to see how the final rule shakes out next year. We're hopeful that there'll be some changes to areas that we think just makes sense from aligning sort of the capital requirements to the risk while also maybe moderating some of the operational risk increases as well. And so we're going to engage as we go there. But one of the factors that we've talked about now for a while in terms of how big our buffer should be is that we needed the rules to be finalized and so could that lead you to having a slightly smaller buffer than what we would have had in the past? Potentially. But I think we have to get there and get these finalized, and then we'll also take actions once we have good clarity on what's going to change or not change as we go over the next year. So I mean, we're probably 9 months to 12 months away from getting a final rule, and so we still have a little bit of time for this to play out.Steven Joseph ChubakAnd for a follow-up, just on the trading business. It continues to surprise positively versus expectations. You cited some of the investments that you've made, the benefits of volatility. But with revenues running multiples above what we've seen in prior years and that $1 billion-plus bogey being reached for 3 consecutive quarters, I was hoping you could just speak to whether we should be underwriting $1 billion-plus as a new normal or if there were any cyclical benefits or anomalous benefits that maybe we shouldn't be underwriting go forward. Just trying to think about what the normalized level of trading revenue should be given some of the investments you've made scaling of that business.Michael P. SantomassimoYes, I'll take that. Look, I think we've -- as you said, we've just been methodically investing in the capabilities with a focus on supporting our core clients more than -- more -- with more capabilities versus like trying to expand the scope of what we do in a way that just doesn't fit who we are. And so I think that's what you've seen us try to do there in those businesses. So businesses like FX and rates and just -- it's sort of methodically sort of adding people in a couple of slots or improving technology. And we've certainly been the benefit of some volatility in the market this year. So as you know, that could change pretty quickly one way or the other. But I think as we look at some of these businesses, what we're focused on is just adding more clients, more flows, more incrementally each month and each quarter. And so whether it ends up being $1 billion plus or minus a quarter -- per quarter, I think we'll see as we go, but we're pretty pleased with what we've seen so far. And there isn't a big onetime event that happened in the quarter that drove the results. And so that's good to see as well. And you're also not seeing big growth in market risk RWA as we do this as well. And so that's part of what we've been trying to do as well is kind of sweat the balance sheet more and make sure that we're getting paid for the exposure and the risk we've got there. And so we're happy to see that, it's starting to come together. And we're under no illusions, though, that 3 quarters is like success, right? We've got to do this over a long period of time and continue to add capabilities and clients.OperatorThe next question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler.Robert Scott SiefersWas hoping maybe, Mike, you could spend another moment sort of discussing RWA mitigation in light of the Fed capital proposals. I guess, specifically, I was hoping for maybe a little more color. I know you touched on it in some of the earlier remarks, but the sale of the $2 billion in private equity. And then maybe if you could also discuss the new agreement with Centerbridge for direct lending, just sort of how all these factor into your thinking here.Michael P. SantomassimoSure. When you look at mitigation -- I'll just give you some examples of the types of things we're thinking about. So when you look at securities finance transactions, you have haircut -- collateral haircut floors that get implemented. And I don't want to get too technical on it because -- but there's some technical requirements there that just don't seem to make sense to us. And so -- but if they do get implemented as written, we'll adapt and we'll change the way we -- what collateral we require from clients to do trades or we'll reprice them. And so there'll be a number of things that we can do like on transactions like that, but it gets very, very technical for each of the underlying deals.There will be -- I know others have talked about this, too. We'll have to decide how much tax equity investing we do in renewables. If the risk weights hold there, it's just -- the math just doesn't make sense from a return perspective. And so we'll probably have to do less -- we'll probably do less of those. And so there's a number of things like that as you go through each of the underlying portfolios just don't make sense. And we're going to -- we'll make the adjustments as we need to.Now we're also in a position where we've got plenty of flexibility as we talked about in the prepared remarks, right? Our capital levels today are there with a buffer already. And so we have the flexibility to handle it however we think makes sense to -- for each of the underlying businesses. And what we want to make sure we do is like we're building real businesses and client relationships over a long period of time. So it's not about necessarily walking away from clients. It's about finding ways to serve them in ways that both makes sense for them and from a return perspective for us.But it's going to be a very, very granular conversation. Some of it will be repricing. You got 364-day revolvers that will need to be repriced. You've got -- there's a whole bunch of very technical things like that, that will get done over time once the rule is finalized.Switching to the partnership we have with Centerbridge. Look, it's a -- we have been getting demand from clients for a while now in the middle-market kind of mid-corporate space for solutions to help them in financing that they need where it likely wouldn't make sense for us to put on our balance sheet anyway. And so instead of having telling clients we can't help them or having them go direct to somebody else, we built a partnership with Centerbridge that allows us to remain an adviser to a client and help them solve a problem they may have. And so that's the way we're thinking about it.And we're excited to work with Centerbridge and that team, and they're a very high-quality team, they have done a lot over time. And I think this gives us another arrow in the quiver to help us provide solutions for clients. And so it's early, and it will grow over time, hopefully. And hopefully, clients will see it in the same way.Robert Scott SiefersOkay. Perfect. And then maybe as a follow-up, might want to revisit -- or I was hoping to revisit the NII discussion for a bit. I certainly appreciate all the comments on continuing mix shift and deposit pricing pressure. But I guess, as we get to this level at the end of the year, is the thought that there would still be on balance downward pressure on NII beyond that? Or is -- as you see it, is there enough kind of asset repricing opportunity that would ultimately allow things to settle out maybe sooner as opposed to later?Michael P. SantomassimoYes. I mean we'll see. I think we do need to wait until we get towards the end of the year and into January for us to give you a real view on 2024. I mean, I think what the last number of quarters have -- just show over and over and over that there's a lot still to play out here. And to get too far ahead of ourselves on it for next year, I think, would be a mistake at this point.So -- but look, the same -- it's the same drivers we've been talking about for a while, right? It's like what's going to happen with deposits, the mix, the pricing. And then to a lesser degree, right now, it's loan growth, but it still matters over a long period of time as well.OperatorThe next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.Matthew Derek O'ConnorCan you just elaborate on the comment of tightening the credit box a bit? And then, I guess, specifically in credit card, thoughts there? I know you've been leaning into it and have had real good growth. And I think it's still only about 5% of your loan book, but wondering your thoughts of, is this really the right time to be leaning into credit card maybe as we're kind of later cycle.Michael P. SantomassimoYes. I'll start with credit card and come back to the broader point. So we started on a journey to transform that -- the card business back in the fourth quarter of '19, so right after really Charlie started. And what we've done since then is really refreshed -- almost completely refreshed the product line. We still have a little bit more to do there.And so part of what you're seeing come through in the results is actually putting out good products that people want to buy. And you're seeing really -- we have really good new account growth in the quarter, probably our best quarter in quite some time. And so it starts with just having a good product and good service behind it, and that's the key driver, I think, of what you're seeing here.On the credit side on the new originations, the new accounts we're adding are really good relative to the back book. And when you look at both -- and even when you dig a little bit deeper there, there's -- the majority of them are still Wells Fargo Bank customers, but we're seeing more and more traction with non-Wells Fargo customers, so first-time customers.And when you look at those first time to Wells customers, those -- the credit profile is really good. And so we feel comfortable with like the risks that's being added there. And we're going to continue to look for pockets of risk. And if we see them, we'll tighten it down. But in terms of what we're seeing in originations, we feel good about what we're seeing so far.Just more broadly on credit, we've said now for probably the last 4 or 5 quarters, we've been kind of incrementally tightening the credit box on the consumer side for a while. Whether it's really across the board in home lending, auto, card, personal loans, really every single one of them had some credit tightening. And it's been a bit incremental over the last 4 or 5 quarters.And so I would still sort of think of that as like taking that last 1% or 2% or 3% of origination out that doesn't make sense in what could be a more difficult economic environment. It's not wholesale shifts in sort of the approach or the underlying box that we're operating in. It's really sort of modest and incremental. And then on the...Charles W. ScharfJust on -- and just to be clear, I mean it's -- and it's the very basic stuff. It's just upping the lower FICO boundaries, it's layered risks. And so it's just as you continue to make these changes, you just -- we're just continuing to do the same types of things without just wholesale exits or anything like that. It's just kind of a smart tightening.Michael P. SantomassimoYes. And then outside the consumer space -- outside of consumer, really the only place that we've meaningfully tightened credit over the last couple of years or a few years is commercial real estate. And other than that, I think there's probably some minor tinkering, but we haven't really changed the appetite much outside of commercial real estate.Matthew Derek O'ConnorOkay. That's helpful. And then just a clarification on the severance costs. Can you give us what the absolute amount was this quarter? I think you gave us the change versus a year ago and linked quarter. But what was the absolute level this quarter?Michael P. SantomassimoYes, there wasn't a lot a year ago, so it's not far off of the total. So a small difference, but it's -- there wasn't a lot.Matthew Derek O'ConnorOkay. So about $200 million?Michael P. SantomassimoYes. And again, that will sort of evolve as we go. I mentioned that in my script as we look at next year and the attrition rates that we're seeing.OperatorThe next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.John G. PancariOn the commercial real estate front, I know you cited the increase in the office loan loss reserve from -- in the CIB from 8.8% to 10.8%. Could you just comment there in terms of what were some of the anecdotal drivers for the loan loss reserve increase? Do you think you could have incremental increases here? And maybe cite some of the office revaluations you've seen as you have seen with the underlying collateral change hands or reappraisals, if you can give us some color there as well.Michael P. SantomassimoYes, sure. When you -- the hard part of office right now is that there aren't a lot of trades happening yet, right? There's a few in certain cities, and they're all a little bit different in their complexion. So you still have somewhat limited information in price discovery in a lot of places. And so we're doing -- we do a lot of our own work to try to evaluate each of the underlying properties and what they could be worth in a bunch of different scenarios.And then it's feeling like the appraisal market is starting to kind of catch up, where they're -- we're seeing appraisals that are more realistic and more updated. So that's certainly bringing in different data points as we look at it. And as we looked at the quarter, we sort of look at all those data points and the underlying loans and try to do our best to come up what we think the different range of loss could look like here, and that's what's embedded in the results.Hopefully, we end up being conservative. But nonetheless, it's possible that this plays out this way. And so we haven't really seen any losses of significant yet -- significance yet, but we will. And it just takes some time for it to play out for each of these underlying situations, probably longer than any of us would hope to -- you'd hope that you could bring some of this stuff to resolution maybe faster than it really takes in real life. But it's really looking at all the data points, the limited sales, the new appraisals that are coming through and then our own analysis for each of the underlying properties.John G. PancariGot it. All right. And then separately, also within commercial real estate, we're getting more and more questions around multifamily exposures and just how well they really are holding up given some supply issues in certain markets. Can you just comment there? Are you seeing any noteworthy stress or any changes to underlying reserve for that book?Michael P. SantomassimoYes. Not a lot. I mean you certainly see certain markets that might appear to have some oversupply in condos in certain places. But it feels like that will work itself out over a period of time. We're not seeing real systematic stress in the portfolio at this point.John G. PancariGot it. If I can ask just one last one. On the head count cuts, you mentioned you look at every business pretty much. Are any head count cuts occurring yet in the risk area or anything? Or any changes with the contracts with consultants in the risk overhaul area at all?Michael P. SantomassimoYes. No. Look, the only thing I'd say on the risk and reg work is that we're going to spend whatever we need to spend and put the resources we need against it to get it done. And we're going to continue to do that towards...Charles W. ScharfJust to be clear, like we're not cutting head count related to that. In fact, it's probably the opposite when you look over the past bunch of quarters. The only thing which goes up and down is depending on where we are with work with outside consultants, that number will go up or down in a given quarter. But we've also said, if we can use outside resources to help get the work done sooner, we're going to. So as we think about -- just as we think about our efficiencies, that is just not in scope at this point or for the foreseeable future.OperatorThe next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS.Erika NajarianMy first question is on the revenue side. As a follow-up to Chubak's line of questioning, I think not only the trading numbers come better this year but also investment banking. And so I hear you loud and clear about the cyclicality of the trading business. But I guess, help us get a sense of if the industry wallet, for example, return to 2019 levels, do you think that you're going to have generally a higher share of revenues in capital markets versus 2019?And sort of the sub-question to that is, as we think about the investments you have already made, what are the other businesses that could potentially surprise us to the upside, where it's not quite optimized yet in terms of its revenue production? And obviously, everybody is thinking about -- you mentioned card, and also everybody is also thinking about wealth management and investment advisory revenues.Charles W. ScharfYes. Well, let me take a shot at that. I think -- listen, I think the answer is, to your question on share, without getting overly specific, yes. We think when you look at where we stand on our growth in our Corporate Investment Banking share, whether it's on the trading side or whether it's on the fee-related side, our shares have grown. And certainly, on the -- within the fee-based side of the business, we do hope they continue to grow. That's driven by the investments that we're making, and investments meaning people in terms of growing our capabilities. And we've got clear goals and targets by person that we bring on in terms of what we expect, and we're going to be tracking to that.And just a reminder, certainly, when we brought some of the people on, they bring some -- a lot of clients with them, some new transactions in the short term. And we've been beneficiaries of that over the last couple of quarters just as we brought some people on. But these are relationship-based businesses, and transactions don't occur every single quarter. So we would expect our share to continue to grow.And I just -- as a reminder, without taking any additional risk overall because we're taking the risk today relative to the exposures that we have. When we look at where we can see growth coming overall across the entire company, we just go business by business.Absolutely, in our consumer small business -- small and business banking segment because -- we've basically been treading water there as we stabilized that business going back to the issues that we had there, which was an incredibly difficult thing to do, and we did. And we've not been our -- we've not been on our front foot in that business. We're going to do it in a very different way than this company did it historically, but there are opportunities to be on the front foot and actually grow share on an organic basis. And so incredibly excited about that opportunity.Not excited, as I said, about growing share in mortgage. That's not where we're after, and it's -- we've talked about where we're going there. Auto, it's about returns, not growth. So don't look for a lot of growth there unless the dynamics change in the business.Mike spoke about card. We're incredibly energized by the evidence that shows with our brand and our relationships. When you put a great product out there, we get positive selection and real growth. And by the way, look at our spend numbers. I mean, if you want to see like the impact of what it means, just look at the spend that we're seeing, which is much higher than the industry levels.Our wealth business, as you pointed out, no question, also treaded water for a long period of time. We're attracting people and teams. We're rolling out new products. So we feel really good about the opportunities that are there. And in the middle market segment, where it's a little bit more business as usual because it is such a strong franchise for us. Even there we look back at our asset-based lending businesses and the things that we acquired from GE. They ran as stand-alone businesses here for a long period of time, and we didn't bring the entire product set of Wells Fargo to those customer bases. Under Kyle Hranicky, Kristin Lesher and MK DuBose or Mary Katherine DuBose are diligently working through that and bringing the Investment Banking product to that entire Commercial Banking product.So I could go on. I just -- it should be broad-based. Most of it, by the way, I'll point out, in terms of when we see opportunities, it is fee-based growth, not because we've dictated that but just because we focused a lot on NII as a company historically. And we just have a lot of opportunities that we get excited about that will play out over a period of time.Erika NajarianGot it. And I think that excitement is clear, Charlie. And my second question is, given all of that and taking a step back, I totally think it's too early, I agree with you, to give anything on '24 expenses. But more broadly discussing, do you feel like the company is in a little bit of an inflection point? Because on one hand, Mike was saying that very few parts of the bank are optimized. On the other, I think you guys mentioned that the head count is not going the other way, and perhaps it's really some of the outside consulting fees that could go up and down.But I'm wondering if you get asked about expenses in a framework of flat, but then all of this momentum on the revenue side seems to be on the comp. And I'm wondering how you think about as you budget for the company and as you think about just getting to that 15% ROTCE. Let's just put Basel III Endgame aside in terms of the denominator, how do you balance some of the shareholders and the analysts that are asking you about expenses in the context of flat versus the revenue momentum that obviously would need expenses to keep sustaining versus that revenue momentum that you seem to be so excited about?Charles W. ScharfLet me start. And Mike, you either come in at the end or just make your comments along the way as well. So I think, first of all, we think about it as 2 separate exercises that we go through. And we're -- and it's very timely because we're in the middle of going through the exercise for next year as most other companies are, which is this company is not efficient, like period, end of story. And I've described this, even with all of the reductions that we've made, it's not surprising because as you peel the onion back, other things present themselves. And so you go in order of things that are more obvious and things like that.But when we sit around as a management team, we feel great about the progress. And there's no clearer way to see that than in the head count numbers, which ultimately drive the expense of the company. And if I -- if we stood here and told you we were going to drive the head count down that much in this period of time, I'm not sure you'd have believed us. And so when we say we're going to do something, we really do mean it. And so when we sit around as a team, there are many more efficiencies to get, and we're diligently working through those.And then separately from that, it's when we talk about making investments in the place, are we getting the payoff for it. And so whether it's the marketing in the card business, where we're spending more money on marketing than we had in the past, and we feel great about, as Mike pointed out, not just the volumes that we're getting but the underlying quality relative to how we had modeled that. And so we'll do that with each and everything. And ultimately, we need to make a decision as we finalize the process of the budget on just much more of a tactical basis of how those things net out.We're well aware of what shareholders are looking for. We're well aware of that the expense side of this company is an important equation in what investors look at us in terms of where -- unlocking value, and we hear it and we see it. And whatever -- wherever we come out when we talk to you about our guidance for next year, we will explain why we got to where we are. It's going to include efficiencies. It's going to include investments. Whether it -- where that turns out, we'll explain it. And I think so far, we've been as clear and as transparent as we can be. And if it makes sense, you'll like it. And if it doesn't, you won't, you'll tell us. But so far, we've been able to have alignment there.But overall, I would just -- it's a long way of saying it's not lost on us that we have opportunities both to reduce expenses and to invest. But making sure that the overall expense level stays in check at this place is incredibly important to us, and we have to prove that there is revenue growth there supporting investments that we make.OperatorThe next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America.Ebrahim Huseini PoonawalaJust Mike, for you, a follow-up on credit on the C&amp;I side, nonaccrual charge-offs staying relatively flat, I guess, as we look through. Just talk to us in terms of when you look at that C&amp;I book, is the impact of the Fed rate hikes felt by your customers? And how are you seeing that evolve? Is your expectation right now -- you talked about the economy being resilient. Are you seeing any soft spots on the C&amp;I book where you're seeing bankruptcies rise within a vertical or a certain segment?Michael P. SantomassimoYes. No. Look, I think, first, you're seeing it come through in utilization of revolvers, right, which are pretty much in check. They aren't moving much and down in some cases. So people are building less inventory given where rates are. They may be making decisions on like how fast they want to invest in their businesses. And so you're seeing that come through in loan growth, which is sensible for -- from their perspective. I think when you look across the portfolio, there are certainly pockets where you may be seeing margin compression still or different idiosyncratic issues. But across the portfolio, the credit quality is still good.Ebrahim Huseini PoonawalaGot it. And do you think your customers have felt the hit from higher rates already? Or is that on the comp?Michael P. SantomassimoWell, I think they certainly felt it so far, right? I mean most of them have variable rate loan that they service, right? And obviously, the longer rates stay high, they'll maybe feel it more. But certainly, I think they've been impacted.Ebrahim Huseini PoonawalaGot it. And just one separate quick question on the outlook for buybacks. Clearly, big reset lower. When you -- like your excess capital, you probably have visibility on the worst case on Basel Endgame. It's very rare that banks have excess capital when the stocks are actually near lower. You're creating a tangible book. How do you think about outside of CCAR and SCB in terms of near-term pace of buybacks over the next few quarters relative to what we did this quarter?Michael P. SantomassimoYes. I mean we're not going to get into like trying to give you a view on pacing. We're going to go -- we have a process we go through every quarter to look at all of what's happening. First, it's like how are we going to support clients, what's demand we're seeing, what kind of risks are out there. In the fourth quarter, we have the FDIC special assessment potentially coming. And so there's a whole -- each quarter, there's going to be a whole range of things that we're going to go through, and then we'll decide on pacing.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.Gerard Sean CassidyMike, can you share with us -- you and your peers as well as investors, we've all been surprised with how this deposit trend of moving money into higher-yielding deposits is going slower than expected. Is there any categories within your deposit base, whether it's just your regular consumer deposits or high net worth deposits or the nonoperational commercial deposits that are moving more slowly? And I know you said you expect it to happen, but is there something that says that it could pick up real quickly in the next 6 months? Or is it just a gradual increase?Michael P. SantomassimoYes. Gerard, I think you really have to pick it apart by the different businesses. I think in the wealth business, it moved quite quickly, right, in terms of seeing deposits decline from where they were and that is now moderated. So it's good to see that, that shifting has sort of slowed down quite substantially in the quarter relative to the last couple of quarters.On the consumer side, the majority of the deposits that we've got sit in accounts with less than $250,000. And so to some degree, these are -- to a large degree, these are operational accounts for folks. And so there's some portion of those funds that are never going to move into other places because people need it in the accounts to live and operate every day.And so I think what's -- so I think we'll see, right? And I think we're all in a bit of uncharted territory at this point with rates being where they are and the pace at which they got there, quantitative tightening happening. And so I think we need to be prepared for it to change. Exactly at what pace and over what period of time, we'll see. But we certainly haven't seen deposit pricing move the way we modeled it a year ago, for sure.Gerard Sean CassidyVery good. And then as a follow-up, since you and Charlie have come on board, Wells has really done a very good job in returning that excess capital. I understand everything that's going on today, and you guys described it in your comments. Can you share with us, is there a buffer -- whenever the final numbers come out, are you guys planning to keep a 100 basis point buffer above that? Or any color there?Michael P. SantomassimoYes. We haven't decided exactly what it'll -- what the buffer will look like after Basel III is implemented. But so far, what we've said a number of times is that 100 basis points is about where we've been targeting. Obviously, we've been running above that for a while. But we'll -- as we get a better view of where these rules are going to shake out, we'll probably talk about that more. But I would think that 100 basis points, at least for now is sort of the bottom end of the range.OperatorAnd that was our final question for today. I will now turn it over to your speakers for closing remarks.Charles W. ScharfAll righty. Everyone, thank you very much. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Take care now.OperatorThank you for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect.]"

There was plenty to like in these results, with the resilient economy helping keep credit demand positive and higher interest rates allowing them to charge more for those loans.The bank worries that took center stage in the Spring following the Silicon Valley Bank fiasco have largely eased by now. But those solvency worries were never meant for JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells Fargo, which reported Friday morning, and Bank of America, which is scheduled to report Tuesday morning (October 17th). These banks regularly go through the Fed’s stress tests and are perceived as very safe. The issue was all along centered on the small and mid-sized regional banks that will start reporting results this week.We should note, however, that while JPMorgan and its large money-center peers may not have been directly affected by the Spring banking issue, even these big players have been forced to offer higher rates to depositors, pressuring their net interest margins. The Q3 net interest margin at JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells was still up from the year-earlier period but has notably leveled off relative to what they reported in the preceding quarter.Getting back to the group’s Q3 results, the fact that the investment banking business was weak during the period was no surprise for the market. This has been the trend for many quarters, as tighter monetary policy and other macroeconomic headwinds have weighed on deal-making. While there are some ‘green shoots’ on the horizon concerning M&amp;A and IPO activities, no significant improvement is expected in these businesses until the macroeconomic ‘clouds’ lift.JPMorgan beat on the top and bottom-lines, with Q3 earnings and revenues up +35.1% and +21.9% from the year-earlier levels, respectively. The bank benefited from First Republic purchase, but JPMorgan’s earnings would still be up significantly relative to the year-earlier level as a result of improved margins.Story continuesAnother area of potential read-through from these reports is commercial real estate exposure, which is a far bigger line of business for the regional operators than for the likes of JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells Fargo. Of these three, Wells Fargo is perhaps more exposed here, as reflected in the roughly $1.2 billion reserve booking, up from $784 million in the year-earlier period, a big part of which reflected the Wells’ commercial real estate exposure.Management’s commentary about the economic outlook reflected tentativeness, citing continued downside risks, though they acknowledged the economy’s resiliency and increasing odds of a ‘soft landing’ for the economy.Bank stocks have notably lagged the broader market, particularly since the onset of regional bank worries in March. The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of JPMorgan and Wells Fargo relative to the S&amp;P 500 index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe issue with the bank stocks isn’t their current earnings power but rather how their profitability will shape up in the coming economic slowdown. Bank investors are wary of the group’s track record of making a lot of money during the good times, which the group then gives back during the bad times. The question is how ‘bad’ will the coming ‘bad times’ be for the economy and what will that do to bank earnings.Regarding the Finance sector scorecard for Q3, we now have results from 19.2% of the sector’s market capitalization in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total earnings for these companies are up +21.9% from the same period last year on +13.6% higher revenues, with 100% beating EPS estimates and 66.67% beating revenue estimates.Looking at the Finance sector as a whole, total Q3 earnings for the sector are expected to be up +9.5% on +2.4% higher revenues.As noted earlier, skeptics of the banking industry argue that the group gives away all the profits it had accumulated during the good times when the macro environment turns south. The Covid downturn was an anomaly in that respect, but there is some truth to the allegation.We will see how the economic picture unfolds in the coming quarters, but the credit quality metrics in the reported Q3 results do not point towards a material deterioration, even though delinquencies have started going up from the record low levels of the Covid years.The Earnings Big PictureLooking at 2023 Q3 as a whole, the expectation currently is of S&amp;P 500 earnings declining by -1.3% from the same period last year on +0.8% higher revenues. This would follow the -7.1% decline on +1.1% higher revenues in 2023 Q2.The chart below highlights the year-over-year Q3 earnings and revenue growth in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the following few periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see here, 2023 Q3 is expected to be the last period of declining earnings for the index, with positive growth resuming from 2023 Q4 onwards. In fact, had it not been for the Energy sector drag, earnings growth in 2023 Q3 would already be positive.You can see this in the chart below which shows the index’s year-over-year earnings growth on an ex-Energy basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the year-over-year change in net margins, with Q3 currently expected to be the 7th quarter in a row of declining margins.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchExcluding the Energy sector, however, net margins would be modestly up from the year-earlier period.One sector that has made significant progress on the margins front is the Tech sector, whose year-over-year comparison turned positive in the preceding period and is expected to expand further this quarter, as the chart below shows.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLook at current expectations for next year and the year after to understand the disconnect between the reality of current bottom-up aggregate earnings estimates and the seemingly never-ending worries about an impending economic downturn. That said, most economic analysts have been steadily lowering their recessionary odds in recent months.This Week’s Notable Earnings ReleasesJPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup weren’t the first companies to report Q3 results, as several companies with fiscal quarters ending in August that we count as part of our September-quarter tally have been coming out with quarterly numbers in recent weeks. But the reporting cycle will really get going this week, with almost 150 companies reporting Q3 results, including 54 S&amp;P 500 members.Including Friday’s results from the big banks, we now have Q3 results from 32 S&amp;P 500 members. Total Q3 earnings for these 32 index members are up +13.5% from the same period last year on +8.8% higher revenues, with 87.5% beating EPS estimates and 65.6% beating revenues estimates.The comparison charts below put the Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates at this very early stage in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe comparison charts below put the Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bank Earnings Loom: A Challenging Set up  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Last year, revenue from those two products exceeded $56 billion.But annual vaccination rates have dropped sharply since 2021 and demand for treatments has dipped as population-wide immunity has increased from vaccines and prior infections. Pfizer and rivals have begun selling an updated COVID vaccine for this fall.""We remain proud that our scientific breakthroughs played a significant role in getting the global health crisis under control,"" Pfizer CEO Albert Boura said in a statement. ""As we gain additional clarity around vaccination and treatment rates for COVID, we will be better able to estimate the appropriate level of supply to meet demand.""The drugmaker said it now expects 2023 revenue of between $58 billion and $61 billion, down from its prior forecast of $67 billion to $70 billion. It said the reduction was solely due to lowered expectations for its COVID-19 products.Pfizer said it will take a non-cash charge of $5.5 billion in the third quarter to write off $4.6 billion of Paxlovid and $900 million of inventory write-offs and other charges for the vaccine.The cost-cutting program, which will target savings of at least $3.5 billion annually by the end of 2024, will include layoffs, the company said, without providing details on how many jobs will be cut or from what areas. One-time costs to achieve the savings are expected to be around $3 billion.Shares of the New York-based company were down about 7% in extended trading.Pfizer slashed its forecast for sales of its antiviral COVID treatment Paxlovid by about $7 billion, including a non-cash $4.2 billion revenue reversal, as it agreed to allow the return of 7.9 million courses purchased by the U.S. government. It had previously expected Paxlovid revenue of about $8 billion for the year.Story continuesPfizer said that under a deal with the U.S. government, a credit for the returned Paxlovid doses will underwrite a program to supply the drug free-of-charge to uninsured and underinsured Americans through 2028 and to patients insured under the government's Medicare and Medicaid programs through the end of next year.Pfizer will also provide the U.S. government 1 million courses of Paxlovid for the Strategic National Stockpile.The company expects the drug will become commercially available to people with private insurance in Jan. 1.Pfizer also cut full-year revenue expectations for the COVID vaccine by about $2 billion due to lower-than-expected vaccination rates.Pfizer said its non-COVID products remain on track to achieve 6% to 8% revenue growth year over year in 2023.(Reporting by Michael Erman in New Jersey; Additional reporting by Sriparna Roy in Bengaluru; Editing by Bill Berkrot and Rod Nickel)]"

(NYSE:PFE) today announced that it has amended its supply agreement with the U.S. government for Paxlovid, the first oral antiviral pill approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is updating its Full-Year 2023 Guidance.Paxlovid Amended Agreement with U.S. Government Facilitates CommercializationAt the end of 2023, Pfizer will accept a non-cash return of any remaining Emergency Use Authorized (EUA)-labeled U.S. government inventory, estimated to be 7.9 million treatment courses, and in the fourth quarter, will reverse the associated revenues currently estimated to be approximately $4.2 billion.The commercial transition will begin in November 2023, as the U.S. government begins to discontinue the distribution of EUA-labeled Paxlovid. Pfizer will ensure commercial readiness by providing NDA-labeled commercial supply to all channels by the end of 2023, however, EUA-labeled Paxlovid will remain available free-of-charge to all eligible patients until the end of the year, and therefore Pfizer expects only minimal uptake of NDA-labeled commercial product before January 1, 2024.Any remaining EUA-labeled treatment courses previously purchased by the U.S. government will be converted to a volume-based credit. This credit will support continued access to Paxlovid through a patient assistance program (PAP) operated by Pfizer on behalf of the U.S. government. As part of the PAP, all federally insured patients (Medicare and Medicaid) and the uninsured will receive Paxlovid, free of charge, through 2024. Beginning in 2024, Pfizer will sell Paxlovid to privately insured patients (commercial) with prices to be negotiated with payers and offer a copay program through 2028. The PAP will continue to provide access to Paxlovid to eligible uninsured and underinsured patients through that same period.Additionally, Pfizer will manage and supply 1.0 million treatment course U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to enable future pandemic preparedness and refresh stock prior to expiry through 2028.Pfizer will recognize revenues as product is delivered beginning in 2024.Updates Outlook for COVID-19 ProductsPfizer also announced additional clarity on its full-year 2023 outlook for its COVID products – Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Clarity on the underlying vaccination and treatment rates will be observed by year end and will set a reliable base for the prediction of future product utilization.As previously announced, the European Union (EU) contract for Comirnaty supply was renegotiated with amended purchasing obligations through 2026. The U.S. market for Comirnaty transitioned to commercially available product in September 2023. Due to the recent commencement of the fall vaccination period, the outlook for year-end vaccination rates and market shares requires more time for more determinable estimates.As previously announced, Paxlovid also received full NDA approval from the FDA earlier this year. The global utilization rates for Paxlovid are currently trending slightly above last year’s utilization but lower than our original expectations.Launches Cost Realignment ProgramIn addition, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Pfizer announced that the company has launched a multi-year, enterprise-wide cost realignment program that will realign its costs with its longer-term revenue expectations. The program is expected to deliver targeted savings of at least $3.5 billion, of which $1.0 billion is expected to be realized in 2023 and an additional $2.5 billion is expected to be realized in 2024. The one-time costs to achieve the savings associated with the new cost realignment program are expected to be approximately $3.0 billion, of which the majority is expected to be cash. These costs will primarily include severance and implementation costs. Pfizer will continue to refine the estimated targeted savings and their associated costs over the remainder of the year and will incorporate them into its full-year guidance for 2024.Updates Full-Year 2023 Revenue and Adjusted(2) Diluted EPS Guidance(1) RangesPfizer also announced that it now anticipates full-year 2023 revenues to be in the range of $58.0 to $61.0 billion, versus its previous guidance range of $67.0 to $70.0 billion solely due to its COVID products. Full-year 2023 revenues for Paxlovid and Comirnaty are expected to be approximately $12.5 billion, a decline of $9.0 billion versus original expectations. The company is reducing its full-year 2023 revenue expectations for Paxlovid by approximately $7.0 billion which includes a non-cash $4.2 billion revenue reversal for the return of the 7.9 million treatment courses of EUA-labeled U.S. government inventory, as well as the delayed commercialization to January 2024 versus our previous expectation of commercialization in the second half of 2023. The company is also reducing its full-year 2023 revenue expectations for Comirnaty by approximately $2.0 billion due to lower-than-expected vaccination rates.Pfizer’s non-COVID products remain on track to achieve an expected 6% to 8% operational revenue growth year over year in 2023.Due to lower-than-expected utilization for our COVID products, Pfizer recorded a non-cash charge of $5.5 billion to Cost of Goods Sold in the third quarter of 2023 primarily related to inventory write-offs for Paxlovid of $4.6 billion and to a lesser extent for inventory write-offs and other charges for Comirnaty of $0.9 billion.The company expects to deliver approximately $1.0 billion in savings in 2023 through its cost realignment program.Revised guidance also reflects anticipated improvement in our Effective Tax Rate on Adjusted(2) Income for 2023 from approximately 15% in our original guidance to approximately 12%.Due to the aforementioned items, the company now expects full-year 2023 Adjusted(2) diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.65 versus its original guidance range of $3.25 to $3.45.The Company’s updated Revenues and Adjusted(2) diluted EPS guidance(1) is presented below.2023Previous Guidance(1) (August 1, 2023)One-TimeItems(a)All OtherAdjustments(b)2023Revised Guidance(1)Revenues*$67.0 to $70.0 billion-$(4.2) billion~$(4.8) billion$58.0 to $61.0 billionNon-cash Inventory Write-offs(a)$5.5 billionAdjusted(2) Diluted EPS*$3.25 to $3.45$(1.46)$(0.34)$1.45 to $1.65(a) One-time items include approximately $4.2 billion of a non-cash revenue reversal related to the return of an estimated 7.9 treatment courses of U.S. government EUA-labeled Paxlovid and a non-cash $5.5 billion inventory write-off of COVID products.(b) All other adjustments include approximately $4.8 billion reduction in COVID product revenue due to the delayed commercialization of Paxlovid to January 2024 versus our previous expectation of commercialization in second half of 2023 as well as lower-than-expected vaccination rates for Comirnaty partially offset by $1.0 billion in anticipated savings from the cost realignment program.* Changes in foreign exchange rates have had a minimal incremental impact since full-year 2023 guidance was issued. Please refer to Press Release Footnote (1) for additional information.Executive CommentaryDr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: ""Pfizer’s non-COVID product portfolio remains strong, and we continue to expect these products to achieve year-over-year operational revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% in 2023.""At the same time, this agreement with the U.S. government makes it easier for patients to access Paxlovid; enables the United States to have a robust stockpile for future use; and provides Pfizer with greater clarity regarding the transition to a commercial market for this important treatment, which has helped remove some of the uncertainty around our business expectations for our COVID products. We expect additional clarification on global vaccination and treatment rates by the end of the year, which we expect will be a good predictor of utilization in future years.""We remain proud that our scientific breakthroughs played a significant role in getting the global health crisis under control. Over the past several years, we have continued to ensure supply readiness for our COVID products, and as we gain additional clarity around vaccination and treatment rates for COVID, we will be better able to estimate the appropriate level of supply to meet demand and continue to address any ongoing public health needs. As a result, we continue to expect our COVID-related revenues to contribute to our business in future periods, helping us to further invest in activities that drive Pfizer’s long-term growth potential.""Pfizer intends to provide additional commentary and all components of its updated full-year 2023 guidance in its Third-Quarter 2023 Performance Report to be issued on Tuesday, October 31, 2023.Investor Call DetailsPfizer Inc. invites investors and the general public to view and listen to a webcast of a live conference call with investment analysts at 8 a.m. EDT on Monday, October 16, 2023.To view and listen to the webcast visit Pfizer’s web site at www.pfizer.com/investors.

The emergency use of PAXLOVID is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWARNING: SIGNIFICANT DRUG INTERACTIONS WITH PAXLOVIDPAXLOVID includes ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, which may lead to greater exposure of certain concomitant medications, resulting in potentially severe, life-threatening, or fatal eventsPrior to prescribing PAXLOVID: 1) Review all medications taken by the patient to assess potential drug-drug interactions with a strong CYP3A inhibitor like PAXLOVID and 2) Determine if concomitant medications require a dose adjustment, interruption, and/or additional monitoringConsider the benefit of PAXLOVID treatment in reducing hospitalization and death, and whether the risk of potential drug-drug interactions for an individual patient can be appropriately managedPAXLOVID is contraindicated in patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions (eg, toxic epidermal necrolysis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to its active ingredients (nirmatrelvir or ritonavir) or any other components of the product. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue PAXLOVID and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.PAXLOVID is contraindicated with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions and drugs that are strong CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced nirmatrelvir or ritonavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance. There are certain other drugs for which concomitant use with PAXLOVID should be avoided and/or dose adjustment, interruption, or therapeutic monitoring is recommended. Drugs listed here are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all drugs that may be contraindicated with PAXLOVID. The healthcare provider should consult other appropriate resources such as the prescribing information for the interacting drug for comprehensive information on dosing or monitoring with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor like PAXLOVID.Drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions:Alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist: alfuzosinAntianginal: ranolazineAntiarrhythmic: amiodarone, dronedarone, flecainide, propafenone, quinidineAnti-gout: colchicine (in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment)Antipsychotics: lurasidone, pimozideBenign prostatic hyperplasia agents: silodosinCardiovascular agents: eplerenone, ivabradineErgot derivatives: dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergonovineHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: lovastatin, simvastatin (these drugs can be temporarily discontinued to allow PAXLOVID use)Immunosuppressants: voclosporinMicrosomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor: lomitapideMigraine medications: eletriptan, ubrogepantMineralocorticoid receptor antagonists: finerenoneOpioid antagonists: naloxegolPDE5 inhibitor: sildenafil (Revatio®) when used for pulmonary arterial hypertensionSedative/hypnotics: triazolam, oral midazolamSerotonin receptor 1A agonist/serotonin receptor 2A antagonist: flibanserinVasopressin receptor antagonists: tolvaptanDrugs that are strong CYP3A inducers: PAXLOVID cannot be started immediately after discontinuation of any of the following medications due to the delayed offset of the recently discontinued CYP3A inducer:Anticancer drugs: apalutamideAnticonvulsant: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoinAntimycobacterials: rifampin, rifapentineCystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator potentiators: lumacaftor/ivacaftorHerbal Products: St. John’s Wort (hypericum perforatum)Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions: Initiation of PAXLOVID, which contains ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving PAXLOVID, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Medications that induce CYP3A may decrease concentrations of PAXLOVID. These interactions may lead to:Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medicationsLoss of therapeutic effect of PAXLOVID and possible development of viral resistanceSevere, life-threatening, and/or fatal adverse reactions due to drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with PAXLOVID. The most commonly reported concomitant medications resulting in serious adverse reactions were calcineurin inhibitors (eg, tacrolimus, cyclosporine), followed by calcium channel blockers.Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic transaminase elevations, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering PAXLOVID to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, or hepatitis. Because nirmatrelvir is coadministered with ritonavir, there may be a risk ofHIV-1 developing resistance to HIV protease inhibitors in individuals with uncontrolled or undiagnosed HIV-1 infection.The most common adverse reactions in the PAXLOVID group (≥1%) that occurred at a greater frequency than in the placebo group were dysgeusia (5% and &lt;1%, respectively) and diarrhea (3% and 2%, respectively).The following adverse reactions have been identified during use of PAXLOVID under Emergency Use Authorization:Immune System Disorders: Anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactionsSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndromeNervous System Disorders: HeadacheVascular Disorders: HypertensionGastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomitingGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: MalaisePAXLOVID is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, and an inhibitor of CYP2D6, P-gp, and OATP1B1. Coadministration of PAXLOVID with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2D6 or are transported by P-gp or OATP1B1 may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs and increase the risk of adverse events. Coadministration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring.Pregnancy: Available data on the use of nirmatrelvir during pregnancy are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Published observational studies on ritonavir use in pregnant women have not identified an increase in the risk of major birth defects. Published studies with ritonavir are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk of miscarriage. There are maternal and fetal risks associated with untreated COVID-19 in pregnancy.Lactation: There are no available data on the presence of nirmatrelvir in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. A transient decrease in body weight was observed in the nursing offspring of rats administered nirmatrelvir. Limited published data report that ritonavir is present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of ritonavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PAXLOVID and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PAXLOVID or from the underlying maternal condition.Contraception: Use of ritonavir may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives. Advise patients using combined hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of contraception.Pediatrics: The optimal dose of PAXLOVID has not been established in pediatric patients.Systemic exposure of nirmatrelvir increases in renally impaired patients with increase in the severity of renal impairment. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment. Reduce the dose of PAXLOVIDin patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 to &lt;60 mL/min). PAXLOVID is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt;30 mL/min) or in patients with end-stage renal disease (eGFR &lt;15 mL/min).PAXLOVID is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).Please see Full Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNING and Patient InformationClick for Fact Sheets:For Consumers:EUA Fact sheet for Patients, Parents, and CaregiversFor Healthcare Professionals:EUA Fact Sheet for HCPsINDICATION, AUTHORIZED USE AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR COMIRNATYINDICATIONCOMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) is a vaccine approved for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 12 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONYou should NOT receive COMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) if you have had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of COMIRNATY or a previous dose of a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccineThere is a remote chance that COMIRNATY could cause a severe allergic reaction.

In the study, PHAROS met its primary endpoint of objective response rate.Following the label expansion, the Braftovi/Mektovi combination is approved for two indications in the United States. The combination is already approved for treating adult patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutated metastatic melanoma. Braftovi, in combination with cetuximab, is also approved to treat adult patients with BRAF V600E-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer.Per management estimates, NSCLC accounts for nearly 80-85% of all lung cancer cases. A BRAF V600E mutation occurs in around 2% of all NSCLC cases. To counter such specific types of cancers, personalized therapies like Braftovi + Mektovi are required, which can address a genetically changed NSCLC indication.Shares of Pfizer have lost 35.8% so far this year against the industry’s 8.5% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBraftovi and Mektovi were added to Pfizer’s oncology portfolio with the acquisition of Array Biopharma in 2019.Pfizer has the largest number of new product and indication launches planned for 2023, most of which are expected to occur in the second half of the year. Pfizer is more than halfway to its goal of launching 19 new products or indications in 18 months (all non-COVID indications), which are expected to generate around $20 billion in sales by 2030. Two-thirds of these products have blockbuster potential, according to Pfizer.Pfizer RSV vaccine, Abrysvo, was approved to help protect older adults, as well as infants (through maternal immunization) in the United States in 2023. In August, the FDA approved Elrexfio, a BCMA-CD3-targeted bispecific antibody for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. In June, the FDA approved Litfulo, its JAK3 inhibitor for treating severe alopecia areata and Ngenla, a long-acting once-weekly pediatric growth hormone deficiency treatment. In March, the agency approved the company’s migraine nasal spray, Zavzpret, for use in adults.Story continuesThese approvals will likely boost the company’s top line, which has been suffering a plunge due to a fall in demand for COVID-19 products.Pfizer Inc.

The FDA approved Pfizer’s PFE Braftovi + Mektovi combination for a lung cancer indication. Novo Nordisk NVO announced plans to stop a kidney outcomes study on Ozempic earlier than planned for efficacy. J&amp;J JNJ and Merck MRK provided pipeline and regulatory updates on their cancer drugs.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesLilly’s CD Study on Mirikizumab Meets Goals: Lilly’s phase III study (VIVID-1) evaluating its pipeline candidate, mirikizumab, for treating moderately to severely active CD, achieved the co-primary endpoints and all major secondary endpoints versus placebo. Data from the study showed that 45.4% of patients in the mirikizumab arm achieved clinical response at Week 12 and clinical remission at Week 52, statistically higher than 19.6% for placebo.For the other primary endpoint, 38.0% of patients in the mirikizumab arm achieved clinical response at Week 12 and endoscopic response at Week 52, statistically higher than 19.6% for placebo. Overall, in the study, mirikizumab demonstrated clinical remission and endoscopic response in CD patients over the long term. Based on data from the study, Lilly plans to file regulatory applications seeking approval of mirikizumab for the CD indication in 2024.A biologic license application (“BLA”) seeking approval of mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis (“UC”) is under review with the FDA. In April, the FDA issued a complete response letter to the BLA. The FDA did not mention any concerns related to the clinical data package, safety, or label of the drug. It rather raised issues related to the proposed manufacturing of mirikizumab. The drug is already available as Omvoh in Japan and the EU for the UC indication.FDA Approves Pfizer’s Braftovi + Mektovi in NSCLC Indication: The FDA approved Pfizer’s cancer drugs Braftovi + Mektovi for BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). At present, Braftovi + Mektovi is approved for BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma, while Braftovi, as a monotherapy, is approved for BRAF-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer.Story continuesThe FDA approval for the BRAF V600E-mutant NSCLC indication was based on data from the PHAROS study, which showed that patients with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic NSCLC could benefit from Braftovi + Mektovi targeted therapy regardless of their prior treatment history.Novo Nordisk’s Kidney Outcomes Study on Ozempic Stopped Early for Efficacy: An independent data monitoring committee recommended that a kidney outcomes study evaluating once-weekly injectable Ozempic be stopped earlier than planned based on an interim analysis. The data from the interim analysis showed that certain pre-specified criteria for stopping the study early for efficacy were met.Once-weekly subcutaneous Ozempic is currently approved in the United States in 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg doses for the treatment of type II diabetes as well as for reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type II diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. The company’s FLOW study is evaluating the efficacy of Ozempic for the prevention of the progression of renal impairment in people with type II diabetes and chronic kidney disease compared to placebo.J&amp;J Seeks EU Approval for Expanded Use of Rybrevant: J&amp;J filed a Type II indication application extension to the European Medicines Agency seeking expanded approval for its cancer drug, Rybrevant (amivantamab). The application, which is based on data from the phase III PAPILLON study, seeks approval of Rybrevant in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and pemetrexed) for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. A supplemental biologics license application seeking approval from the FDA for a similar first-line use of Rybrevant in NSCLC is also under review in the United States.Rybrevant is presently approved in the United States and Europe for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy.Merck’s Keytruda Early-Stage NSCLC Study Meets Overall Survival Goal: Merck’s pivotal phase III study, KEYNOTE-671, evaluating Keytruda as a perioperative treatment regimen for patients with resectable stage II, IIIA or IIIB NSCLC met its second of the dual primary endpoint of overall survival.In the study, Keytruda showed a statistically significant overall survival benefitfor patients with stage II, IIIA or IIIB NSCLC.  In a pivotal study, Keytruda was given in combination with chemotherapy before surgery (neoadjuvant), followed by resection and Keytruda as monotherapy after surgery (adjuvant).Data from this new interim analysis of the study demonstrated that the Keytruda-based regimen led to a statistically significant improvement in overall survival versus pre-operative chemotherapy. We remind investors that in March KEYNOTE-671 had met the first of its dual primary endpoints, event-free survival, as well as key secondary endpoints of pathological complete response and major pathological response.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index rose 3.82% in the last five trading sessions.Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnHere’s how the eight major stocks performed in the last five trading sessions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the last five trading sessions, while Lilly rose the most (12.9%), Pfizer declined the most (1.5%).In the past six months, Lilly has risen the most (63%), while Pfizer has declined the most (20%).(See the last pharma stock roundup here:LLY Offers to Buy POINT Biopharma &amp; Other Updates.)What's Next in the Pharma World?Watch out for J&amp;J's Q3 earnings and regular pipeline and regulatory updates next week.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

I talked recently with Steve Bisgay, the new CFO at Clear Street, an independent prime broker valued at $2 billion, that wants to replace decades-old infrastructure across capital markets. To do so, the startup built a cloud-native prime brokerage and clearing system from scratch to provide real-time data to make quicker decisions.Along with Clear Street, two tech giants—IBM and Microsoft—may throw their hats in the ring to give Wall Street an upgrade. “Can AI fix Wall Street’s ‘spaghetti code’ crisis? Microsoft and IBM are betting that it can,” is a new Fortune feature by Ben Weiss that delves into the Cobol calamity.As Cobol gets older, it's been challenging for Wall Street to find people who can update their legacy systems. “When something does go wrong, many firms turn to 82-year-old Bill Hinshaw, the ‘Cobol Cowboy,’” Weiss writes. “Hinshaw works out of his home office in northern Texas, where he oversees a remote team of some 600 aging Cobol engineers—some of whom cut their teeth as programmers in the ‘60s and ‘70s. Every week, the cowboys respond to emergency calls—including one in 2021 from Superior Welding Supply, a 93-year-old Iowa firm whose only in-house Cobol expert died just before the company’s software crashed.”But government agencies and large banks have actually raised alarm over their aging technical infrastructure, according to Weiss. “The vast majority of major banks, when you get down to the actual core banking systems, you get down to Cobol,” Michael Abbott, the global banking lead at Accenture, told him.Ruchir Puri, chief scientist at IBM Research, told Weiss that “through generative AI, or the same technology that powers OpenAI’s ChatGPT, IBM can turn poorly documented Cobol into structured, easy-to-parse Java,” he writes.Story continuesAnd, according to Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of GitHub, the Microsoft-owned software platform for developers, its generative AI–powered assistant, GitHub Copilot, can help modernize the legacy infrastructure.You can read more here about Weiss’s deep dive into the history of Cobol—and how generative AI may be riding to the rescue.Have a good weekend.Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comUpcoming event: Fortune‘s Emerging CFO virtual event, in partnership with Workday, “Finance and IT as co-innovation partners,” will take place on Oct. 25, 11 a.m.-12 p.m. ET.Join us for a conversation where we will explore strategies to shift the Finance-IT relationship from its traditional support model to a partnership focused on co-innovation, from breaking down data silos to improving cross-functional skills. Confirmed speakers will include: Eric Kutcher, CFO, McKinsey &amp; Company; Zane Rowe, CFO, Workday; and Sindy Wilson, CFO, Kickstarter.Click here for more information and to register.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

The company is expected to deliver sales and earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.71 per share, indicating an 8.9% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. For fiscal first-quarter revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $21.64 billion, suggesting a 5% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.In the last reported quarter, the company recorded an earnings surprise of 3.8%. It has delivered a bottom-line beat of 2.4%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Procter &amp; Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise Procter &amp; Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS SurpriseProcter &amp; Gamble Company (The) price-eps-surprise | Procter &amp; Gamble Company (The) QuoteKey Factors to NoteProcter &amp; Gamble has been demonstrating its dominance in the global market by strategically leveraging its brand strength to drive organic sales growth. As a manufacturer of products catering to the essential daily needs of consumers worldwide, P&amp;G's success in the preceding quarters can be attributed to its robust brand portfolio and effective business strategies. The persistence of these trends is expected to get reflected in the company’s organic sales for the fiscal first quarter.We expect organic sales to increase 5.3% in the to-be-reported quarter. Organic sales are expected to increase 9% for the Beauty segment, 2% for Grooming, 2% for Fabric &amp; Home Care, 4% for Health Care, and 9% for the Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segment.P&amp;G has been diligently pursuing cost-saving and productivity measures to drive margins and reinforce its competitive advantage. The company's commitment to enhancing productivity while mitigating macro cost headwinds has been integral to maintaining a balanced top and bottom-line growth. Its focus on productivity and cost-saving plans are likely to have boosted margins in the to-be-reported quarter.We expect P&amp;G's core gross margin for the fiscal first quarter to have been influenced by significant productivity savings. Our model predicts a core gross margin expansion of 100 bps for the to-be-reported quarter. However, currency headwinds are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Rising input costs are expected to have partly weighed on the fiscal first-quarter performance. Additionally, Procter &amp; Gamble has been witnessing elevated SG&amp;A expenses due to higher supply-chain costs, rising inflation and elevated transportation expenses.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management pointed out that the ongoing supply-chain issues, higher transportation costs, geopolitical challenges, currency headwinds and rising inflation might continue to impact consumer confidence throughout fiscal 2024. The persistence of these headwinds is likely to get reflected in the company’s bottom-line performance to some extent.Our estimate indicates a 1% impact from currency headwinds in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Meanwhile, our estimate for core SG&amp;A expenses of $5.1 billion indicates a year-over-year rise of 6.3%. As a percentage of sales, core SG&amp;A expenses are estimated to reflect a 50-bps expansion from the year-ago quarter. Consequently, our model suggests a 50-bps operating margin expansion to 24.5% in the fiscal first quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Procter &amp; Gamble this time around.

148,7915cef9-a05e-3971-93e3-b0be27148100,TAP,2023-10-14,5 Alcohol Industry Stocks Poised to Counter Adverse Trends,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-alcohol-industry-stocks-poised-125900171.html,1697201940,STORY,"['BUD', 'SAM', 'TAP-A', 'BF-B', '^GSPC', 'STZ']","[Players in the Zacks Beverages – Alcohol industry have been witnessing higher commodity and logistics costs due to escalated input and packaging costs. Additionally, the industry participants have been keen on spending on advertising and marketing, which has resulted in higher operational costs. These elevated costs are likely to persist and may hurt the margins of alcohol makers. However, companies in the alcohol space are placed to benefit from the continued recovery across markets and channels, robust demand for premium and high-quality products, and innovative spirits. The diversification of product portfolios of alcohol companies has been helping boost their top lines. Companies are expected to benefit from the momentum in spirits and ready-to-drink (RTD) cocktails.Investments in product innovations, premiumization and technology platforms bode well for players like AnheuserBusch InBev BUD, Constellation Brands Inc. STZ, Brown-Forman (BF.B), Molson Coors TAP and The Boston Beer Company Inc. SAM.About the IndustryThe Zacks Beverages – Alcohol industry mainly comprises producers, importers, exporters, marketers and sellers of alcoholic beverages like beer, craft beer, ciders, wine, rum, whiskey, liqueurs, vodka, tequila, champagnes, brandy, amaretto, RTD cocktails and malt. Some industry players also produce and sell non-alcoholic beverages like carbonated soft drinks, sparkling waters, bottled water, energy drinks, powdered and natural juices, and RTD teas. The companies sell products through wholesalers and retailers like supermarkets, warehouse clubs, grocery stores, convenience stores, package stores, drug stores and other retail outlets. The industry participants also sell beer directly to consumers in cans and bottles at restaurants, pubs, bars and liquor stores. Some brewers operate brewpubs or taste rooms at breweries, offering consumers the freshest beer.What's Shaping the Future of Beverages - Alcohol IndustryElevated Costs: Players in the alcohol industry have been enduring pressures from the ongoing impacts of inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. The industry players have been experiencing elevated ingredient and other input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees, and secondary packaging materials, leading to increased costs of sales and higher operating costs. These have been resulting in adverse gross and operating margins for beverage companies.Apart from elevated input and packaging costs, players in the alcohol industry are anticipated to witness higher advertising and promotional expenses, as well as SG&amp;A costs, further threatening profitability. Rising brand investments, particularly in media, advertising, production and local marketing, and increased freight to distributors due to higher volumes are resulting in elevated advertising, promotional and selling expenses. Growing external costs, increased compensation expenses and higher discretionary spending are expected to drive SG&amp;A deleverage. Most industry players expect the trend to continue in the near term, impacting profitability to some extent.Premiumization &amp; Product Diversification: Premiumization has been a key growth driver for players in the alcohol space due to consumers’ continued desires for refreshing and newer tastes. Many beverage companies are diversifying their product offerings to capture more sales. Alcohol companies have also been witnessing robust demand trends for premium and high-end products. As a result, the companies focused on innovation and portfolio premiumization stand to gain from today’s market. Players have been exploring opportunities beyond the traditional beer, whiskey, spirits and wine categories. Some popular variations that have gained traction include RTD spirits like canned wine and cocktails, hard seltzers, cider, and flavored malt beverages. To capitalize on the priority and consumer trends, companies have been resorting to innovative products. Notably, RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing alcohol segment. Many companies in the industry have collaborated to grow their shares in the fast-growing RTD category.E-Commerce Development &amp; Pricing Gains: Alcohol companies have been benefiting from the rise of e-commerce, and the recovery across markets and channels, boosting volume. Investments in online and e-commerce portals have gained prominence. Companies have been investing in the latest capabilities, and leveraging technology to better connect with customers and consumers. With a recovery in markets and channels, and the expansion of digital capabilities, players in the alcohol space look well-poised for growth. Additionally, companies have been benefiting from price increases and supply productivity savings, offsetting the effects of cost inflation. Effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution have been boosting sales of alcohol companies.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Beverages – Alcohol industry is a 17-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #216. The rank places it at the bottom 14% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. In the past year, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have declined 2.2%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Underperforms S&amp;P 500The Zacks Beverages – Alcohol industry has outperformed the broader sector and underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the past year.The stocks in the industry have collectively gained 1% and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has rallied 22.6%, while the Zacks Consumer Staples sector has declined 3.4%.One-Year Price PerformanceBeverages - Alcohol Industry's ValuationBased on the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, commonly used for valuing Consumer Staples stocks, the industry is currently trading at 17.74X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 18.7X and the sector’s 16.09X.Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 22.28X, as low as 17.74X and at the median of 20.49X, as the chart below shows.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (Past 5 Years)5 Alcohol Beverages Stocks to Keep a Close Eye onOne stock in the Zacks Beverages – Alcohol space currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and another stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Detroit's Big Three are rapidly changing their vehicle lineups. But it hasn't always been a smooth ride, as General Motors (GM), Ford (F), and Stellantis (STLA) are deadlocked with the United Auto Workers (UAW) over the future of manufacturing amid this transition. Yahoo Finance spoke to experts across the industry to give investors an inside look at the state of the EV industry as part of the weekly series ""EVs: The Road Ahead.""EV prices dropped for many manufacturers, including Tesla (TSLA), in Q3. Cox Automotive Director of Industry Insights Stephanie Valdez-Streaty remains positive regarding EV pricing. Valdez-Streaty said, ""Consumer sentiment is changing in terms of affordability, so I think that's really going to help.""Craig Irwin, ROTH Capital Partners Senior Research Analyst, and Ronald Jewsikow, Guggenheim Securities Vice President – Automotive Equity Research, broke down the investments in EVs and why demand remains low.Irwin explained, ""To build the EV charging infrastructure out there, we probably need another $10-20 billion on top of the $7.5 (billion) that's been set aside.""Jewsikow added some insight with regard to the EV truck market. He said, ""What we've seen so far, at least with the early entrants into the EV pickup market, there's been a strong preference for the gasoline-powered options.""Blink Charging (BLNK) President and CEO Brendan Jones and Plug In America Executive Director Joel Levin discussed the most important challenges behind the EV charging infrastructure.Jones believes that consumers need to break the trend of fueling at a station rather than using reliable home chargers. He explained, ""We have to break the dominant paradigm of charging by saying, you don't have to go to a depot or fuel station.""Levin believes that there needs to be more effort put into the installation of EV charging stations at apartment complexes. He said, ""It's not a simple problem. It's probably the single most challenging problem we have in the EV space.""Story continuesAccording to a poll from Ipsos and Yahoo Finance, 57 percent of respondents answered that they are not likely to purchase an electric vehicle as their next car. Yahoo Finance Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian believes that ""education is key"" to the adoption of EVs ""if the country is going to see the Biden administration's 50 percent mandate of EVs by 2030.""Christine Tezak, ClearView Energy Partners, LLC Managing Director of Research, detailed the challenges of the grid and why it could hold back the EV infrastructure rollout.

This as Tesla’s lead at the top is narrowing.According to automotive research firm Kelley Blue Book (KBB), US EV sales in the third quarter crossed 313,000, nearly a 50% increase from a year ago, and around 15,000 more than the 298,000 sold in Q2. Cox Automotive (KBB's parent company) said EV market share hit 7.9%, its highest ever level and up from the 6.1% recorded a year ago.""Higher inventory levels, more product availability, and downward pricing pressure have helped spur continued linear growth of EV sales in the US market,"" said Jonathan Smoke, Cox Automotive's chief economist.Three years ago, total EV sales for the year passed 250,000, and KBB says this year EV sales are on pace to top 1 million. KBB also noted 14 new EV models were now in the mix, and automakers like Volvo, Nissan, Mercedes, and Hyundai saw EV sales gains of over 200%, though at limited quantities.Of course the 800-pound gorilla in the room is Tesla, which sold over 150,000 EVs in the US, exactly half (50%) of the total amount sold. While a huge amount, Tesla’s share of the pie has been shrinking lately, with 50% its lowest level on record, and down from 62% a year ago.Though Tesla’s market share is slipping, its overall sales volume is increasing — up 19.5% year over year and beating the industry’s overall growth rate of 16.3%, KBB said.Coinciding with Tesla’s jump in overall sales have been its price cuts, which the company has been implementing aggressively over the past year or so. “In an attempt to increase sales volume, Tesla slashed prices, which are now down roughly 25% year over year. The price cuts have helped,” KBB noted in its report.Ford has also cut prices on its Mustang Mach-E SUV, and Ford Lightning EV pickup; however, big picture in the US at least, EVs are still relatively expensive, and that’s a major concern for consumers. KBB reports that the ATP (average transaction price) of an EV was $50,683, down a considerable amount from the $65,000 a year ago, but still more than gas-powered cars, which can still be had for under $30,000.Story continuesYahoo Finance noted this concern in our EV sentiment poll conducted with Ipsos, which found 70% of respondents were worried about overall cost of EVs, among other concerns.Tesla for its part has been trying to make EVs cheaper, with CEO Elon Musk claiming market share gains were more important than preserving Tesla’s industry best margins, which were once above 20%. That being said, without more sub-$40,000 EVs like Tesla’s Model 3 and the Chevrolet Bolt, the industry might struggle to hit a 10% EV market share, let alone 20% nationally.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Fain said the union will stand up and strike at selected plants at any time, which is what happened on Wednesday when the UAW called members at Ford’s Kentucky Truck Plant to walk off the factory floor. Fain also implored all members of the UAW to join current picketers at stand-up strike locations in an effort to show union strength and mark one month of strikes on Saturday.Fain said the Big Three had come to expect Friday to be a deadline and withheld final offers until Fain gave his weekly address. This needed to change, he said, in order to speed up the process. “This week we entered an entirely new phase of our stand-up strike,” Fain said.A United Auto Workers union member pickets outside Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant after going on strike in Louisville, Ky., Oct. 12, 2023. (Luke Sharrett/REUTERS) (Luke Sharrett / reuters)According to the UAW, for two weeks Ford (F) negotiators had told them there was more money to be had with the offer. On Wednesday, Fain said Ford owed the union an offer, but it received the same economic offer from two weeks ago, with no more money. At that point, Fain said to Ford negotiators in Dearborn, “You just cost yourself Kentucky Truck Plant.”Following the walk-off at Kentucky Truck, Ford held a news conference where president Kumar Galhotra told UAW negotiators the automaker was “at the limit” of what it could offer financially. “Going further will hurt our ability to invest in the business like we need to invest,” Galhotra said.Fain’s rebuttal hit on the union's themes of inequality and fairness. “You know who’s reached their limit? The tens of thousands of workers without retirement benefits,” he said.Currently the UAW strikes have led to nearly 34,000 workers walking off the job across the Big Three’s plants and parts distribution centers. Recent reports of the economic costs of the strike’s impact on the US economy have reached into the billions.Story continuesFain, however, was defiant in the face of those reports. “We strike for four weeks and everyone loses their minds … when working class people stand up and ask for more, it’s a crisis”With the rhetoric heating up on both sides, the UAW strikes against the Big Three are showing no signs of slowing down.“Unless we start to see real gains … I predict there will be a lot more strikes on the horizon,” Fain said.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Tomorrow they're calling on all UAW members to head to current picket lines to mark one month of strikes Fain also said that the companies are waiting until Friday for counteroffers.

The development came two days after a surprise walkout at Ford Motor's biggest and most profitable plant, as the ongoing, coordinated strike against the group that includes General Motors and Stellantis enters its 29th day. Here is a timeline of events beginning with the election of UAW President Shawn Fain in March: Date Development March 25 Shawn Fain wins the race for UAW president; vows to take a tough stance against the Big Three automakers. July 10 The union says it will open contract talks with Detroit's Big Three automakers starting July 13. July 11 Fain says the union is not afraid to hold a strike at any of the automakers without a fair contract. July 19 Fain meets President Joe Biden at the White House as the union briefed the staff on contract talks with the automakers. Aug. 1 The UAW presents demands to Stellantis, says the union is seeking ambitious benefit increases from the Detroit Three, including double-digit pay rises and defined-benefit pensions for all workers. Aug. 2 The union presents contract demands to General Motors. Aug. 3 The union presents contract demands to Ford Aug. 8 Fain angrily tosses contract proposals from Stellantis in a trash can, citing numerous concessions that the Chrysler parent is seeking in labor talks. Aug. 25 The UAW says 97% of voting members were in favor of authorizing a strike at the Detroit Three if an agreement is not reached before Sept. 14. Aug. 31 The union says it has filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against GM and Stellantis, saying they have refused to bargain in good faith. Aug. 31 Ford makes a contract offer to the UAW, providing hourly employees with 15% guaranteed combined wage increases, lumpsum payments and improved benefits over the life of the contract. Sept. 1 The NLRB says it will investigate the charges filed by the UAW. Sept 6 The UAW makes a labor contract counterproposal on economic issues to Ford. Sept. 7 GM makes counteroffer to the UAW that includes a 10% wage hike and two additional 3% annual lumpsum payments over four years. Fain calls the offer ""insulting."" Sept. 8 Stellantis says it offered U.S. hourly workers a 14.5% wage hike over four years but no lumpsum payments. Sept. 8 Fain says UAW expects to go on strike against all three automakers the following week if they do not improve their contract offers. Sept. 11 Stellantis says it plans to make a new counteroffer to the UAW after the union made its own revised offer on Sunday ahead of the expiration of the current four-year labor deal Thursday night. Sept. 13 The UAW rejects counteroffers from the automakers and outlined plans for strikes targeting individual U.S. auto plants in what would be its first-ever simultaneous strike against the Detroit Three. Sept. 15 The UAW launches simultaneous strikes that will halt production of some popular models at three factories owned by GM, Ford and Stellantis. Sept. 16 Negotiators for the UAW and Ford had ""reasonably productive discussions"" toward a new contract, while officials at Stellantis said a proposal to resume work at an idled Illinois factory has fallen through. Sept. 18 UAW says it would announce on Sept. 22 more plants to strike at if no serious progress is made in talks. Sept. 20 UAW says 90 workers went on strike at Mercedes-supplier ZF's plant in Alabama. Sept. 22 UAW will expand its strikes against GM and Stellantis, but has made real progress in talks with Ford Motor, the union says. Sept 24. Ford says despite progress in some areas, it still has ""significant gaps to close"" on key economic issues before it can reach a new labor agreement with UAW. Sept. 28 The UAW makes a new counter-proposal to Stellantis, just one day before it was set to strike at additional Detroit Three facilities. Sept. 29 The UAW will walk off the job at an additional plant at General Motors and at Ford, said Fain. The new strike will not extend to Stellantis, which called before the scheduled 10 a.m. ET announcement to make significant changes in its contract proposal. Oct.2 GM and Ford say they are laying off another 500 workers at four Midwestern plants. Separately, the UAW confirms it presented a new contract offer to GM. GM says it has received the counterproposal ""but significant gaps remain."" Oct. 3 Ford said it had made a new contract offer but said a dispute over battery plants remained unresolved. Ford said the new offer boosted wages for temporary workers, increased company 401(k) contributions and had further shrunk time needed to get to the top wage rate. Oct. 6 The UAW held off on additional strikes against Detroit Three auto plants, citing GM's unexpected willingness to allow workers at joint-venture battery plants to be covered by union contracts. Oct. 11 GM, Ford and Stellantis all agreed to raise base wages by between 20% and 23% over a four-year deal. Ford and Stellantis agreed to reinstate cost-of-living adjustments, or COLA. Oct. 12 The UAW shut down Ford's biggest plant globally, saying the automaker refused to move further in bargaining. UAW negotiators are expected to turn their attention to talks with Stellantis. Oct. 13 Fain says the union will not expand its strike at the moment, but warned that members would now walk out of additional facilities without warning rather than wait until Fridays to announce new plans.

GillWell, good morning, and welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. I am Bryan Gill, the Director of Investor Relations for PNC and participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of October 13, 2023, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.William S. DemchakThank you, Bryan. And good morning, everyone. As you can see on the slide, we delivered strong results in the third quarter, generating $1.6 billion in net income or $3.60 in diluted earnings per share. Rob is going to take you through the numbers in a moment, but I'd like to touch on a few highlights. First, in the challenging operating environment, we generated 3 points of positive operating leverage through disciplined expense management. Our credit quality remained strong during the quarter, reflecting our thoughtful approach to managing risk, customer selection and long-term relationship development, all of which have historically served us well in challenging economic cycles. Next, we strengthened our capital and liquidity positions even further during the quarter. While we continue to monitor discussions regarding regulatory changes in these areas based on our current estimates, we are well positioned to meet the proposed requirements without meaningful changes to how we operate. We continue to execute on our key strategic priorities, including our expansion market efforts and upgrading our digital capabilities and we leveraged our strong balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities such as the signature bank loans that we recently acquired. Finally, we are focused on expense management, particularly in the current environment and have taken actions to maintain disciplined expense control. We increased our continuous improvement goal last quarter from $400 million to $450 million, and we are on track to achieve that goal in 2023. Looking ahead, we expect to have CIP savings within a similar range for 2024. And as a reminder, we used savings from this program to fund investments in key growth markets and technology. In addition, earlier this month, we began executing on staff reductions, which will reduce our 2024 expenses by $325 million and will fall to the bottom line. All told, we are implementing more than $725 million of expense management actions that will have impact on 2024. While decisions involving personnel are never easy, we believe they will help us more effectively and efficiently deliver for our customers and our stakeholders, and we'll continue to be diligent in our expense management going forward. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.Story continuesRobert Q. ReillyThanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis and comparing to the second quarter. Loans were down 2% and averaged $320 billion. Investment securities declined $1 billion or 1%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve increased $7 billion to $38 billion. Deposits of $423 billion declined $3 billion or 1%. Borrowed funds increased $2 billion primarily due to senior debt issuances near the end of the second quarter. At quarter end, AOCI was a negative $10.3 billion compared to a negative $9.5 billion at June 30, reflecting higher interest rates. However, tangible book value increased to $78.16 per common share as retained earnings growth exceeded the negative impact of AOCI. Common dividends in the quarter totaled approximately $600 million. And we remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.8% as of September 30, 2023, which increased 30 basis points linked quarter. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Third quarter loans averaged $320 billion and increased $6.5 billion or 2% compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Compared to the second quarter, average loan balances declined 2% as growth in consumer was more than offset by a decline in commercial. Consumer loans grew approximately $500 million reflecting higher residential mortgage and credit card balances. Commercial loans averaged $218 billion, a decline of $5.5 billion, driven by lower utilization as well as paydowns outpacing new production. Loan yields increased 18 basis points to 5.75% in the third quarter, predominantly driven by the higher rate environment. Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits decreased $3 billion or 1% due to a decline in consumer deposits that was somewhat offset by a growth in commercial deposits. In regard to mix, consolidated noninterest-bearing deposits were 26% in the third quarter, down slightly from 27% from the second quarter and consistent with our expectations. And we still expect the noninterest-bearing portion of our deposits to stabilize in the mid-20% range. Commercial noninterest-bearing deposits represented 42% of total commercial deposits in the third quarter compared to 45% in the second quarter. And our consumer deposit noninterest-bearing mix remained stable at 10%. Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 2.26% during the third quarter, up from 1.96% in the prior quarter. And as of September 30, our cumulative deposit beta was 41%, which was slightly better than our July expectation. Slide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $140 billion decreased $1 billion or 1% and as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. The securities portfolio yield increased 5 basis points to 2.57%, reflecting new purchase yields of 5.5% and the runoff of lower-yielding securities. As of September 30, the duration of investment securities portfolio was 4.2 years. Our received fixed swaps point into the commercial loan book totaled $35 billion on September 30. The weighted average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased 34 basis points to 2.07% and the duration of the portfolio was 2.4 years as of September 30. Accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by approximately $800 million in the third quarter as a negative impact of higher rates more than offset paydowns and maturities during the quarter. Importantly, as lower rate securities and swaps roll off, we expect our securities yield to continue to increase, resulting in a meaningful improvement to tangible book value from AOCI accretion. Turning to the income statement on Slide 7. For the first 9 months of 2023, revenue grew 5% compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting higher interest rates and business growth. Noninterest expense grew 2% and was well controlled despite a higher FDIC assessment rate and inflationary pressures. As a result, we generated 3% positive operating leverage and PPNR grew 9%. For the third quarter, net income was $1.6 billion or $3.60 per share. Total revenue of $5.2 billion decreased $60 million or 1% compared to the second quarter of 2023. Net interest income declined $92 million or 3%, and our net interest margin was 2.71%, a decline of 8 basis points. Noninterest income increased $32 million or 2% as higher fee income was partially offset by lower other noninterest income. Third quarter expenses decreased $127 million or 4% linked quarter. Provision was $129 million in the third quarter and our effective tax rate was 15.5%, which included a favorable impact of certain tax matters in the third quarter. For the full year, we now expect our tax rate to be approximately 16.5%. Turning to Slide 8. We highlight our revenue trends. Third quarter revenue was down $60 million or 1% compared with the second quarter. Net interest income of $3.4 billion decreased $92 million or 3% as higher yields on interest-earning assets were more than offset by increased funding costs. Fee income was $1.7 billion and increased $67 million or 4% linked quarter. The primary driver of the increase in fee income was residential and commercial mortgage revenue, which was up $103 million, the majority of which were $97 million was related to an increase in the valuation of net mortgage servicing rights. Partially offsetting this, capital markets and advisory revenue decreased $45 million or 21%, driven by lower trading revenue. M&amp;A advisory activity continued to remain softer in the third quarter despite robust pipelines. Going forward, we do expect this activity to increase in the fourth quarter, which is included in our guidance that I will cover in a few minutes. Other noninterest income of $94 million declined $35 million linked quarter driven by lower private equity revenue and included negative Visa fair value adjustments totaling $51 million. As a reminder, at September 30, PNC owned 3.5 million Visa Class B shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately $1.3 billion. Turning to Slide 9. Our third quarter expenses were down $127 million or 4% linked quarter which in part reflected our increased CIP program. And we generated 3% positive operating leverage on both a year-to-date and a linked quarter basis. Importantly, every expense category remained stable or declined compared to the second quarter of 2023. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10 while overall credit quality remains strong across our portfolio, the pressures we anticipated within the commercial real estate office sector have begun to materialize. Nonperforming loans increased $210 million or 11%, linked quarter. The increase was driven by multi-tenant office, CRE, which increased $373 million, but was partially offset by a decline of $163 million in non-CRE NPLs. In regard to the CRE office portfolio, total criticized loans remained essentially flat quarter-over-quarter at 23%. The difference this quarter is the migration of certain multi-tenant office loans to NPL status which is an expected outcome as we work to resolve the occupancy and rate challenges inherent to this portfolio. Ultimately, we expect future losses on this portfolio, and we believe we have reserved against those potential losses accordingly. As of September 30, our reserves on the office portfolio were 8.5% of total office loans and inside of that 12.5% on the multi-tenant portfolio. Naturally, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions, especially in the higher rate environment to ensure they reflect the real-time market conditions and a full update of the portfolio is included in the appendix slides. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion increased $75 million or 6% linked quarter driven by higher consumer loan delinquencies. Net loan charge-offs of $121 million declined $73 million or 38% linked quarter. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 15 basis points in the third quarter. And our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on September 30, essentially stable at June 30. Turning to Slide 11. From a capital perspective, we're well positioned with a CET1 ratio of 9.8% as of September 30. This slide illustrates the impact to our capital levels assuming the Basel III end game proposed rules were effective as of September 30. The inclusion of AOCI reduces our ratio by approximately 190 basis points. And the impact of all other proposed Basel III endgame components are estimated to have an additional negative 40 to 50 basis point impact to our CET1. Taken together, the current Basel III end-game proposal would increase our risk-weighted assets by approximately 3% to 4%. And our estimated fully phased-in expanded risk-based CET1 ratio would be approximately 7.4%, which is above our current requirement of 7%. In light of the fluidity of the capital proposals, our share repurchase activity remains on pause. We'll continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules and may resume share repurchases activity depending on market and economic conditions as well as other factors. In regard to the long-term debt proposal, if the rule was effective at the end of the third quarter, our binding constraint would be the long-term debt to risk-weighted assets ratio at both the holding company and the bank level. We estimate our current shortfall at the holding company (inaudible) bank to be approximately $1 billion and $8 billion, respectively. And we expect to reach compliance at both the consolidated and bank level through our current funding plan as well as the restructuring of existing intercompany debt. We acknowledge and want to emphasize that proposals are still in their comment period and the final rules are subject to change. That being said, we're well positioned to comply with the proposals as drafted. Slide 12 provides more detail on the $16 billion portfolio of capital commitment facilities we acquired from Signature Bridge Bank earlier this month. PNC has been active in the capital commitment business for many years. We believe the acquisition will enhance our broader efforts in the private equity sponsor industry. Signature's origination strategy was similar to PNC's, which is focused on building relationships with large and established fund managers. As such, we expect to retain 75% of the portfolio. This acquisition is financially attractive, given the purchase price of 99% of par and the high credit quality of the portfolio. Importantly, the transaction does not have a material impact to our capital ratios or tangible book value per share. Slide 13 details our focus on controlling expenses. As Bill mentioned, we remain diligent in our expense management efforts, particularly when considering the current revenue environment. Our continuous improvement program has been in place for over a decade. And through this program, we've utilized expense savings to fund our ongoing business growth and technology investments. Over the past 10 years, through CIP, we've identified and completed actions to reinvest $3.7 billion in our company. As you know, we have a 2023 CIP target of $450 million, and we're on track to meet that target. Looking to 2024, even though we've just begun our budgeting process, we do expect a 2024 annual CIP goal of similar magnitude to the 2023 program. Our CIP efforts over the years have allowed us to substantially invest in our company while still delivering low single-digit annual expense growth. However, the current environment poses meaningful pressures necessitating expense control measures beyond our annual CIP program. As a result, we took a hard look at our organizational structure and identified opportunities to operate more efficiently through staff reductions, which we began implementing earlier this month. This initiative will decrease the workforce by 4% and is expected to reduce 2024 expenses by approximately $325 million. Onetime costs associated with this plan are expected to be approximately $150 million and will be incurred during the fourth quarter of 2023. We believe these actions will position PNC for stronger efficiency going forward. As a result, even though our budgeting cycle isn't complete, we have an objective to keep core expenses stable in 2024, which, by definition, would exclude the fourth quarter onetime charges. In summary, PNC reported a solid third quarter 2023. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we're expecting a mild recession starting in the first half of 2024, with a contraction in real GDP of less than 1%. We expect the federal funds rate to remain unchanged in the near term between 5.25% and 5.5% through mid-2024 when we expect the Fed to begin cutting rates. Looking ahead, our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2023 is as follows: we expect average loans to be up approximately 3%, including the acquisition of the Signature Bank capital commitment facilities; net interest income to be down 1% to 2%; fee income to be up approximately 1% as increased capital markets activity is expected to more than offset the impact of the elevated MSR hedge gains during the third quarter. Other noninterest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. We expect total core noninterest expense to be up 3% to 4%, which excludes charges related to the workforce reduction. Additionally, this guidance does not contemplate the pending FDIC special assessment, which could occur during the fourth quarter. And we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be between $200 million and $250 million. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.John G. PancariJust regarding the office increase in nonperformers that you discussed a bit, could you just give us a little bit more detail? Is that more indicative of -- did you see an acceleration in the deterioration of these credits that were noteworthy in the quarter and that necessitated to move to nonaccrual? Or was this more of a function of an ongoing scrub of your portfolio as your as you're reevaluating collateral values or whatnot behind properties? And as you do that as well, can you maybe talk about some of the value depreciation you're beginning to see on some properties that are traded?William S. DemchakI guess what I would say is what you're seeing is kind of our expected cycle through deteriorating credit. So our criticized list didn't really move. We moved inside of that loans to nonperforming. By the way, I think they're actually all still accruing. We just kind of get there because we don't think they're refinanceable in the current market. The move to nonperforming from already being criticized comes about as you just watch cap rates creeping higher and adjust the underlying value of the properties accordingly. So I don't -- I mean, none of this is a surprise. We have heavy reserves against it. We kind of saw it coming. It's the big bulk of these properties moving through the snake, as it were.Robert Q. ReillyJust the migration of the path. We do expect losses, as I said in my comments, but we believe that we're appropriately reserved.William S. DemchakThere's no -- there's -- it's not like there's some new scrubbing, John. I mean, we've been -- we're live on every one of these properties every day. So it's not like we opened a drawer and found something. We know exactly what (inaudible) these are and we are monitoring and updating (inaudible).John G. PancariGot it. Okay. And then separately on the expense side, can you maybe help us think about how the how the $325 million that you expect to fall out of the bottom line from the headcount rationalization? How that would impact the growth rate that you expect overall for expenses in 2024 versus 2023. How should we think about that growth?Robert Q. ReillyYes. So I mentioned in my opening comments, when we walk down both the CIP that we anticipate implementing in '24 along with this workforce reduction that our objective is to keep '24 expenses stable year-over-year. We haven't completed our budget process. In fact, we're at the beginning of our budget process. So we don't have a lot of '24 guidance for you other than that is our objective, and that will be our expectation.William S. DemchakJohn, the other thing -- the reason we kind of put the continuous improvement in there is it's a number that we typically reinvest into our growth businesses in the future of the company. So that's sort of what's been driving our investment game for the last bunch of years, and that continues. What's new is basically dropping the run rate related to personnel and just tightening the ship in what is a tougher revenue environment.John G. PancariGot it. Got it. And I'm sorry, if I could ask just one more. On the Signature acquisition, of the Signature loans, that is, the $0.10 of accretion that you mentioned on that. Can you maybe just walk us through the components of that, how you arrive at that amount?Robert Q. ReillySure. That's basically the yield in terms of the portfolio that we purchased. They are short term, about a year. So we do expect that $0.10 a share that we talked about in the fourth quarter and then going into '24. But when we get to 24, of course, we'll include that in our full year guidance.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Matt O'Cornor with Deutsche Bank.Unidentified AnalystThis is (inaudible) on behalf of Matt O'Connor. Just one quick follow-up on the expense program. You talked about the $725 million total cost actions. So outside of the workplace reduction, can you just talk about the -- just the other areas of efficiencies you're investing in?William S. DemchakI mean the workforce reduction is the specific number we mentioned of the $325 million inside of continuous improvement, which we do every year. We're focused on contract renewals, on management of the (inaudible), building...Robert Q. ReillySegments.William S. DemchakOccupancy, efficiencies, all the things you'd expect us to be focused on in the ordinary course of running the business.Robert Q. ReillyAnd that's a program that we've had in place, as I mentioned, for several years and allows us to -- it has allowed us to grow annual expenses in the low single-digit range, even with all those investments. And in point of fact, this year, we're pointing to 1% growth year-over-year -- '23 over '22 and a large part of that is because of our continuous improvement program.Unidentified AnalystAnd then if I could just ask a follow-up question on the capital markets fees. So they came in weaker than expected this quarter. You talked about, I think, stable versus the last quarter. One of your larger peers reported stronger capital markets this morning. Can you just talk about the driver of this? Was it mostly mix related? And then maybe touch on the outlook near term given the macro outlook is better than a few months ago?William S. DemchakI didn't -- I'm not sure what anybody else reported. My guess was that the trading line item was better than peer fees. But -- in our case, the bulk of our capital markets income come from various advisory fees from Harris Williams or Solebury or syndications and so forth. And while the pipelines remain robust, if not at record levels, the activity level, while there's been some green shoots just hasn't been strong. Eventually, it flows through, but we're getting a little tired of predicting when it will be.Robert Q. ReillyBut I would add to that, our capital markets is weighted towards our M&amp;A advisory, Harris Williams. We had a soft second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, our pipelines were higher than the first quarter. So we thought naturally that the third quarter would be higher, but it wasn't. So we find ourselves at the end of the third quarter with even higher pipelines than we had at the beginning of the quarter. But inside of that, a subset of the pipeline are signed deals, which that part is higher than it was at this point last quarter. So we do expect to see the lift, and our expectations are that we get back to first quarter levels.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.Robert Scott SiefersI wanted to ask sort of a broad question on NII. Are we getting to a point where that will start to trough. So maybe, Rob, just sort of some of the puts and takes. It seems like your deposit betas are coming in as expected or better. I know there should be some asset repricing as we look into next year. But some of the larger banks have been sort of vocal about the degree to which there's still overearning on NII, which I think is kind of kept these fears of still bleeding out NII sort of industry-wide. Maybe just some thoughts on how you see things playing out for PNC, in particular.William S. DemchakI'll start. All of it ends up being dependent on what you think the Fed is going to do. Personally, I think the Fed is higher for longer, even higher for longer than the market expects on our official forecast. I guess we have 2 cuts towards the back half of next year. As short rates stay higher, you will continue to see betas creep up, both because we're going to reprice the back book and secondly, because you'll just not on betas, but just on the shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing. So when that inflection point is -- has in some ways to do the most with what's going on with the yield curve and the Fed. As the curve continues to flatten by the long end selling off, all else equal, that helps not withstanding the markets on our existing bonds, it helps with the price we get on the roll down and reinvestment. So there's too many variables in there. But the basic notion that were at the inflection point, I think, is entirely dependent on what happens with the Fed in the coming year. And we haven't done our budget yet, so we're not going to call it.Robert Q. ReillyI would just add to that, just observations. Deposits continue to decline. We expected that, but that decline is slowing. Betas have gone up but the increase has slowed. In fact, in the third quarter, they came -- actuals came in lower than what we expected for the first time since rates have been increasing rapidly. So things have slowed as far as that trajectory is. And then obviously, the inflection point issues that Bill just covered are valid.Robert Scott SiefersOkay. Perfect. And then maybe a question on credit as well. I guess there -- just in the last few weeks, there have been a couple of commercial hiccups in the industry in the shared national credit space. Just was hoping you might be able to remind us about PNC's exposure in this next phase and then just generalization, sort of how that portfolio quality compares to the rest of the book, how much you lead, et cetera?Robert Q. ReillyYes, pretty good there, Scott in terms of credit. So all the noise, so to speak, is in the commercial real estate office space that we spoke about. As far as the shared national credit results went, they're complete. They're represented in our numbers, and it was pretty benign in terms of total deals, upgrades were more than downgrades, but they were a handful of each.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.Gerard Sean CassidyYou guys gave us good color on the burn off of the securities portfolio. A question I had is, it looked like this quarter, you put more up a descend. So what are you guys doing with the cash flows from the portfolio now in terms of where you're putting it in other securities? And then second, once the Basel III end game is finalized, how do you think you guys will approach in carrying your securities? Will you carry less on available for sale or more? Can you share with us your thoughts there as well?William S. DemchakJust with the existing book, it's running down. We've run down the DV01 in our securities and swaps through the course of the entire year. We've had some purchases but not to the extent we've had maturities and we've been buying, I don't know what average yield is, but stuff that roughly carries flat versus leaving it into Fed. Going forward, the switch from available for sale to held to maturity doesn't really affect anything. It's an accounting entry. So we'll keep some amount in available for sale to the extent we trade around that book. But we don't trade around that book all that much, and the rest will just buy and down to maturity, which is, by the way, what we've been doing thus far since rates have gone up.Robert Q. ReillyThere's a couple of things to add. One of the uses of cash, Gerard, was the purchase of the signature loans. So that was our biggest -- that was our biggest outlay. Yes, that was our biggest outlay. And then on the split, Bill has it right. Where we are now is probably about where we are, plus or minus to your views in terms of -- but where we got to holding it all to 100% of AFS was the tailoring, which has passed us. So we're back to sort of the normal split.Gerard Sean CassidyVery good. And then as a follow-up, you just mentioned about the purchase of the signature loans. You guys are in a good position that not being impacted by Basel III end-game, RWA inflation like some of the big money centers, of course. Do you think there's going to be opportunities for you guys to buy other portfolios, not from the FDIC per se, but from some of your peers or banks that do mitigation strategies to get to these RWA targets they need to get to?William S. DemchakI suppose there could be. I don't know that we've actually seen any. We get pitched by everybody to execute one, which we don't need for. But the purchase side of that is actually pretty attractive. They're giving away a lot of economics. So actually a good thought. I'll go look around.Robert Q. ReillyNo, we have the capital flexibility to do it, and people know our telephone number.Gerard Sean CassidyYes. And then specifically, it would be more in the C&amp;I space or consumer? Or do you guys have a preference should they call that phone number, Rob?William S. DemchakIt's -- look, we're intelligent -- hopefully, intelligent takers of risk at the right price. We can evaluate what's out there.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question is from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.Bill CarcacheBill and Rob, I wanted to follow up on your office CRE comments. How much of an impact to debt service coverage are PNC customers experiencing from swaps that are rolling off, saying cases where they issued floating rate debt on reserve 2 to 3 years ago and put on swaps to lock in low fixed rates at the time but are now facing a significant reset as those swaps mature. I'm just curious if how significant that maturing swap dynamic is inside of the portfolio and whether you feel like you have a good handle on that dynamic?William S. DemchakI don't know the answer to that. I would tell you though the bulk of our stuff, and you see it in our maturity schedules, we are kind of stabilization loans, project loans. And so in that instance, the hedge dynamics of somebody would put on that loan. My experience would be less than what they would have done on a term, 10-year CMBS alternative. So my guess is it's not -- I think they're just in trouble floating rate loans, from lease rates going down, from vacancies going up and from the rehab costs of redoing floors.Robert Q. ReillyCapital improvements.William S. DemchakYes. Just dropping the value of the buildings.Bill CarcacheUnderstood. That's helpful. And if I could follow up on that. If refinancing loans at current market rates would cause debt service coverage ratios to fall below one, can you discuss how much leeway there is inside of PNC to refinance loans under potentially more favorable terms to allow debt service coverage ratios to remain satisfactory. And then maybe just more broadly across the industry, do you think so-called extended pretend dynamics could become pervasive, particularly since banks have made it clear they don't own office buildings. And we've seen some commentary from regulators sort of urging banks to work with their customers.William S. DemchakWell, I think the extend part is possible. I think the pretend part, that doesn't work. We work with borrowers to figure out how to maximize the value of the property because that's ultimately going to maximize the value of our loan. In some instances, that means taking the building and selling it. In some instances, that means getting more equity capital, extending a loan at a debt service coverage ratio, we normally wouldn't under the theory that they can lease it up itself. But each and every one of those decisions is a decision tree based on what's the net present value of what we PNC can get against our loan. In any event, if we do something that is uneconomic relative to the original loan, that shows up in our reserves or charge-offs or so on and so forth. There's no pretend involved.Bill CarcacheUnderstood. That's very helpful, Bill. And if I could squeeze in one last one on the point about whether we're at an inflection point on deposit betas sort of depending on the Fed. Does it correlate? That suggests that we could see terminal beta expectations potentially drift higher relative to prior guidance, again, depending on how much higher for longer persists?William S. DemchakYes, I think -- and by the way, this isn't a forecast. I think it's just common sense, right? To the extent that we still have a back book of business as does everybody that hasn't necessarily repriced. And if rates are pinned at 5% forever in time, that beta will continue to go up. It's a function of how high does the Fed go and how long do they stay there, and everybody has been wrong so far. So yes, it's a possibility.Bill CarcacheUnderstood. I wanted to ask you another one about the CFPB sort of open banking proposal, Bill, but I'll queue back up for that one.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Peter Troisi with Barclays.Peter Vincent TroisiThanks very much for the disclosure on the long-term debt shortfall in the slides. You talked about $10 billion of debt issuance annually. But do you anticipate needing to issue more than $10 billion to close the shortfall that you disclosed in the slides? Or can the $8 billion shortfall at the bank be met just by restructuring existing internal debt. And I guess the question really is, do you expect to issue debt at the holding company specifically to invest in the internal debt of the bank?Robert Q. ReillyYes. This is Rob. So good question. So in regard to the long-term debt, our message is independent of the rules. As we resume a more conventional funding structure in terms of our debt to our deposits, that was precoded, we would be compliant. So that's the takeaway. In regard to how we get there, it's a combination of everything that you outlined. There will be issuances at the holding company as part of our ongoing plan that will then ultimately be papered down to the bank. But there's a lot of moving parts there. The message is we'll get there, and we would have gotten there independent of these rules.OperatorOur next question is a follow-up question from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.Bill CarcacheYes. So Bill, I was hoping you could just share your thoughts on the CFPB's plans to propose an open banking rule. There's a view that open banking essentially forces the industry to hand over the keys to the customer relationship. You've talked in the past about sort of the dynamic of like passwords and all that kind of stuff. But I was just hoping you could speak broadly to that point, through that topic?William S. DemchakYes. I think what I've seen thus far out of CFPB commentary is they're largely focused on some of the right things: make it easier for customers, agree with that; secure data, agree with that; don't allow data to be sold and commercialized without customer permission, I agree with that; make customers agree to specific data items want they want to share in a secure environment. So all of that stuff versus where we are today, where it's a free for all, and there's a lot of fraud. Actually, I'm in favor of. The notion of kind of open banking where somehow I can just lift and shift my account from one bank to another because now there's technology to do it, I'm not that afraid of that. It's more in the technology to allow it in a secure manner, dependent of what rule is written, doesn't exist today. And I kind of look at what they're doing and hope it's a step in the right direction on security and the safety and soundness of customer information leading to a reduction in fraud across the industry. The sound bites are, that's where they're going.Bill CarcacheOkay. That's helpful. I had heard something along the lines of some of the actions we're taking are intended to make it easier for customers ""to break up with their banks."" And so I was wondering if there was anything in the language. You mentioned now you're not worried about the ability to shift the relationship. So...William S. DemchakLook, at the end of the day -- by the way, if that happened, terrific. We compete every day, and we have good customer service and great products, we'll be a net beneficiary. Practically, the technology to allow that to happen. So just think about the notion of, okay, now you have connected APIs that allow somebody to gather information and move information. Now you need to build a program that keeps track of the back book while you open a new book on a checking account, transfers, balances on cards. So eventually, somebody come up with a cool business model that might be able to do that on the back of a pause that allow it on the back of APIs that haven't been written yet on the back of technology that links all the banks and question together. But that hasn't happened yet.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.Michael Lawrence MayoSorry about that earlier. So in terms of the decline in commercial loans, is how much of that decline is due to softer demand? And how much of that is deliberate as you look to shore up capital more than you previously would have intended?William S. DemchakWell, none of it is deliberate per se. We've seen some drop in utilization. We've seen a drop in kind of refinance rate as people are -- you think about a corporate loan revolver, where it's a 3-year and every 2 years, you renew it for the next 3 years. Everybody is kind of extending that under the hope that things are going to get better on spreads. So there's just been less activity. At the margin, we are extending less credit into credit-only new relationships on the hope that we're going to get fees versus protecting our wallet where we already have a lot of fees and get cross-sell. But that's kind of a met the margin.Robert Q. ReillyThat's small. It's on the demand side.Michael Lawrence MayoOkay. And you're very clear about the expense guidance and the tough actions you're taking with personnel. Did you give an outlook for operating leverage over next year? Do you think the pace of expense decline will be faster than any decline in revenues? And specifically to the fourth quarter, the SBNY loan acquisition looks like it adds a couple of percent to your fourth quarter NII, but you're guiding down 1% to 2%. So that decline might be a little bit more than some had expected. Is it more than you had expected? The quarter decline looks like 2% to 4% in the fourth quarter. Is that math correct? Why is it down, maybe more than you thought? And the big question, though, is revenues versus expenses over the next year?Robert Q. ReillyDo you want me to? Well, on the expense issue, we did say that we expect '24 expenses to be stable. And we haven't finished our budgeting cycle. So we can't really answer in terms of anything beyond that in '24. In regard to the NII in the fourth quarter guide, it does include the Signature acquisition, which we said was about $0.10 a share. Recall in the third quarter, we had expected 3% to 5% decline. We ended up down 3%. So when we look to the fourth quarter, roll all that together, that's how we get down 1% to 2%.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.Kenneth Michael UsdinOne follow-up on the Signature acquisition as well. So just wondering if you can provide a little more context on the portfolio, seeing the line that you're expecting to hold on to -- or expecting to hold on to 75% of the relationships over time. Are you bringing on new team members? Is there expenses along with that? And just anything you can help us in terms of like the duration of the loans? And is there just kind of a natural runoff that happens given I think that they're generally a pretty short duration type of loan?William S. DemchakYes. It's de minimis adds of people that we're bringing on. We're already in the business. We have the technology to be in the business. We know the clients. The rundown, we're kind of saying 75% probably survive. Most of that is simply a function of where we have overlap with clients and the size hold that we want to have for a particular client. We'd syndicate more of it as we kind of rightsize our hold. There may be inside of that book of business, a handful of people that we would choose not to renew. But the credit quality is pristine. We know we underwrote every fund that is in that. And through time, you would expect that as they mature, we'll renew. In some period of time out a couple of years, we'll end up with 75% of the notional that we started with, and you'll have no clue between now and then. How much it was.Robert Q. ReillyBut that's right. De minimis expense is involved with it, and we're excited about it.Kenneth Michael UsdinYes. That's a fair point on we won't know. That's what I was trying to ask. The second question is...William S. DemchakBut to be clear, it will be lost inside of our book of business. It becomes part of our C&amp;I balance.Kenneth Michael UsdinCompletely understood. The second question I had, Bill, is you mentioned in a higher long-form environment, we got to see what the Fed does in terms of where deposit betas and mix goes. On the asset side, however, though, can you help us understand what happens in terms of fixed rate loan repricing versus -- and how much you might still have left in that versus obviously when we get to a peak in Fed funds, we'll know that the variable rates will have gotten there.William S. DemchakYes. So we have I mean, beyond our securities book and swaps, which obviously we will reprice over the next several years, we have -- I don't know the percentage off the top of my head, percentage of our loan book, either fixed rate to begin with, think of an auto loan or with swaps on top of it, floating rate loan, we swapped to fixed. And those fixed rate loans and swaps are shorter duration typically than what we have in the securities book. And there's a lot of dry powder there that will reprice. We are back to this notion that, ""Hey, we're out there competing and growing this company."" We will be originating those loans as they reprice. We're not dumping assets and getting out of things. It's going to shrink the total volume that's on our book.Kenneth Michael UsdinYes. No. Totally understand. I would think it would be a net positive as an offset to whatever has happened.William S. DemchakA little bit. You have the competing parts, right? We're going to have repricing of fixed rate assets, fighting reprices of our liabilities. At some point, that's going to cross and banks are going to grow NII at high percentages. I just can't tell you when that is yet, and we haven't done our budget next year.Kenneth Michael UsdinYes, that's fair.OperatorAnd there are no further questions on the phone lines at this time.Bryan K. GillOkay. Well, thank you. Thanks for participating. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team.Thanks.OperatorThat does conclude the conference call for today, and we do thank you for your participation.]"

The fact that these other banks seem to do well in that area, does that actually bode a little bit better for the regionals?DAVID CHIAVERINI: It does bode better, at least for the near-term. Looking at third quarter results, we're expecting net interest income to come down but be down less severe than what we saw in the second quarter. Higher for longer is going to be a headwind for the group. And I think the reason why we're seeing the bank sell off today relates to what you alluded to earlier, credit quality.Commercial real estate, when we look at PNC, their credit metrics, non-performing loans for CRE doubled in the quarter. And that's a concern looking out to next year as CRE maturities start to come through, and regional banks do have exposure to CRE. So it really is an issue of credit quality that I think is taking down the banks today, despite NEI coming in better than expected.Story continuesJOSH LIPTON: And David, deposits have stabilized, but banks are still going to have a tougher time just keeping depositors from chasing higher rates elsewhere. How much of a headwind do you see that in the quarters ahead?DAVID CHIAVERINI: Yeah, I think that's going to be a continued issue in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. As long as the Fed is closer to halting its rate increases-- and it looks like we are. Near the end, maybe we get one more hike-- then we're going to see the second derivative slow down on increasing deposit costs.So we're getting towards the end in that regard. So that's the sort of bright spot. Everything above the loan loss provision line for the bank income statements should look pretty good over the next year. But credit quality is kind of the overhang.JULIE HYMAN: Well, and we've been hearing from non-bank companies that lower income consumers are starting to get maybe a little bit more pressured, a little bit more choosy. How is that going to then feed through to the banks from everything from credit losses to deposit growth to loans and anything else?DAVID CHIAVERINI: Yeah. It's a great point. I mean, let's face it, consumers drive 70% of the economy. So if they're showing weakness, it is going to filter through to the rest of the economy. And fortunately for the regional banks, consumer exposure is relatively low. Most of the exposure tends to be residential mortgage in that credit quality. And we see that home price appreciation continues to be mostly positive except on the coast.But the home equity that's been built up should provide some stability and lessen any potential credit losses coming out of the consumer. I do also cover some of the neobanks, so Upstart, SoFi, LendingClub, Pagaya. And they do cater to-- a couple of them are at the upper end of the credit spectrum, SoFi and LendingClub, 725 to 750 type of ficos. But Upstart and Pahaya, they're at the lower end of the credit spectrum. And we have seen some weakness in their credit metrics, so that's something to be mindful of.]"

The company sees higher rates playing a big role in business investment and consumer spending to impact their bottom line going into mid 2024.For more on PNC earnings, I'm joined by Alexander Yokum, CFRA Research senior equity research analyst. Good to talk to you today. What was the one line here that stood out to you? Any real surprises in the results?ALEXANDER YOKUM: In terms of surprises, I wouldn't necessarily say that. But there was a little bit of weakness on the balance sheet. If you look at deposits and loans, both down. There's been a lot of talk about loan growth slowing. And PNC is heavy in commercial loans, so think like businesses. And businesses don't want loans right now. They're holding out hope that rates will fall. And it hasn't happened. So we saw some pretty weak loan balances, actually loan contraction for PNC.And then on the deposit side, there was some weakness there. And there's been a story about rising funding costs. We've seen that continue. And for PNC noninterest bearing deposits continued to run off, which is a concern just because those-- if you can get non-interest-bearing deposits into loans, that's very profitable. So when you lose those, it tends to hurt.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: Going back to loan balances there, certainly a good pulse when you look at these numbers, given that it is the second largest regional bank. I mean, what does that tell you about a further slowdown in the current quarter and given how quickly credit is tightening right now?ALEXANDER YOKUM: Yeah. Honestly, there's been a slowdown for pretty much every category outside of credit card. Now for PNC, also some slowdown there. But in general across the industry, credit card has still been strong. But yeah, I mean with rates higher, we've definitely seen a big uptick at the higher end of the yield curve.Not today or the last few days, but over the last few weeks, definitely an increase there. So yeah, loan demand is down. And as long as rates are this high, we wouldn't expect strong loan growth for banking in general over the next few quarters.]"

However, the bottom line reflects a 4.8% decline year over year.Shares of PNC fell 1.5% in pre-market trading, despite better-than-expected results. A full-day trading session will depict a clearer picture.Results were aided by a fall in non-interest expenses and lower provisions. However, a decrease in net interest income (NII) and non-interest income were headwinds.Net income was $1.57 billion, decreasing 4.3% from the prior-year quarter. Our model estimated net income to be $1.39 billion.Revenues and Expenses FallTotal quarterly revenues were $5.23 billion, down 5.7% year over year. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.31 billion.Quarterly NII was $3.42 billion, which declined 1.6% from the year-ago quarter. Net interest margin (NIM) decreased 11 basis points to 2.71%. Our estimate for NII and NIM was $3.38 billion and 2.72%, respectively.Non-interest income fell 12.5% year over year to $1.82 billion. The decline was due to a fall in almost all fee income components, except for card and cash management fees, lending and deposit services fees, and residential and commercial mortgage fees. Our estimate was $1.97 billion.Non-interest expenses totaled $3.25 billion, decreasing 1.1% from the year-ago figure. All cost components decreased, except occupany costs and equipment costs. Our estimate for total non-interest expenses was $3.38 billion.The efficiency ratio was 62% compared with 59% in the year-ago quarter. A rise in the efficiency ratio reflects lower profitability.As of Sep 30, 2023, total loans were $318.42 billion, which decreased 1% on a sequential basis. Our estimate for total loans was $321.65 billion. Also, total deposits decreased nearly 1% from the end of the previous quarter to $423.61 billion. Our estimate for total deposits was $429.01 billion.Credit Quality WorsensNet loan charge-offs were $121 million, up 1.7% year over year. Also, the allowance for credit losses increased 2.7% to $5.41 billion. Non-performing loans increased 2.7% year over year to $1.12 billion.Story continuesNonetheless, the company reported a provision for credit losses of $129 million in the third quarter, lower than the $241 million reported in the year-earlier quarter.Capital Position Improves &amp; Profitability Ratios WeakenAs of Sep 30, 2023, the Basel III common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 9.8% compared with 9.3% as of Sep 30, 2022.Return on average assets and average common shareholders’ equity were 1.12% and 13.65%, respectively, compared with 1.19% and 14.97% witnessed in the prior-year quarter.Capital Distribution ActivityIn the third quarter of 2023, PNC Financial returned $0.6 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends on common shares.Our ViewpointPNC Financial is well-poised to grow on the back of its diverse revenue mix.

During these times, you’re more likely to get caught up in long lines and have difficulty finding a store representative to help you if you need it. You may also be facing limited stock on the shelves, depending on how busy your particular location gets.See: Don’t Shop at Dollar Tree on This Day of the WeekLearn: How To Get Cash Back on Your Everyday PurchasesIf you’re trying to find ways to avoid the crowds and still get the best deals at Target, here are the best and worst times to plan your shopping trip.Best Days To Shop at Target: Tuesday and WednesdayWhile the best and worst days to shop may vary a little by location, many major retailers — like Walmart and Target — have similar patterns when it comes to how busy they get and their restocking schedule.“In my opinion, the best days to shop at Target would be early on weekdays, particularly Tuesday and Wednesday,” said Liam Lucas, owner of Off Road Genius. “Many retail stores, including Target, restock their shelves during these days, giving customers access to fresh inventory and a wider selection of items.”You may want to time your visit to ensure you go in the mornings, though.“The best days of the week to shop at Target are weekdays in the morning,” added Scott Lieberman, founder of Touchdown Money. “You’ll typically find fewer people at the store, meaning you’ll be able to really explore the aisles, see the discounts — and have them be in stock.”Interesting: 5 Things You Should Always Buy at Estate SalesWorst Day To Shop at Target: SaturdayIf the best days to shop at Target are during the middle of the week, then it should come as no surprise that the worst days are typically the weekends. In particular, you should generally avoid shopping on Saturdays as they tend to be busier and have a more limited selection of discounted items.Story continues“Weekends, especially Saturdays, can be the worst days to shop at Target,” said Lucas. “This is when the stores are most crowded, leading to longer check-out lines and potentially depleted stock from high customer volume.”For similar reasons, you may also want to avoid the store on Sundays. Unlike Saturday, however, Sundays at least come with the release of Target’s new weekly ad and its storewide discounts.Also, avoid going to your local Target near the holidays as a lot of other people will have the same idea and be heading to the store for their shopping needs.“Target is typically more crowded on holidays and the days leading up to holidays, so this is a time to avoid shopping if possible,” said Ivan Marusic, founder of Game Boy World.If you need to get some shopping done around the holidays, try to do it online. But be aware that delivery times may be longer. Certain in-demand items are also more likely to be out of stock around the holidays, and anything that was discounted could already be gone.Tips To Save Time and Money at TargetHere are a few strategies you can use to optimize your Target shopping experience and save a bit of money:Use Target’s rewards program. This is a free app that gives you exclusive discounts and deals storewide. “Make sure to sign up for Target’s Circle rewards program, where you’ll save 1% on items, get deals tailored to your shopping habits, discounts on your birthday, and more,” said Lieberman.Get the Target RedCard. Target’s RedCard is a store card that lets you save money on your purchases. “Utilising Target’s RedCard can help shoppers save 5% on all purchases,” said Lucas.Purchase your items in advance. “Consider doing ‘pick up and go’ on Target.com, where you shop and pay for your items online, then go in store to pick up those items at designated areas,” said Lieberman. “This will help reduce impulse shopping (which is almost guaranteed at Target!) and can help you stick to your budget better.” To further resist impulse buys, take advantage of Target’s curbside delivery service.Buy from the clearance section. Like many retailers, Target has a clearance section that’s worth checking out. After all, you never know what deals you might find there. “Target has a clearance section where you can find items that have been marked down significantly,” said Marusic. “The clearance section is typically located at the back of the store, so be sure to check it out before you leave.” Just avoid buying things you don’t need.Get the weekly ad.

Although third-quarter production exceeded the second quarter's, it fell short of initial plans for the quarter, notably at Pueblo Viejo, where equipment design issues caused delays in the expansion project. The company anticipates a significant increase in production during the fourth quarter.During the third quarter, the average market price for gold was $1,928 per ounce, while copper averaged $3.79 per pound.The rise in preliminary third-quarter gold production from the second quarter’s levels can be attributed to increased output at Cortez, driven by higher oxide production from the Crossroads open pit and Cortez Hills underground. Planned autoclave maintenance at Turquoise Ridge in the previous quarter and improved grades at Kibali contributed to higher production. However, Carlin experienced lower production due to reduced ore grades from processed stockpiled ore.Barrick Gold Corporation Price and Consensus Barrick Gold Corporation Price and ConsensusBarrick Gold Corporation price-consensus-chart | Barrick Gold Corporation Quote Compared with the second quarter, third-quarter gold cost of sales per ounce is expected to be 2-4% lower, total cash costs per ounce are anticipated to be 4-6% lower and all-in sustaining costs per ounce are expected to be up to 6-8% lower.Preliminary third-quarter copper production was higher than the second quarter, primarily driven by increased output at Lumwana. In comparison to the second quarter, third-quarter copper cost of sales per pound is expected to be 5-7% lower, C1 cash costs per pound are expected to be 9-11% lower. However, all-in-sustaining costs per pound are projected to be 2-4% higher, mainly due to increased capitalized stripping at Lumwana.Barrick stock has gained 6.9% in the past year compared with the industry’s rise of 26.6% in the same period.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Key PicksBarrick currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are WestRock Company WRK, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

The top line is likely to have been weighed down by reduced supplemental revenues, a decline in export coal benchmark prices and a decrease in intermodal volumes.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Merchandise revenues is pegged at $2,128 million, indicating a 0.6% decline from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Intermodal revenues is pegged at $506 million, indicating a 16.2% decline from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Coal revenues is pegged at $588 million, indicating a 5.8% decline from the year-ago reported figure.On the flip side, supply-chain disruptions, including labor and equipment shortages, are expected to have hurt CSX’s third-quarter performance. Rising fuel expenses continue to bother the company’s bottom line. CSX’s high capital expenditures may further impede its bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSX’s third-quarter 2023 earnings has been revised downward by 12.2% in the past 90 days.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for CSX this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CSX has an Earnings ESP of -2.26% and a Zacks Rank #3.Story continuesCSX Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCSX Corporation price-eps-surprise | CSX Corporation QuoteHighlights of Q2CSX's second-quarter 2023 earnings per share of 49 cents matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the bottom line declined year over year.Total revenues of $3,699 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,730.6 million. The top line decreased 3% year over year due to lower fuel prices, reduced supplemental revenues, a decline in export coal benchmark prices and a decrease in intermodal volumes. These factors offset the effects of volume growth in coal and merchandise and solid gains in merchandise pricing.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on their third-quarter 2023 earnings:Kirby Corporation KEX has an Earnings ESP of +6.52% and a Zacks Rank #2.

176,5afe1d02-4b8a-31c8-ba01-8c1fe101b2a1,RF,2023-10-14,Regions Financial (RF) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regions-financial-rf-earnings-expected-140009324.html,1697205609,STORY,['RF'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Regions Financial (RF) reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 20, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis holding company for Regions Bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.4%.Revenues are expected to be $1.88 billion, up 0.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.03% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Regions Financial?For Regions Financial, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.36%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Regions Financial will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Regions Financial would post earnings of $0.60 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.59, delivering a surprise of -1.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Regions Financial appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Southeast industry, F.N.B. (FNB), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.36 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -7.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $403.07 million, up 6.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for F.N.B. has been revised 4.3% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 1.84%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that F.N.B. will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

178,6a7e5f89-cbfe-30a7-90fc-b91485cc2dd3,V,2023-10-14,Seeking Stability? Goldman Sachs Says These 2 ‘Blue Chip’ Stocks Are Less Vulnerable to Rising Rates,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seeking-stability-goldman-sachs-says-190931972.html,1697224171,STORY,"['GS', 'V', 'MA']","[Policies can have a ripple effect, often going beyond their initial intent. We’re seeing this now from the Federal Reserve, which has made it clear that, in response to stubbornly persistent inflation, it will be holding interest rates higher for longer.This trend aligns with observations made by David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs. Kostin points out that stocks have shown a strong return on equity (ROE) over the past several decades, reflecting a positive combination of profitability and efficiency. However, these prosperous times may be coming to an end as higher interest rates start impacting corporate activities.“If rates continue to rise or stay higher for longer,” Kostin states in his recent note, “increased borrowing costs would disincentivize companies from taking on greater amounts of leverage.”To guide investors, Kostin has listed a range of stocks that he believes are “less vulnerable to rising rates and offer stability amid greater macro uncertainty.” Prominent among his picks are credit card issuers and processors. These companies have been benefiting from strong consumer spending in recent years, and the industry giants among them possess the deep resources necessary to weather the impact of rising interest rates. Let’s take a closer look at two of these ‘blue chip’ names.Mastercard (MA)We’ll start with Mastercard, one of the market’s true ‘blue chip’ stocks. With a market cap of $374 billion, Mastercard is currently the third-largest of the major credit card issuer/processor companies (Visa and JPMorgan Chase hold the first and second spots, respectively) and has been an industry leader since its founding in 1966.The company has over 3,900 clients in more than 120 countries and handles more than 125 billion purchase transactions annually at more than 80 million merchant locations.Mastercard will report its 3Q23 results late this month – but a look at the Q2 results is informative. In Q2, Mastercard showed several solid metrics, starting with the gross dollar volume of $2.3 trillion, up 12% year-over-year. Cross-border transaction volumes were up 24%, and the company’s adjusted net revenue came to $6.3 billion, up 14% from the $5.5 billion in 2Q22, and beating the forecast by $130 million. The company’s bottom line, reported as a non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS of $2.89, was 6 cents ahead of the expectations.Story continuesAmong the bulls is Goldman Sachs analyst Will Nance, who sees future growth potential as the key story.“We continue to see strong tailwinds for MA over the next several years, especially given its greater leverage to the emerging markets, where card penetration is lower, as well as the company’s strategic focus on value added services. With shares currently trading at 27x 2024E P/E, shares are trading roughly in-line with history, and appear cheap relative to the market (even excluding FAAMG). We believe the company’s superior growth profile screens as attractive and would lean into any further weakness over the next few months,” Nance opined.Looking ahead, Nance rates MA stock a Buy, and his $456 price target implies a one-year upside potential of ~15%. (To watch Nance’s track record, click here)Overall, big-name stocks like Mastercard never lack for Wall Street attention, and there are 20 recent reviews of MA shares with a breakdown of 19 to 1 favoring Buy over Hold for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is currently priced at $397.67 and its average price target of $462.72 is slightly more bullish than the Goldman view, suggesting ~16% gain in the next 12 months. (See Mastercard stock forecast)Visa Inc. (V)Next up is Visa, the world’s largest credit card issuer with a market cap approaching $493 billion and more than 4.2 billion branded VISA cards in use, issued by more than 15,000 financial institutions.Visa handled approximately 269 billion payment transactions in the 12 months that ended this past June 30, conducted through more than 100 million merchant locations in 200 countries globally. There are not many companies that operate on this scale, in any niche.Visa saw strong performance in the last reported quarter of the company’s fiscal year 2023, which ended in June. The quarter showed a top-line net revenue of $8.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year, and came in $40 million ahead of the estimates. The company’s non-GAAP net income was $4.5 billion, or $2.16 per share; that EPS figure was 4 cents per share better than had been expected.The company has seen a strong annualized increase in its payments volume of 9%, driven by its ‘cross-border transactions excluding intra-Europe,’ which were up 22%. Total processed transactions were 10% year-over-year.Checking in again with Will Nance, we find that the Goldman Sachs analyst is sanguine on Visa’s potential going forward. He writes of the company, “Overall, trends in the business continue to be relatively stable and the company sees significant runway remaining for the core consumer payments business, while making progress with new flows (~10x larger opportunity than consumer payments)… We view the space as attractive, with macro sentiment improving and with valuations at relative lows.”Nance quantifies his bullish stance with a Buy rating on V, while his $286 price target indicates his confidence in a 21% upside on the one-year horizon. (To watch Nance’s track record, click here)Overall, Visa has picked up 24 reviews recently from the Street’s analysts, and these include 20 Buys and 4 Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock’s average target price of $281.91 implies a one-year gain of ~19% from the current share price of $236.96.

Its Earnings Per Share (EPS) stands at 3.07. But is the stock fairly valued? This article aims to answer this question by providing an in-depth analysis of Amphenol's valuation. Read on to understand better the intrinsic value of Amphenol.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with MTCH.Amphenol is a global supplier of connectors, sensors, and interconnect systems. The company holds the second-largest connector market share worldwide, selling into various end markets, including automotive, broadband, commercial air, industrial, IT and data communications, military, mobile devices, and mobile networks. With operations in 40 countries, Amphenol has a diversified geographical presence.Amphenol (APH)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueAmphenol (NYSE:APH) is currently priced at $82.23 per share, with a market cap of $49 billion. Compared to the GF Value of $85.92, the stock appears to be fairly valued. But to get a clearer picture, let's dive deeper into the GF Value calculation.Understanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the stock's ideal fair trading value.According to the GF Value, Amphenol seems to be fairly valued. The GF Value is derived from historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the stock's share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued, indicating potentially poor future returns. Conversely, if the stock's share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued, indicating potentially high future returns.Given that Amphenol is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Story continuesAmphenol (APH)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent capital loss. Therefore, reviewing a company's financial strength is crucial before deciding to invest in its stock. A good starting point is the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Amphenol has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.35, which is worse than 79.98% of 2363 companies in the Hardware industry. However, GuruFocus ranks Amphenol's overall financial strength at 7 out of 10, indicating fair financial strength.Amphenol (APH)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, carries less risk. A company with high profit margins is typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Amphenol has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years, with a revenue of $12.60 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $3.07 in the past twelve months. Its operating margin is 20.61%, ranking better than 93.33% of 2444 companies in the Hardware industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks Amphenol's profitability at 10 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is one of the most critical factors in a company's valuation. According to GuruFocus research, long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. Amphenol's average annual revenue growth is 15%, ranking better than 78.49% of 2325 companies in the Hardware industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 15.5%, ranking better than 58.7% of 1954 companies in the Hardware industry.ROIC vs WACCOne can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets.

The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Valued at $10.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2024. The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Huntington Beach, CA.What’s Supporting Boeing?For 100 years, Boeing has been leading unmanned technology innovation and integration from sea to air to space.Boeing’s Echo Voyager is a fully autonomous XLUUV-class Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (“UUV”) that can be used for various missions, which were previously impossible due to traditional UUV limitations. The vehicle’s advanced autonomy enables it to perform at sea for months at a time, delivering a more affordable, mission-capable solution over traditional UUVs.Prior to Echo Voyager, Boeing developed Echo Seeker and Echo Ranger, autonomous and large UUVs as test beds for its current XLUUV.The aforementioned discussion reflects the proven expertise of BA in the UUV space. This is likely to have led to a steady inflow of contracts for the company, like the latest one. This, in turn, should bolster its revenue generation prospects from the UUV product line.Growth ProspectsThe recent tiff between Ukraine and Russia has led other nations to strengthen their defense landscape to deter any war-like situation. UUVs are noted for their ability to carry out dangerous maritime operations, such as mine countermeasure missions and harbor patrol. Therefore, as investments in undersea warfare capabilities have increased manifold, so has the demand for state-of-the-art UUVs. Long-endurance, autonomous maritime vehicles offer new ways to gather data and conduct missions in the ocean and communicate across domains to deliver actionable intelligence.With technological advancements, nations are more rapidly adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to increase the autonomy of UUVs. As a result, hefty investments in developing and acquiring autonomous marine systems can be expected in the coming days, thereby boosting the UUV market. To this end, the Fortune Business Insights firm projects the global unmanned underwater vehicle market to witness a CAGR of 13.5% during the 2023-2030 period.Story continuesSuch growth trends should boost Huntington Ingalls along with other defense primes like Huntington Ingalls HII, General Dynamics GD and Lockheed Martin LMT, which have a strong presence in the unmanned underwater vehicle market.Serving customers in more than 30 countries, Huntington Ingalls provides design, autonomy, manufacturing, testing, operations and sustainment of unmanned systems, including UUVs and unmanned surface vessels. Its REMUS family of UUVs consists of low logistics UUVs that can be rapidly deployed from any vessel of opportunity, with their common usage in mine countermeasures, search and recovery and antisubmarine warfare.Huntington Ingalls’ long-term earnings growth rate is 6.6%. The Zacks consensus estimate for HII’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 3.5% from the 2022 reported figure.General Dynamics’ Bluefin SandShark is a one-person-portable, low-cost, autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle designed to leverage today’s miniaturized sensors and emerge as the development platform for the next generation.General Dynamics boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.2%. GD shares have rallied 7.3% in the past year.Lockheed has more than four decades of experience developing unmanned and robotic systems for the sea. LMT’s Marlin autonomous underwater vehicle system offers a range of civilian and military customers with a quick and safe way to conduct subsea surveys and inspections.Lockheed’s long-term earnings growth rate is 8.4%.

You can skip our detailed analysis on how countries are racking up their defense capabilities amid military escalation in Ukraine and its impact on the armaments industry by heading over to the 10 Strongest Armies in the World in 2023.Plenty has unfolded in the last three years. Azerbaijan has seized parts of the Nagorno-Karabakh region from Armenia, Afghanistan has fallen to the Taliban, there are regular border skirmishes between China and India, Russia’s war in Ukraine is nearing 600 days of conflict, and if that was not it, the Middle East has gone up in flames once more with already thousands killed after Palestinian group Hamas’ attack on Israel, which was followed by Tel Aviv ordering aerial strikes on the Gaza strip.These events have forced several countries, especially those in Europe, to increase their defense spendings to bolster national security. According to figures shared by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), global defense spending was estimated to be $2.2 trillion in 2022, with Europe having its steepest rise in 30 years. The United States, China, and Russia account for more than half of all global spending. NATO countries’ defense expenditure was up 0.9% in 2022 year on year, to total $1.2 trillion last year.The surge in spending has created a boom for armament manufacturers. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) generated $66 billion in revenues and net earnings of $5.7 billion in 2022. It is the largest federal defense contractor in the United States, having received over 11% of all DoD spending in 2022, including a $950 million missile order from the Pentagon to refill stockpiles in Ukraine. A number of countries are also equipping their air force with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 fifth-generation fighter jet. You can read more on this in our article, Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023.Story continuesThis year, the company’s financial performance is even better, as noted by Chairman and CEO, Jim Taiclet, in Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s Q2 2023 Earnings Call:Our Q2 financial results were strong, with sales of $16.7 billion up 8% year-over-year and double-digit growth at both aeronautics and space. Backlog reached a record level of $158 billion, up $8 billion from year-end resulting from a book-to-bill of $1.7 in the quarter. Orders included an approximately $8 billion option of [Indiscernible] for the 126 F-35 for production lot 17 as well as significant awards to ramp up emissions [Ph] at MSC.This highest ever backlog gives us visibility into multi-year sales of our key programs and enables our suppliers to be better positioned to meet growing demand. Segment operating profit of $1.9 million in the quarter reflected an operating margin of 11.1%. Free cash flow was $771 million and we remain committed to advancing technology and expanding production capacity. So in Q2, we invested $356 million of company funded R&amp;D and $329 million of capital expenditures to address our customer’s needs and requirements. Meanwhile, we returned almost two times free cash flow to the shareholders. Given the strong results in the first half of this year, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2023 financial outlook. For sales we’re raising the midpoint of our range by $1 billion to revise expectations of between $66.25 billion to $66.75 billion and free EPS we are raising the midpoint of our range by $0.35, to revise the expectation of between $27 to $27.20 per share.Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX)’s net earnings rose 8.9% from 2021 to total $14.1 billion in 2022. The armament manufacturer won 6.1% of all defense-related contracts from the DoD during the year, including an order worth nearly $1 billion from the U.S. Air Force to develop scramjet-powered hypersonic cruise missiles.Revenues of Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) were also significantly higher in 2022 compared to the previous year. The company is known for its expertise in space and command and control systems. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is also the manufacturer of the strategic bomber B-21 Raider, which is currently under development for use by the U.S. Air Force.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:Our other purchase was Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), a US defense contractor whose stock price experienced a pullback. We like that Northrop has a larger presence than its rivals in the most favorable subcategories of the defense industry-namely, nuclear weapons, space systems, and what’s known as C4ISR (which stands for Command, Control, Communications, Computers. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance). C4ISR refers to digital systems that translate data picked up from different sensors-such as an incoming hypersonic missile or advancing troops-into a common format, and then escalate key information to the right people These differentiated technologies are especially relevant in a time of increased geopolitical tensions. Northrop also benefits from large barriers to entry in this stable industry, which should enable continued strong earnings and cash flow.All being said, recent conflicts have also demonstrated how having large armored, artillery, and infantry units are not enough to gauge a military’s strength. Having an experienced and battle-hardened force, technological advancement in military hardware, and a strong and stable economy are just as important determinants that are often overlooked. Russia, for instance, has the highest number of nuclear weapons, tanks, rocket artillery (MLRS), and self-propelled artillery in the world, and ranks third when it comes to armored fighting vehicles. Despite being a force on paper, it has struggled to find its way in Ukraine in a war that has stretched nearly 600 days with no end in sight.MethodologyWe have ranked the 25 strongest armies in the world by analyzing key metrics pertaining to strength of ground forces, such as active manpower, tanks fleet, armored fighting vehicles, rocket projectors, attack helicopters and nuclear weapons. Collectively, these metrics have been assigned a weight of 50% to determine our rankings. 30% is made up of countries’ military technological capabilities, which is a product of the technological advancement levels of a country coupled with its defense spending. Lastly, we have also considered the sizes of the economies and assigned GDP a 20% weightage. This is a key metric because only a strong economy would be able to sustain a capable ground force over the long run.Data has been sourced from the Global Firepower Index 2023 and our recent articles, 25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023, 50 Largest Economies in the World Ranked by PPP and 25 Most Technologically Advanced Countries in the World in 2022.25 Strongest Armies in the World in 2023Photo by Joel Rivera-Camacho on UnsplashLet’s now head over to the list of the strongest armies in the world in 2023.25.

Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Lockheed Martin (LMT) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $6.67 a share, just four days from its upcoming earnings release on October 17, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $6.67 Most Accurate Estimate and the $6.66 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Lockheed Martin has an Earnings ESP of 0.15%.LMT is one of just a large database of Aerospace stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is RTX (RTX).Slated to report earnings on October 24, 2023, RTX holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.19 a share 11 days from its next quarterly update.For RTX, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 is 0.2%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, LMT and RTX could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Smith",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-bank-110900672.html,1697195340,STORY,"['LMT', 'RPM', 'AOS', 'MCD', 'OZK']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 13, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Bank OZK OZK, McDonald's Corp. MCD, RPM International Inc. RPM, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT and A. O. Smith Corp. AOS.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Stocks in Focus on Their Recent Dividend HikeWall Street started October with a volatile trading pattern like the last two months. The Fed kept the benchmark lending rate unchanged at the existing 5.25-5.5% range at its September FOMC meeting. Market participants were widely expecting a status quo. However, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell created uncertainty among investors.Although the Fed paused its rate hike in the September FOMC meeting, the current dot plot has shown a strong likelihood of one more hike of 25 basis points in 2023. That will take the terminal interest rate of this hiking cycle to 5.6%, well above the 5.1% forecast in June. Notably, the current range of the Fed fund rate is the highest level since March 2001.More importantly, the central bank said it would keep interest rates higher for a longer time. The new projection has shown two rate cuts in 2024 instead of four projected in June. The first cut in interest rate is not expected before September 2024.Moreover, the unresolved war between Russia and Ukraine and the recent geopolitical conflict between Israel and the Palestine-based terrorist group Hamas may inject more volatility in the near future.Stocks to WatchAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolios. We believe one should consider stocks that have recently raised their dividend payments.Five such companies are — Bank OZK, McDonald's Corp., RPM International Inc.,Lockheed Martin Corp. and A. O.

News Corp declined to comment and Starboard did not respond to a request for comment.News Corp's shares were down 1.8% in premarket trading on Monday, after closing with small gains Friday after the Starboard news.

The company is likely to record top and bottom-line growth when it posts third-quarter results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.43 per share, suggesting growth of 7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. The consensus estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $1.14 billion, indicating a rise of 3.7% from the year-ago quarter’s actual.In the last reported quarter, the company posted an earnings surprise of 8%. SNA has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.3%, on average.Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Snap-On Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Snap-On Incorporated QuoteKey Factors to NoteSnap-on has been focused on several growth strategies. These include enhancing the franchise network, improving relationships with repair shop owners and managers, and expanding into critical industries in emerging markets.Our model estimates sales growth of 1.6% for Commercial &amp; Industrial Group, 3% for Snap-on Tools Group, and 4.4% for Repair Systems &amp; Information Group in the third quarter. We expect year-over-year consolidated organic revenue growth of 4% for the third quarter, driven by a 3.6% rise in Commercial &amp; Industrial Group, 4% growth in Snap-on Tools Group, and 5.4% growth in Repair Systems &amp; Information Group.The company's emphasis on its Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) process has been aimed at enhancing organizational effectiveness, reducing costs, and boosting sales and margins. Savings from the RCI initiative come from continuous productivity and process improvement plans. The company has also been investing in new products and increasing brand awareness globally.Management is dedicated to harnessing its strengths within the automotive repair sector and extending its customer reach, with a particular emphasis on automotive repair and vital industries. With these strategies in place, the company anticipates a capital expenditure of $100 million in 2023.We expect SNA’s gross margin to expand 90 basis points (bps) to 49.2% in the third quarter, while the operating margin is likely to expand 30 bps year over year to 26.6%.However, Snap-on has been facing ongoing challenges due to macroeconomic headwinds, which will likely persist throughout 2023. The company has been grappling with the impacts of rising cost inflation, primarily driven by increased raw material expenses and other related costs. These factors are expected to have partly hurt the company's profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.We expect the company’s operating expenses to increase 4.3% year over year to $322.4 million in the third quarter mainly due to elevated costs. As a percentage of sales, we expect operating expenses to increase 50 bps year over year to 28.5% in the third quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Snap-on this time around.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on Snap-on's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Snap-on How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Snap-on is:21% = US$998m ÷ US$4.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.21 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Snap-on's Earnings Growth And 21% ROETo start with, Snap-on's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 14%. This certainly adds some context to Snap-on's decent 9.0% net income growth seen over the past five years.We then performed a comparison between Snap-on's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 8.2% in the same 5-year period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is SNA worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether SNA is currently mispriced by the market.Is Snap-on Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Snap-on has a three-year median payout ratio of 34%, which implies that it retains the remaining 66% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Moreover, Snap-on is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 39% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Snap-on's future ROE will be 18% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Snap-on's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

191,3cd10b63-8cb8-3403-a29d-f08810aecb26,TPR,2023-10-14,Meet the CEO behind the huge fashion deal uniting the parent companies of Coach and Michael Kors. Wall Street isn’t sold on it—but Tapestry’s Joanne Crevoiserat says she’s ‘weaving together beautiful things’,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meet-ceo-behind-huge-fashion-120000394.html,1697198400,STORY,"['CPRI', 'TPR']","[Jennifer Lopez was there. Lil Nas X was there. Two mega-stars from overseas—Chinese TV star Wu Jinya and South Korean rapper Youngji Lee—brought traffic to a standstill on Manhattan’s 42nd Street. Even anti-leather runway protesters from PETA crashed their way in.Coach’s New York Fashion Week event, which commandeered the main branch of the New York Public Library for a glamorous night in September, was clearly a hot ticket. But one VIP was conspicuously absent: Joanne Crevoiserat, the CEO of Coach’s parent company, the fashion conglomerate Tapestry.It’s not that Crevoiserat wasn’t interested in the splashiest show by the biggest brand in her company’s portfolio. (Coach accounted for about $5 billion of Tapestry’s $6.7 billion in revenue last year.) But in an industry known for flamboyant, publicity-seeking leaders, Crevoiserat has always eschewed the limelight, preferring a low-key, get-it-done management style.The CEO says she preferred to have her ticket go to a creator in the Coach ranks. “It isn’t my thing, and I want to support our creative teams,” Crevoiserat tells Fortune during an interview at her office in New York’s Hudson Yards. “There’s a lot of work that goes into the runway shows, and creativity is the engine that drives the brands.” She and her adult daughter caught a tennis match instead, from nosebleed seats at the U.S. Open in Queens.Crevoiserat, a retail and apparel industry lifer, is hardly a self-effacing wallflower. Rather, she sees the role of a CEO as that of a behind-the-scenes player who provides direction and cohesion and comes up with the strategy around which the company will coalesce. That’s an especially important role at a portfolio company like Tapestry that is steering multiple brands. She admits she has often had to be persuaded by Tapestry’s communications team to do sit-down interviews like ours.To be sure, publicity has been a double-edged sword for Tapestry’s leaders of late. The company formerly known as Coach renamed itself in 2017 after Coach bought the accessories maker Kate Spade, its biggest-ever acquisition at that point, and announced plans to become a portfolio company. (Tapestry also owns the shoe brand Stuart Weitzman.) Problems with integrating Kate Spade cost one Tapestry CEO his job in 2019; less than a year later, the board pushed out the next CEO amid a controversy over his personal behavior.Story continuesCrevoiserat, who became CEO in October 2020 after three months as interim chief, inherited a company in turmoil after those very public ousters: Overlaid on the CEO turnover was the pandemic, which hurt luxury spending and isolated workers from each other. Since then, she’s been a stable, patient presence, and a leader whose primary mission has been instilling a more cohesive culture at Tapestry–one that combines some of the advantages of scale, like operating efficiencies and a wider range of career opportunities, with a respect for individual brands’ personalities and ways of operating. Like just about every other retail CEO of her generation, she’s also been overhauling Tapestry’s tech infrastructure–successfully, most analysts agree.Crevoiserat will need every skill in her toolkit to help her successfully pull off Tapestry’s recently announced $8.5 billion purchase of its arch-rival, Capri Holdings. Capri is home to Michael Kors, Versace and Jimmy Choo—all names that rival Coach and Kate Spade in the luxury category. The deal will double Tapestry by annual revenue to about $12 billion and make it a true portfolio company with six separate brands. (It’s the largest U.S. retail M&amp;A deal since department store operator Federated bought rival May Department Stores in 2005.)Tapestry announced the Capri deal in August, making the case that the two companies, despite some similarities among their brands, are complementary. But Wall Street isn’t buying it: Many analysts see the deal as risky, and Tapestry’s shares are down 30% since the announcement.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comPart of the skepticism stems from what one might call turnaround fatigue. Tapestry spent the second half of the 2010s rehabilitating Coach after a few very painful years during which the brand became overextended and cheapened; it then pulled off a similar fixer-upper job for Kate Spade that dragged on. Now investors worry that Tapestry could again be facing a long slog in continuing Capri’s overhaul of Michael Kors—which, like Coach, is by far the biggest brand in its parent’s stable. Michael Kors is famed for the jet-set, blingy aura that made its ready-to-wear lines big business, but its cachet has been severely damaged by years of overexposure, the kind of market saturation that leads to too much presence at discount stores and outlet malls.In a research note, Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow pointed to the ample M&amp;A failures in retail, and said of the Capri deal that Michael Kors’s shaky status “adds real execution risk.”  Paul Lejuez at Citi was more blunt: “TPR has not had a great track record of making and integrating acquisitions,” he wrote in a research note, though he did acknowledge Crevoiserat and her team had had more success than previous c-suites had, and that Tapestry was paying a reasonable price for Capri.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comIn addition, the deal will also dramatically increase Tapestry’s complexity. “It’s a lot to digest,” says Neil Saunders, a managing director at GlobalData. “Tapestry is buying a company that is in need of a lot of work and that it basically has to turn around.” That makes it a formidable test for Crevoiserat—an executive who has already shown that she can project calm amid the industry’s storms.Cool in times of crisisFor much of her life, becoming a CEO in the fashion world was nowhere on Crevoiserat’s radar screen. The Connecticut native, who grew up in Groton, not far from the Rhode Island border on Long Island Sound, is an accountant by training. She was tempted by law school when she finished college in 1985, but daunted by the cost, she decided to go work in retail, thinking it would be a brief interlude after which she’d get her MBA and “get a real job.” But her just-out-of-school gig at May Department Stores led her to undergo that company’s management trainee program; later, she worked at Walmart and Kohl’s.Those experiences exposed Crevoiserat to many facets of retailing, from anti-theft measures to planning and allocation. Combined with her accounting training, it foretold her future as CFO at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, where she worked from 2014 to 2019 before joining Tapestry as CFO.In hindsight, Crevoiserat says, her path to CFO roles was unconventional. Typically, someone eyeing a finance chief role will start with a stint as an accountant at a “Big Four” firm like PwC, or at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Still, Crevoiserat allows that even in other roles she has kept the discipline and focus on cost-control typical of finance chiefs. “You can take the girl out of the CFO role but you can’t take the CFO out of the girl,” she jokes.Her versatility in roles other than CFO may be the key to her success as CEO. Crucially, she was the top lieutenant to Abercrombie CEO Fran Horowitz in co-designing and executing the company’s long but ultimately wildly successful turnaround–during which Crevoiserat also held the role of chief operating officer. Abercrombie in the early 2010s had seen sales plummet and, in Mike Jeffries, had a CEO who had created a toxic culture at the retailer prior to his ouster in 2014. One of Crevoiserat’s earliest moves as CFO was to get rid of Abercrombie’s private jet, which had become a symbol of excess: On top of being expensive, it made headlines when media reports said that Jeffries had implemented imperious rules such as demanding that the jet’s flight attendants be young, buffed, and shirtless.Abercrombie’s CEO office sat unoccupied for more than two years, with an “Office of the Chairman” that included Horowitz and Crevoiserat to do the job while the board’s search committee looked for someone to save the deeply damaged corporation. Yet Crevoiserat says didn’t feel she was the right person for the CEO position at the time, since she believed CEOs by definition had big personalities. She recalls being asked by Abercrombie’s then-chairman Arthur Martinez, a former Sears CEO, why she hadn’t tossed her hat in the ring. “I said, ‘I’m not sure I’m the CEO type,” she recalls. After Martinez told her that there was no single “CEO type,” she still didn’t apply.But in the back of her mind, she says, she started to rethink her view that CEOs had to be larger than life, or at least very much out there. By the time the Tapestry board tapped her to be interim CEO in 2020, she felt more than ready for the role.Her arrival came at a time of crisis. CEO Jide Zeitlin had replaced Victor Luis less than a year earlier; Luis lost his job in part because of how big a drag on the company the Kate Spade acquisition was turning out to be. Zeitlin, who had been a Coach director since 2006, was then ousted because of allegations of past inappropriate behavior; in particular, one woman accused him of posing as a photographer under an alias in 2007 to lure her into a romantic relationship. That left Crevoiserat, a rookie CEO, to deal with a troika of problems: reassuring a workforce rattled by the management turnover; navigating a pandemic during which consumers did not need Tapestry’s handbags and shoes; and bringing the Kate Spade brand back to health.Crevoiserat now recognizes that Tapestry made strategic mistakes with Kate Spade after buying it in 2017. Tapestry pushed the brand to trade its relatively joyful ethos, anchored in novelty and crazy colors, for a more muted, sophisticated color palette—a move that effaced what made Kate Spade stand out among countless handbag brands. “At Kate, we walked away from some of that core DNA and we effectively fired our customer,” she says.Under Crevoiserat’s leadership, Tapestry has gone back to letting Kate be Kate. The business bounced back strongly from the pandemic (although sales fell 2% last year, in a reminder of how exposed to consumer pullbacks “aspirational” luxury brands like Kate Spade can be). That approach represents Crevoiserat’s broader support of autonomy among Tapestry’s brands: The chief exec and her fellow c-suite officers keep apprised of what the creative teams are up to, but won’t intervene unless they see something wildly off brand. “While I don't weigh in on the creativity, I'm there for those teams,” Crevoiserat says, “and I want to make sure that we're allowing them to drive the creative process in a way that helps move the brands forward.”Crevoiserat says that just before the one-two punch of the pandemic and the CEO crisis, Tapestry was about to launch a transformation program that she and Zeitlin were to lead. COVID shut down a huge chunk of its store fleet for weeks, which in turn fueled the need for that transformation: The pandemic underscored how necessary modernizing its tech and e-commerce was, along with the importance of adopting a less top-down culture to foster agility on the front lines. And her time co-piloting the Abercrombie turnaround would prove to be very handy to her: “Frankly, it could create a case for change in the organization that was compelling,” the CEO says of the perfect storm of crises at Tapestry.A chance to do luxury at scaleFor all of Crevoiserat’s low-key style, she will soon be the author of one of biggest luxury sector deals ever in the U.S. Capri, with 2022 revenue of $5.7 billion, is almost as large as Tapestry. Many on Wall Street were stunned by the deal, not least by the $8 billion in bridge-financing debt Tapestry will take on to finalize it.There is also some PTSD in the investor community after Tapestry’s years-long Kate Spade struggles—and related questions about whether Tapestry will be able to fix Michael Kors, which generates 69% of revenue at Capri, as fast and effectively as investors would like given the debt burden. The $3.88 billion the Kors brand pulled in in 2022 is still well below its $4.5 billion high water mark in 2016. And it isn’t helping that business is slowing in North America for both Tapestry and Capri.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comStill, Crevoiserat professes to be baffled by Wall Street’s reaction to the deal. “This acquisition was so completely obvious that it surprised me how many people were surprised,” she says.She posits that the companies are complimentary. Capri, for example, is better established in Europe. In Versace and Jimmy Choo, it has a bigger presence in the world of high luxury than Tapestry’s brands; and in Kors it has a jet set brand popular with shoppers younger and more diverse than Coach’s. In return, Tapestry’s Asia business is much bigger, and it is a powerhouse in leather goods, notably handbags.Tapestry also has a tech backbone that Capri lacks. It has invested in an infrastructure of systems, which the company calls ""Toro,"" that helps all its brands manage inventory better. Toro also fuels better marketing and guides new product development, by generating deep insights into consumers’ behavior. Toro, in turn, serves a long-standing effort by Tapestry to become much less dependent on department stores with all their problems, and to sell a greater percentage of its products via its own stores and websites. E-commerce is now a $2 billion business for Tapestry, accounting for almost a third of revenues. Crevoiserat says the company has also created a more efficient cost structure at Tapestry that she says will save the combined company $200 million a year when the deal closes.Another big rationale for the deal is that, well, everyone else is consolidating. As evidenced by the growth in the last twenty years of European luxury giants LVMH, Kering, and Richemont, upscale brands often thrive as part of a larger company with bigger resources, and clout with suppliers, than as stand-alone companies.For all its problems, Kate Spade illustrates the potential of that idea. After the Tapestry acquisition, the brand was able to get better prices for leather than it was on its own. “When you are buying for several brands, you get better negotiating power and that’s another big advantage that these luxury conglomerates can have,” says Columbia Business School professor Silvia Bellezza, who once worked at LVMH in marketing. As Coach brand CEO Todd Kahn puts it: “We want to have the power of a $12 billion enterprise when we’re procuring everything from toilet paper for our stores to negotiating leather supplies.” (Tapestry execs insist that the idea of the deal is not to create a North American counterpart to LVMH. LVMH’s portfolio, for one thing, is an order of magnitude bigger, with about 75 brands in fashion, jewelry, beauty products and alcohol, and $90 billion in revenue.)Tapestry’s management is also committed to avoiding any growth-at-all-costs mindset. Overextension hurt Coach in the 2010s: There were too many models of handbags, too many “C” Coach logos slapped on its products at a time of a backlash against logos among consumers, and too much reliance on outlet stores. Coach closed 25% of its stores in one fell swoop in 2014, dialed back its discount outlet business, and eventually ended up removing half the products in its cluttered assortment.Over the same span, Coach hired Stuart Vevers, the lauded designer who has since then turned Coach into a fashion house known for shearling coats and leather pants as well as accessories, and enough of a serious fashion force to attract the likes of Jenny from the Block to Coach’s shows. “We stopped undervaluing our product and we started to create more fashion credibility,” says Kahn, a longtime Coach and Tapestry veteran.Tapestry later had to do similar work on Kate Spade. Now it faces similar challenges at MIchael Kors, which is present at high-retailers like Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom, but also at T.J. Maxx and countless other outlet stores.Tapestry executives dismiss the criticism from some analysts that Michael Kors will turn out to be a troublesome acquisition. Tapestry’s finance chief, Scott Roe, says that the due diligence he and Crevoiserat conducted included in-depth assessments of each Capri brand’s reputation with consumers. “We wanted to make sure we weren’t buying brands that had health issues we thought were significant,” says Roe. Brand equity was one of two red lines for Tapestry in looking at the potential acquisition; the other was whether it would jeopardize Tapestry’s investment grade debt rating. “There’s a lot of debt. Let’s acknowledge the reality about this transaction. But it’s also a lot of cash flow,” says Roe, who came to be CFO from VF, the brand portfolio company that owns The North Face and Vans, among others.Whatever misgivings Wall Street has about the deal and the financing, investors do have faith in Tapestry’s c-suite. Telsey Advisory Group wrote in a note that “we view TPR management as well suited for the strategic and financial work ahead.”Crevoiserat’s fine-tuned sense of corporate culture will be one key to making this mega-deal work. The CEO will have to find the balance of fostering an atmosphere that unifies the company and its employees, while allowing the brands—all stand-alone companies not long ago, with their own ethoses and ways of doing things—to keep their internal identities.  “The cultural side is going to be very important because I think the key to a lot of this is actually integrating all these brands,” says GlobalData’s Saunders.A big part of that integration, for Crevoiserat, means cultivating talent with a promise of wider opportunity: At a portfolio company like Tapestry, people can have a thriving career that can move across different brands. She emphasizes having an inclusive and diverse workforce, as well. And Tapestry is very focused on sustainability—another priority that benefits from scale, given that many functions that affect the company’s carbon footprint, like procurement and lease negotiation, will be shared across brands.'We're building here'The name Tapestry itself was not beloved at first by executives or Wall Street when it was introduced six years ago to replace Coach. But Crevoiserat has come to think it applies well both to the company and to her own role. Her job, she says, “is about weaving together beautiful things and making a more beautiful story, and that’s what a tapestry is.”Perhaps that’s why Crevoiserat doesn’t see herself as a dealmaker, despite being the CEO who pushed for the largest U.S. fashion deal in decades. “It’s the right thing for our business,” she says. “When I hear the term ‘dealmaker,’ I think, ‘Your job is to buy this one, sell that one.’ We’re building here, and I’d rather be a brand-builder and a talent-builder than a dealmaker.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

The average miss was 192.1%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for Alcoa this earnings season.Alcoa Price and EPS SurpriseAlcoa Price and EPS SurpriseAlcoa price-eps-surprise | Alcoa QuoteFactors to NoteAlcoa’s third-quarter results are expected to be hurt by lower alumina production due to curtailment of production in the Kwinana refinery, reduced production in Australian refineries and unplanned equipment maintenance at the Alumar refinery. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for alumina production indicates a 1% dip from the year-ago reported number.Despite an anticipated increase in shipments due to increased trading activity, lower production may weigh on Alumina segment’s third-party sales in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The consensus mark for Alumina segment’s third-party sales implies an approximate 8% decline from the year-ago reported number.The Aluminum segment is expected to put up a weak show on softer billet demand. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-party Aluminum segment sales suggests a 14.5% decline from the third-quarter 2022 reported figure.However, raw material and production costs are likely to support AA’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alcoa this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here, as elaborated below.Earnings ESP: Alcoa has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of $1.13.

Charles Schwab Director of Trading and Education Joe Mazzola joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the report.“What we saw was really a rotation… maybe away from some of the economically sensitive areas, discretionaries being one of those, and movements into a little bit more of a defensive standpoint,” Mazzola says. “My biggest takeaway was really the fact that clients were very selective in their purchases... it was really more driven by movement into certain names,” including Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA).For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Well, TD Ameritrade's investor movement index saw a dip in September as it proved to be a challenging month for investors. Bond yields rose to their highest levels in nearly two decades. And the S&amp;P 500 struggling with losses. But TD Ameritrade clients still found themselves as net buyers of equities. Here to break this all down, we've got Joe Mazzola, Charles Schwab Director of Trading and Education. Good to talk to you today. So still net buyers, even with the choppiness that we saw in the market, where are investors going?JOE MAZZOLA: Yeah, thanks for having me. You know, I think what is insightful about this report is it aggregates what clients are actually doing, right? What they're doing with their positions and their activities. And so what we saw was really a rotation, if you will, a rotation maybe away from some of the economically sensitive areas, discretionaries being one of those, and movements into a little bit more of a defensive standpoint.We saw that movement into health care. But I think my biggest takeaway was really the fact that clients were very selective in their purchases. It wasn't index or ETF buying that was really driving this. It was really more driven by movement into certain names. And some of those names would include Apple, NVIDIA. And these are names that, even in an economically sensitive regime, these are names that have good balance sheets.Story continuesThey have access to cash. They have good net interest coverage ratios. And so these are some of those the factor analysis that I think are astute investors were looking for.AKIKO FUJITA: Joe, you know what always surprises me about these surveys is is regardless of where the market is, you've got these banner names that investors often turn to. Apple one that you just mentioned, Nvidia another one. What about somebody like Tesla?JOE MAZZOLA: Well. We've seen that before, right? We've seen that before where they've moved into that name. I think what we did-- the reason we didn't see that necessarily in September was just kind of the move out of consumer discretionary as a whole. Tesla being a rather large component within that sector.I think the biggest selling we really saw was kind of in leisure and hospitality. We saw that in terms of names like-- affirm in terms of financing that cost. We saw an Airbnb, those were big net sellers, as well, too. So those were the names that they kind of moved away from. Tesla just didn't really move the needle in September as much as it has in prior months.]"

200,4b9f6e2c-81ab-3d20-8dcf-5ef9070cb9e8,NVDA,2023-10-14,Nokia (NOK) Unveils Advanced 25G PON Sealed Fiber Access Node,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nokia-nok-unveils-advanced-25g-160400185.html,1697213040,STORY,"['NOKIA.HE', 'NVDA', 'ANET', 'MSI']","[Nokia Corporation NOK recently introduced the industry’s first 25G PON (Passive Optical Network) technology for Lightspan SF-8M sealed fiber access node. These sealed fiber access nodes are vital components of fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) networks, directly linking high-speed fiber optic cable to individual residences or businesses.With Nokia’s Quillion chipset at its core, the Lightspan SF offers a fiber access node that delivers high throughput and low latency with exceptional deployment flexibility. It can be easily mounted on a stand, on a pole, on a wall, or inside or outside a cabinet. High adaptability and easy installation process of remote FTTH nodes empower operators to swiftly capitalize on commercial opportunities and maximize revenue potential.Its passive cooling feature ensures energy efficiency and minimizes the risk of power failure. The solution supports a wide range of powering options, such as redundant coax or triple power (AC, DC and RFT-V).  Carriers often face various difficulties in today’s ever-changing market dynamics. With the growing proliferation of high data-intensive applications, demand for higher bandwidth and improved service reliability is rising among both residential and enterprise customers. However, frequent upgradation of the system is a costly endeavor.The multigigabit sealed fiber access node is optimized for a wide array of PON technologies, including GPON, XGS-PON, Multi-PON and 25G PON. This enables cable operators to rapidly match the changing bandwidth demand and stay ahead of the competition. Along with unmatched capacity, this 25G PON seamlessly facilitates various commercial use cases, including network slicing, symmetrical 10 Gb/s enterprise services, mobile transport and more.The large centralized OLTs (optical line terminals) often face difficulties related to high latency, and congestion and any single point failure can lead to widespread service disruptions. Remote, small OLTs can reduce latency by bringing the network closer to end users and enhancing performance. It also boosts network resilience, as failure in a particular location won’t affect the whole system. Moreover, it offers operators more flexibility in terms of scaling and upgrading, making them a cost-efficient option for network expansion.Nokia boasts a leadership position in the XGS-PON equipment market, with its solutions powering a significant portion of fiber broadband connections in North America. The company’s proactive approach to quickly identify loopholes in the legacy systems and encourage rapid innovation to address client’s concerns will likely enhance  its commercial horizon.The company is driving the transition of global enterprises into smart virtual networks by creating a single network for all services, converging mobile and fixed broadband, IP routing and optical networks with the software and services to manage them. Leveraging state-of-the-art technology, it is transforming the way people and things communicate and connect with each other.Nokia aims to create new business and licensing opportunities in the consumer ecosystem. To strengthen its leading position in the market, Nokia facilitates its customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations by offering easy programmability and flexible automation needed to support dynamic operations, reduce complexity and improve efficiency.

However, the Middle East is expected to be the fastest growing market for pharmaceutical drugs.Evolving Trends in the IndustryThe pharmaceutical industry has been subject to external factors such as supply chain pressures in addition to rising inflation which has introduced additional costs of labor, raw materials, and transportation. Ever since the pandemic hit the industry, workers have been expecting more work flexibility which adds to the burden of already existing technical labor shortages for pharmaceutical companies. Hence, pharmaceutical companies are finding ways to leverage their positions by innovating, enhancing digitization, and collaborating with strategic partners across the industry. In October 2022, McKinsey reported that one way to leverage market position in the industry has been to enter joint ventures and partnerships. More than 50% of pharmaceutical companies expect to increase collaborations across the industry.On January 6, PwC reported the emerging trends in the pharmaceutical industry for 2023. Pharmaceutical companies are trying to be cost-effective by achieving economies of scale through centralized operations. Outsourcing non-core processes to third parties has also been noticed since these third parties are capable of providing innovative solutions.

The robust preliminary results drove up the company’s shares by 1.5% in the after-hours trading session.The company is scheduled to release third-quarter results on Nov 1, after the closing bell.Per the preliminary report, third-quarter 2023 total revenues are estimated to be $738 million-$744 million on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $650.1 million lies below the preliminary figure.The company’s respiratory product revenues are expected to be in the range of $181 million-$184 million, while the non-respiratory product revenues are anticipated to be in the range of $557 million-$560 million.Per management, the uptick in third-quarter revenues was primarily driven by strong demand for QuidelOrtho’s retail and point-of-care offerings on the back of the presence of influenza and new variants of COVID-19 across the Northern Hemisphere during the to-be-reported period. Management is also upbeat about QuidelOrtho’s continued strength in its non-respiratory businesses and all of its regions (including China) meeting or exceeding its expectations. This raises our optimism about the stock.GuidanceQuidelOrtho has reiterated its full-year guidance provided during its second-quarter 2023 earnings release.Total revenues are continued to be expected to lie in the range of $2.88 billion-$3.08 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.97 billion.Non-respiratory revenues are continued to be expected between $2.27 billion and $2.31 billion (up 5-6.5% at CER from 2022 levels).Respiratory revenues for the full year are continued to be expected to lie in the range of $610 million-$775 million. The respiratory revenues continue to include COVID-19-related revenues of $300 million-$400 million.Adjusted EPS is continued to be expected to lie between $4.85 and $5.30. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.00.A Brief Q3 AnalysisOn the second-quarter earnings call in August, QuidelOrtho’s management confirmed that the Labs instrument supply issues were expected to continue to improve as it moves through the second half of the year. This, along with the continued recovery in China, are expected to have driven the non-respiratory revenue uptick in the Labs segment.Story continuesAt the time of the release of the preliminary third-quarter 2023 results, management stated that the earlier-than-expected arrival of respiratory illnesses has been driving greater demand for QuidelOrtho’s diagnostics. This has raised management’s optimism, which now anticipates the third-quarter performance to be higher than its original expectations. Management reiterated its outlook for 2023 on the back of the pull-forward of the typical respiratory seasonality into the third quarter from the fourth quarter. Management’s confidence in QuidelOrtho’s strategic plan and ability to achieve its full-year financial guidance also look promising for the company.In September, QuidelOrtho announced that it had been granted a CLIA Waiver by the FDA, which applies to its new Sofia 2 SARS Antigen+ FIA (fluorescent immunoassay). The Sofia 2 SARS Antigen+ FIA is now the first rapid antigen test to receive a CLIA waiver. This looks promising for the stock.The company’s preliminary projection of robust improvement in revenues on the back of strength in its businesses lifts our confidence about the stock.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 12.3% between Jul 3 and Oct 1, 2023 compared with the industry’s 10.8% decline and the S&amp;P 500’s 3.2% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, QuidelOrtho carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Boston Scientific Corporation BSX, McKesson Corporation MCK and Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR.Boston Scientific, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 12.8%.

Disney's date-based park tickets – which the company says is what most guests purchase – remain unchanged, however.Disney World prices for parking rose by $5, from $25 to $30, which the company said is “on par with other theme parks in Central Florida.”At Disneyland in Anaheim, California, the increases were more significant. While the lowest-price option for single-day admission remained the same, all other options increased by $5 to $15, or about 4% to 9%.Multi-day tickets increased by $25 to $65, or about 8% to 16%, and the park-hopper add-ons to these tickets increased by $5 to $15, or about 8% to 25%.

The cost of Hulu without ads also went up to $17.99 per month from $14.99, while Hulu with ads remained at $7.99.All the increases follow the company's announcement last month that it plans to double capital expenditures to roughly $60 billion over about 10 years to enhance its parks and cruise line capacity.Story continues“We’re incredibly mindful of the financial underpinning of the company, the need to continue to grow in terms of bottom line, the need to invest wisely so that we’re increasing the returns on invested capital, and the need to maintain a balance sheet, for a variety of reasons,” CEO Bob Iger said at the time. “The company is able to absorb those costs and continue to grow the bottom line and look expansively at how we return value and capital to our shareholders.”Related ContentBeware Fake Disney Plus EmailsGet Disney Plus for Less — with adsFive Ways To a Cheap Last-Minute Vacation]"

206,f08235ac-276f-317c-9b9c-2f0939dd0ce6,DIS,2023-10-14,"Months after DeSantis stripped Disney of a special district, Universal Orlando Resort just got one",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/months-desantis-stripped-disney-special-152753501.html,1697210873,STORY,['DIS'],"[Just months after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis stripped Disney of its self-governing status, a neighboring theme park has been granted many of the same benefits.The Orange County Board of County Commissioners unanimously voted earlier this week to create a special district for the 719 acres encompassing Universal Orlando Resort and its ongoing expansion. Taxes and fees collected in that area will fund the district. All land is owned by either Universal Orlando or the company that owns the Hilton Orlando adjacent to the park.The special district will reportedly use $174 million in bonds to fund infrastructure, including a planned rail service station connecting the Orlando airport to an area near the park.The train is the key part of the deal. Officials are concerned about traffic inflow to the area with the forthcoming expansion of Universal. (Disney, also, is planning to expand its parks.) The new line would also link to the Orange County Convention Center.All of the board seats for the special district will be held by Universal employees. That’s far different from the Reedy Creek Improvement District, which oversees Walt Disney World and other Disney theme parks in Florida. The board overseeing that area was taken over by DeSantis allies after the state dissolved Reedy Creek’s special status.That could add a new twist to the ongoing legal battle between Disney and DeSantis. The entertainment giant has alleged the governor’s actions were retaliation against Disney for the company exercising its First Amendment rights in opposing the state’s “Don’t Say Gay” law.The law, which was signed by DeSantis in March 2022, prohibits teachers from discussing sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade classrooms. Supporters of the legislation argue that it allows parents to broach LGBTQ+ topics to their children in their own way and time, while critics—who coined the term ""Don't Say Gay""—argue it will hurt young LGBTQ+ children, who already face greater health and suicide risks compared to their cisgender or straight peers.Story continuesAfter the bill was signed into law, Disney released a public statement saying ""the 'Don't Say Gay' bill should never have passed,"" and vowed to work to have it repealed.The company's stance set off a firestorm of criticism from conservatives who accused Disney of being too ""woke.” DeSantis soon revoked the park's self-governing status, slashing the company's diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and attempting to strip its employees of their free passes and discounts.Disney claimed that the crackdown amounted to illegal harassment of a law-abiding business, and sued the governor in April.“A targeted campaign of government retaliation—orchestrated at every step by Governor DeSantis as punishment for Disney’s protected speech—now threatens Disney’s business operations, jeopardizes its economic future in the region, and violates its constitutional rights,” Disney claimed.The company narrowed the suit in September to just a free speech claim, alleging “weaponization of government.”But DeSantis, who is seeking the GOP's presidential nomination, has come under fire from free-market Republican donors for targeting corporations like Disney, calling it his ""fatal error.""This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

The new deal will also see TikTok offering Disney a dedicated destination within the video app where Disney fans can watch videos from Disney's brands, create their own with Disney's music and special effects, play Disney-themed trivia, and collect ""Character Cards"" of their favorite players.The company describes this content hub as a ""first-of-its-kind,"" suggesting its Disney partnership stretched beyond Premiere Pulse, where it's now one of the largest Pulse Premiere publishers, to include special accommodations -- and potentially setting the stage for similar large brand partnerships in TikTok's future.The deal came about to help Disney mark The Walt Disney Company's 100th anniversary, which called for a special celebration across social media. Disney remarked on its decision to work with TikTok -- an app still facing government scrutiny and lawsuits over its ties to China and addictive nature -- noting it had to do with TikTok's reach. Explained Asad Ayaz, chief brand officer of The Walt Disney Company, in an announcement, Disney's portfolio of brands and experiences has seen more than 240 billion views on TikTok.This embedded content is not available in your region.https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js""...TikTok has become a go-to destination for Disney fans to create, engage and connect around their favorite Disney films, shows characters and experiences, so we're thrilled to partner with them as we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the company,"" Ayaz said.The Disney activation on TikTok will be extensive, encompassing 48 Disney account handles who will participate for a four-week period across 24 regions around the world starting on October 16. This will include Disney brands highlighting content from Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel, ESPN, National Geographic, Disney Parks and more. Those Disney-run TikTok accounts have a total of over 150 million followers, but that number may grow with this event as TikTok notes fans should ""expect daily reminders"" of why they connected with ""favorite Disney characters, franchises, movies and Disney memories."" This may also prompt users to create more Disney-related content on the platform.Story continuesTo aid with that, Disney and TikTok will also release a Disney100 Playlist for the community which includes popular songs from Disney's catalog, ranging from classics from movies like ""Cinderella"" and ""The Lion King"" to more current songs from ""Toy Story,"" ""High School Musical"" and the upcoming movie ""Wish.""As a Pulse Premiere publisher partner, marketers can run ads in brand-safe slots alongside entertainment and sports content from Disney. Though TikTok offers an endless, personalized feed of content for users to scroll through, Pulse Premiere guarantees the ads will run immediately after what TikTok refers to as ""suitable videos"" from its premium publishing partners. The company had previously partnered with big-name publishes for this offering, including NBCU, Condé Nast, DotDash Meredith, BuzzFeed, Hearst Magazines, Major League Soccer, UFC, Vox Media, and WWE .Because of their placement, TikTok said its users are 2.6x more likely to interact with a Pulse ad versus a comparable ad on other video platforms. It also said that Pulse campaigns increased brand recall by +9.8%, on average, and awareness by +6.8%.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/13/tiktok-scores-sizable-disney-deal-including-a-content-hub-and-publisher-partnership/]"

Sustainability will also be under the executive’s direction.More from Footwear NewsWhy Stephen Curry's New Signature Basketball Shoe Marks the 'Future of Curry'How Under Armour's Stephanie Linnartz Applies Lessons Learned at Marriott to Her New Role“Shawn is a retail industry powerhouse who comes to Under Armour at this critical time with the breadth and depth of experience that we need to optimize the backbone of our business, the supply chain, to ensure that our consumers get the right products, at the right price, at the right time,” said Linnartz in a statement.Curran, who spent 30 decades at Gap Inc., was most recently Old Navy’s COO, where he oversaw 44,000 associates across 1,200 stores and managed end-to-end operations, inventory management and sourcing. Throughout his tenure at the San Francisco apparel giant, he held several roles across the Gap portfolio, including serving as COO and head of global supply chain across all seven of the firm’s brands.For its part, Under Armour has been rolling out a business transformation plan throughout 2023. Linnartz’s Protect This House 3 (PTH 3) plan includes reinvigorating brand DNA, addressing key product areas and accelerating business growth in North America.As part of the strategy, Linnartz has made a series of executive changes and eliminted some roles.

Women in finance tout mentorship and AI as worthwhile diversity efforts, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty emphasizes skill-based hiring, and Fortune senior writer Maria Aspan tells us why a Marriott veteran took a risk to become Under Armour's new CEO. Enjoy your weekend!- Leap of faith. Back in February, when Marriott president Stephanie Linnartz left the hotel chain after 25 years to become the chief executive of sportswear retailer Under Armour, my initial reaction was: “Huh. Yes, it’s a CEO job—but why this one?”So for this year’s Most Powerful Women issue of Fortune, I sat down with Linnartz to ask exactly that question—and to examine the landscape for ambitious, experienced female executives like Linnartz who want to become CEOs, but who still get far fewer opportunities than their male counterparts.“I always had this idea that the rewards of taking risks are, the great majority of the time, worth it,” Linnartz told me in late August, from her sunny new corner office at Under Armour headquarters in Baltimore.After all, she wanted to be a CEO—and when the Under Armour job opened up, “I was ready to take that next leap.”Stephanie Linnartz, President and Chief Executive Officer of Under Armour at their headquarters in Baltimore, MDLinnartz had spent almost her entire career at Marriott, where she climbed to become No. 2 and the most senior woman at the world’s largest hotel chain. At Under Armour, she’s jumping to a struggling and much smaller company—one where she’s effectively the third CEO in four years to work for executive chairman and founder Kevin Plank. The company’s sales growth has stagnated; its share price has plunged 87% from its 2015 high; its once-buzzy brand is seen as anywhere from “inconsistent” (per Linnartz) to “second-tier” (per analysts); and its founder—who “stepped down” as CEO at the start of 2020 but who still owns 65% of the company’s voting shares—continues to land Under Armour in unflattering headlines.So Linnartz is taking on a big turnaround job, on all sorts of fronts. She’s also following her longtime advice to other women on how to advance in corporate America: “Take the toughest, most difficult job or project someone can give you, because that’s how you move ahead,” is how Linnartz described her career philoso­phy to Fortune’s Leigh Gallagher eight years ago.Story continuesTaking on those sorts of jobs doesn’t always go as planned—as we have recently been reminded by the cases of Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino, former Walgreens CEO Roz Brewer, and the broader data-backed phenomenon of the “glass cliff.” But her friends and colleagues are betting that Linnartz is up to the challenge at Under Armour. As Accenture CEO Julie Sweet, No. 2 on this year’s MPW list and a longtime business partner of Linnartz’s, told me: “She knows what the challenges are—and she’s going to absolutely overcome them.”For more of Linnartz’s strategy to do so, read my full profile here.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Comcast (CMCSA) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.97 a share, just 13 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 26, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.97 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.94 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Comcast has an Earnings ESP of 2.55%.CMCSA is one of just a large database of Consumer Discretionary stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is AMC Entertainment (AMC).Slated to report earnings on November 14, 2023, AMC Entertainment holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is -$0.32 a share 32 days from its next quarterly update.For AMC Entertainment, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.41 is 20.99%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, CMCSA and AMC could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at $1.39 per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Marsh &amp; McLennan currently has a Zacks Rank #3.Before we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at MMC’s previous-quarter performance first.Q2 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, this globally leading insurance broker company’s adjusted earnings per share of $2.20 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8%, primarily on the back of strong performance in the Risk and Insurance Services segment, led by the Marsh business' robust international operations. A well-performing Consulting unit also contributed to the upside. However, an elevated expense level acted as a partial offset to the results.Story continuesNow, let us see how things have shaped up prior to the third-quarter earnings announcement.Factors Driving Q3 PerformanceThe third-quarter top-line performance of Marsh &amp; McLennan is anticipated to have been boosted by robust showings in its Risk and Insurance Services, as well as Consulting segments. The Risk and Insurance Services segment is expected to have gained on the back of solid contributions from its Marsh and Guy Carpenter sub-divisions. MMC's performance in the third quarter is likely to have received a significant boost from robust operations in the international market, with a particular focus on Latin America and Asia.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Risk and Insurance Services segment indicates a rise of 11.3% from the prior-year quarter’s level of $2,838 million, whereas our estimate suggests a 12% jump. Also, the consensus mark for the segment’s adjusted operating income suggests an almost 23% increase from the prior-year quarter’s figure of $562 million, whereas our model indicates a nearly 27% rise.The Consulting segment of Marsh &amp; McLennan is anticipated to have gained momentum in the third quarter, driven by the impressive performance of its sub-unit, Oliver Wyman. The performance of the Oliver Wyman sub-unit is likely to have been bolstered by several strategic acquisitions aimed at enhancing its capabilities and expanding its geographic presence. Also, sequentially improving returns from Wealth and Health operations are likely to have aided the Mercer (another sub-unit of the Consulting segment) business in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of the Mercer sub-division indicates a 4.6% increase from the prior-year quarter’s level of $1,284 million, while the same for the Oliver Wyman business' revenues indicates 6% growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the overall Consulting segment’s revenues indicates growth of more than 5% from the prior-year quarter’s $1,951 million, whereas our estimate for the metric suggests a 4.5% rise. Also, the consensus mark for the segment’s adjusted operating income is pegged at $384.8 million, suggesting 6.3% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.The factors stated above are expected to have positioned the company for not only year-over-year growth in the third quarter but also a likely earnings beat. However, the positives are anticipated to be partially offset by increasing expenses. Our estimate for total operating expenses in the quarter under review suggests a 7.6% year-over-year jump.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies worth considering from the broader Finance space, as our model shows that these, too, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Aon plc AON has an Earnings ESP of +1.12% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player.

The consensus estimate for AON’s revenues is pegged at $2.9 billion, suggesting a 6.7% increase from a year ago.Brown &amp; Brown, Inc. BRO has an Earnings ESP of +4.92% and a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Brown &amp; Brown’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 61 cents per share, indicating 22% year-over-year growth.

BJRI third-quarter fiscal 2023 results are likely to increase on a year-over-year basis.In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 56.3% while the revenues missed the same by 0.2%.BJ's Restaurants’ earnings topped the consensus mark in all trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 121.2%.How Are Estimates Placed?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at a loss of 2 cents per share. In the prior-year quarter, BJRI reported a loss per share of 25 cents.BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBJ's Restaurants, Inc. price-eps-surprise | BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Quote For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at nearly $325.4 million, suggesting an increase of 4.5% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.Let's check out the factors, which are likely to have influenced the quarter.Key Factors to NoteRevenuesBJ's Restaurants’ fiscal third-quarter revenues are expected to have increased year over year, attributable to consistent restaurant expansion plans and investments in remodeling initiatives, accompanied by re-staffing and labor retention initiatives. Also, menu innovation strategies and menu pricing add to the growth trend.In the last quarter’s earnings call, the company stated that it has expanded its remodeling initiative to about 35-40 restaurants for fiscal 2023, which is above its original plan of approximately 30 remodels. This expansion was backed by encouraging guest traffic and restaurant profit that BJRI witnessed from its already remodeled restaurants. As of the last quarter, more than 20 remodels have been completed.For the fiscal third quarter, the average weekly sales of BJRI are quite likely to have been driven by remodeling and staffing initiatives along with strategic menu pricing. For the quarter, our model predicts average weekly restaurant sales to be up 3.7% year over year.Considering the above-mentioned tailwinds, we predict comparable restaurant sales to grow 3.9% year over year.MarginsAlthough the ongoing inflationary environment and economic uncertainty are primary concerns, BJ's Restaurants is still likely to witness margin and earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. The company’s customer-focus initiatives, along with cost-saving and labor strategies, are likely to have helped maintain the growth trend in the current economic scenario.For the quarter, the company expects labor inflation to be in mid-single-digits for the to-be-reported quarter. That said, the company’s cost-saving efforts are likely to have aided margin improvement.For the quarter, we expect total cost and expenses to increase 3.9% to $328.8 million compared with the prior-year’s reported increase of 9.5% to $316.5 million. Moreover, gross and adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to rise 12.5% and 6.7% year over year.We also predict restaurant-level operating margin to expand to 12.5% from 10.3%, year over year.Story continuesWhat Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for BJ's Restaurants this time around. The company does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for BJRI is -308.33%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Bank OZK OZK, McDonald's Corp. MCD, RPM International Inc. RPM, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT and A. O. Smith Corp. AOS.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Stocks in Focus on Their Recent Dividend HikeWall Street started October with a volatile trading pattern like the last two months. The Fed kept the benchmark lending rate unchanged at the existing 5.25-5.5% range at its September FOMC meeting. Market participants were widely expecting a status quo. However, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell created uncertainty among investors.Although the Fed paused its rate hike in the September FOMC meeting, the current dot plot has shown a strong likelihood of one more hike of 25 basis points in 2023. That will take the terminal interest rate of this hiking cycle to 5.6%, well above the 5.1% forecast in June. Notably, the current range of the Fed fund rate is the highest level since March 2001.More importantly, the central bank said it would keep interest rates higher for a longer time. The new projection has shown two rate cuts in 2024 instead of four projected in June. The first cut in interest rate is not expected before September 2024.Moreover, the unresolved war between Russia and Ukraine and the recent geopolitical conflict between Israel and the Palestine-based terrorist group Hamas may inject more volatility in the near future.Stocks to WatchAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolios. We believe one should consider stocks that have recently raised their dividend payments.Five such companies are — Bank OZK, McDonald's Corp., RPM International Inc.,Lockheed Martin Corp. and A. O. Smith Corp.. Each of these stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesBank OZK provides various retail and commercial banking services.

It has a dividend yield of 4.2%. Over the past five years, OZK has increased its dividend 20 times, and its payout ratio presently stays at 26% of earnings.

LMT's strong backlog boosts long-term growth. Lockheed Martin is the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs.

With an advantageous location on the Upper New York Bay waterfront and two dock-high and ten grade-level loading positions and off-street parking for 26 cars, the property is likely to lure tenants.Demand for industrial real estate space has been shooting up amid an e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies. Banking on such opportunities, TRNO is expanding its portfolio through acquisitions. The company is targeting functional assets at in-fill locations. Such assets enjoy high population densities and are located near high-volume distribution points.With such expansion efforts, Terreno Realty is well-poised to enhance its portfolio in six major coastal U.S. markets, namely, Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami and Washington, D.C. These markets display solid demographic trends and witness healthy demand for industrial real estate.Most recently, TRNO shelled out $45.7 million to purchase an industrial property in Redondo Beach, CA. Located at 2411 Santa Fe Avenue, the property comprises one industrial transshipment building containing roughly 67,000 square feet and one industrial flex building containing around 45,000 square feet on 6.7 acres.

The company is benefiting from strong demand for its creative products. Adobe’s Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud products are driving the top-line growth. Rising subscription revenues and solid momentum across the mobile apps are major positives.Additionally, growth in emerging markets and robust online video creation demand remain tailwinds. Solid demand for Adobe’s commerce offerings and growing adoption of Acrobat. The Zacks analyst remains optimistic about Adobe’s market position, compelling product lines and continued innovation.However, the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine remain major headwinds for its Digital Media segment. Also, high acquisition expenses do not bode well for its margin expansion.(You can read the full research report on Adobe here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Deere have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry over the past year (+8.4% vs. +7.1%). The company is witnessing solid growth in order levels, which is expected to aid its top-line performance in the forthcoming quarters. Strong replacement demand will continue to boost the company's results.

227,d738c1c1-2fbe-30fc-b5e9-1c0fef1d9dad,AXP,2023-10-14,American Express (AXP) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-express-axp-earnings-expected-140008721.html,1697205608,STORY,"['AXP', 'BX']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when American Express (AXP) reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 20, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis credit card issuer and global payments company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.96 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +19.8%.Revenues are expected to be $15.42 billion, up 13.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.62% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American Express?For American Express, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.60%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that American Express will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that American Express would post earnings of $2.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.89, delivering a surprise of +3.21%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.American Express appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerBlackstone Inc. (BX), another stock in the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.99 for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -6.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.56 billion, down 1.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Blackstone Inc. has been revised 0.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.69%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Blackstone Inc. will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Volatility continues in October as the Fed warned of one more rate hike of 25 basis points by the end of this year and a higher interest rate regime for a longer period. The first rate cut is not expected before September 2024 and the inflation rate is unlikely to decline to the central bank’s target rate of 2% before 2026.However, the inflation rate has been systematically dwindling since its peak in June 2022, barring some minor fluctuations. This indicates that the Fed’s policy of tight monetary control and a higher interest rate regime is finally paying off.Moreover, October is historically known as being favorable to U.S. stock markets. Stocks of several corporate giants with a well-established business model internationally, a robust financial position and globally acclaimed brand recognition are currently available at attractive valuations. Investment in these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should be prudent going forward.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) stocks with attractive valuations.

Top 5 Upgrades:Needham upgraded Applied Materials (AMAT) to Buy from Hold with an $180 price target after the firm rolled out its Wafer Fab Equipment, or WFE, estimates for 2023 and the next two years. The firm sees WFE sales at $90B, $90B and $100B for 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively, noting that its above-consensus call on 2023 WFE accounts for the ""exceptional strength"" of ASML and Chinese Semicap this year.Gordon Haskett upgraded Dollar General (DG) to Buy from Hold with a $140 price target after the company announced that former CEO Todd Vasos would be returning immediately. Vasos has the potential to bring Dollar General ""Back to the Future,"" the analyst tells investors in a research note.UBS analyst Colin Bristow upgraded Immunovant (IMVT) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $55, up from $18.

Solar demand is weak, Israel is at war, there is an inventory correction, a strong dollar is a headwind, and a competitor pre-announced, so ""it is hard to imagine things could get much worse,"" the analyst tells investors.Citi upgraded Oshkosh (OSK) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $115, up from $110. As the machinery sector's earnings revision cycle matures, Oshkosh is an ""outlier"" with earnings momentum accelerating into 2024, Citi says.Top 5 Downgrades:Wolfe Research downgraded Netflix (NFLX) to Peer Perform from Outperform without a price target. The company's 2024 average revenue per user expectations look full while today's paid-sharing net additions will lead to tomorrow's gross adds shortfall, the analyst tells investors in a research note.Morgan Stanley downgraded JD.com (JD) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $33, down from $55.

Macquarie also downgraded JD.com to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $32, down from $52.Oppenheimer downgraded Tractor Supply (TSCO) to Perform from Outperform with a price target of $210, down from $280. Tractor Supply represents one of the most interesting new unit growth, margin expansion opportunities, within mid-cap specialty retail over the long-term, but Oppenheimer is increasingly concerned that shares do not yet discount adequately for a potentially pro-longed, post-pandemic sales expansion lull.BofA double downgraded Outset Medical (OM) to Underperform from Buy with a price target of $3, down from $32. After Outset pre-announced a Q3 revenue miss and lowered 2023 guidance, the firm says Outset has had ""multiple execution missteps now.""Guggenheim downgraded Eversource (ES) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $60, down from $70.

The robust preliminary results drove up the company’s shares by 1.5% in the after-hours trading session.The company is scheduled to release third-quarter results on Nov 1, after the closing bell.Per the preliminary report, third-quarter 2023 total revenues are estimated to be $738 million-$744 million on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $650.1 million lies below the preliminary figure.The company’s respiratory product revenues are expected to be in the range of $181 million-$184 million, while the non-respiratory product revenues are anticipated to be in the range of $557 million-$560 million.Per management, the uptick in third-quarter revenues was primarily driven by strong demand for QuidelOrtho’s retail and point-of-care offerings on the back of the presence of influenza and new variants of COVID-19 across the Northern Hemisphere during the to-be-reported period. Management is also upbeat about QuidelOrtho’s continued strength in its non-respiratory businesses and all of its regions (including China) meeting or exceeding its expectations. This raises our optimism about the stock.GuidanceQuidelOrtho has reiterated its full-year guidance provided during its second-quarter 2023 earnings release.Total revenues are continued to be expected to lie in the range of $2.88 billion-$3.08 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.97 billion.Non-respiratory revenues are continued to be expected between $2.27 billion and $2.31 billion (up 5-6.5% at CER from 2022 levels).Respiratory revenues for the full year are continued to be expected to lie in the range of $610 million-$775 million. The respiratory revenues continue to include COVID-19-related revenues of $300 million-$400 million.Adjusted EPS is continued to be expected to lie between $4.85 and $5.30. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.00.A Brief Q3 AnalysisOn the second-quarter earnings call in August, QuidelOrtho’s management confirmed that the Labs instrument supply issues were expected to continue to improve as it moves through the second half of the year. This, along with the continued recovery in China, are expected to have driven the non-respiratory revenue uptick in the Labs segment.Story continuesAt the time of the release of the preliminary third-quarter 2023 results, management stated that the earlier-than-expected arrival of respiratory illnesses has been driving greater demand for QuidelOrtho’s diagnostics. This has raised management’s optimism, which now anticipates the third-quarter performance to be higher than its original expectations. Management reiterated its outlook for 2023 on the back of the pull-forward of the typical respiratory seasonality into the third quarter from the fourth quarter. Management’s confidence in QuidelOrtho’s strategic plan and ability to achieve its full-year financial guidance also look promising for the company.In September, QuidelOrtho announced that it had been granted a CLIA Waiver by the FDA, which applies to its new Sofia 2 SARS Antigen+ FIA (fluorescent immunoassay). The Sofia 2 SARS Antigen+ FIA is now the first rapid antigen test to receive a CLIA waiver. This looks promising for the stock.The company’s preliminary projection of robust improvement in revenues on the back of strength in its businesses lifts our confidence about the stock.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 12.3% between Jul 3 and Oct 1, 2023 compared with the industry’s 10.8% decline and the S&amp;P 500’s 3.2% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, QuidelOrtho carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Boston Scientific Corporation BSX, McKesson Corporation MCK and Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR.Boston Scientific, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 12.8%.

Volatility continues in October as the Fed warned of one more rate hike of 25 basis points by the end of this year and a higher interest rate regime for a longer period.

This indicates that the Fed’s policy of tight monetary control and a higher interest rate regime is finally paying off.Moreover, October is historically known as being favorable to U.S. stock markets.

Pipeline setbacks and competition for lead drug Jakafi weigh on shares.Shares of Incyte have lost 29.6% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s decline of 20.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares took a hit last month after the FDA approved GSK plc’s GSK momelotinib under the brand name Ojjaara for the treatment of intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, including primary myelofibrosis or secondary myelofibrosis (post-polycythemia vera and post-essential thrombocythaemia), in adults with anemia. Ojjaara is a once-a-day oral JAK1/JAK2 and activin A receptor type 1 inhibitor.Incyte’s lead drug, Jakafi (ruxolitinib), a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, is also approved for myelofibrosis. The approval of another JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor for the same indication will pose competition for Jakafi, particularly given Ojjaara’s comprehensive labeling. Ojjaara is approved for newly diagnosed and previously treated myelofibrosis patients with anemia that addresses the critical manifestations of the disease, namely anemia, constitutional symptoms and splenomegaly.Earlier, Incyte suffered a setback when the FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) for ruxolitinib extended-release (XR) tablets for once-daily use in the treatment of certain types of myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera (PV) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).The CRL stated that the FDA could not approve the new drug application (NDA) in its present form. The regulatory body acknowledged that the study submitted to the NDA met its objective of bioequivalence based on the area under the curve parameters but identified additional requirements for approval.Incyte also discontinued the phase III LIMBER-304 trial following the results of a pre-planned interim analysis conducted by an independent data monitoring committee, indicating that the study is unlikely to meet the primary endpoint in the intent-to-treat patient population. The recommendation to stop the study was not due to safety.Story continuesLIMBER-304 evaluated the efficacy and safety of parsaclisib plus Jakafi versus placebo plus Jakafi in adult (age ≥18 years) patients with myelofibrosis who have an inadequate response to Jakafi monotherapy.These setbacks were disappointing as the company is looking to strengthen its portfolio.Incyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Incyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseIncyte Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Incyte Corporation Quote Nevertheless, growth in Jakafi and continued momentum from Opzelura (ruxolitinib) cream in atopic dermatitis (AD) and vitiligo in the United States propelled the company to post a 25% revenue growth in the second quarter.The uptake of Opzelura has been strong, driven by patient demand growth and payer coverage expansion as the launch in AD and vitiligo continues.Opzelura was also approved in Europe for treating nonsegmental vitiligo with facial involvement. Moreover, three phase II studies in lichen planus, lichen sclerosus and mild to moderate hidradenitis suppurativa have completed enrollment. Two phase III trials evaluating ruxolitinib cream in prurigo nodularis are ongoing.The FDA also approved Zynyz (retifanlimab-dlwr), a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1), for treating adults with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced merkel cell carcinoma.Approval of additional drugs will add incremental revenues to the top line and reduce the company’s dependence on Jakafi. Incyte has a collaboration agreement with Swiss pharma giant Novartis NVS for Jakafi.Jakafi is marketed by Incyte in the United States and by Novartis as Jakavi outside the country.Incyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

These data were presented today in a late-breaking oral presentation (Abstract #6746; Session: D3T01.3I: Late Breaking News) at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress 2023, held from October 11-14 in Berlin. Additionally, results from a Phase 1 open-label maximum-use trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of ruxolitinib cream in children (age ≥2 to &lt;12 years) treated under maximum-use conditions over an 8-week trial period were featured as an ePoster at the EADV Congress 2023.Data from the TRuE-AD3 study, which build upon previously announced topline results, showed the study met its primary endpoint with significantly more patients treated with ruxolitinib cream (0.75% and 1.5%) achieving Investigator’s Global Assessment Treatment Success (IGA-TS) than patients treated with vehicle control (non-medicated cream). IGA-TS is defined as an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with at least a two-point improvement from baseline at Week 8. In addition, secondary endpoints such as time to NRS4 (≥4-point improvement in itch Numerical Rating Scale [NRS] score) and patients demonstrating at least a 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) at Week 8 were also achieved.Story continues""The TRuE-AD3 data presented today at EADV reinforce the strong safety and efficacy profile of ruxolitinib cream and its potential to treat younger age groups,"" said Jim Lee, M.D., Group Vice President, Inflammation &amp; AutoImmunity, Incyte. ""There is still a significant medical need for a nonsteroidal topical treatment that provides rapid and effective control of the signs and symptoms of AD in children.""Additional key findings from the TRuE-AD3 study include:Fifty-six percent (56.5%) of patients treated with ruxolitinib cream 1.5% and 36.6% treated with ruxolitinib cream 0.75% achieved IGA-TS at Week 8 (P&lt;=0.0001 for both) compared to 10.8% of patients treated with vehicle.More than half (67.2%/51.5%) of patients treated with ruxolitinib cream (1.5% and 0.75% respectively) achieved EASI75 compared to those treated with vehicle at Week 8 (15.4%; P&lt;0.0001 for both).In patients 6 to &lt;12 years old, NRS4 was achieved by 43.4% (1.5% treatment arm) and 37.5% (0.75% treatment arm) of patients at Week 8 compared to those treated with vehicle (29.7%).Median time to NRS4 was 13.0/11.0 days (1.5% and 0.75% respectively) compared to 23.0 days for vehicle (hazard ratio, 1.74/1.77; P&lt;0.05 for both).The mean steady-state plasma concentrations (Css) of ruxolitinib at Week 8 were 23.2 nM (1.5% ruxolitinib cream) and 11.3 nM (0.75% ruxolitinib cream), which are well below 281 nM (the level above which bone-marrow suppression may be induced1), suggesting meaningful systemic JAK inhibition is highly unlikely.Ruxolitinib cream was well tolerated with no serious infections, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), malignancies or thromboses reported during the 8-week vehicle-controlled period. The most common treatment-related adverse event observed in the ruxolitinib cream arms was application site pain (2.7% vs 0% in vehicle arm).Results from the maximum-use trial (MUsT) in children (age ≥2 to &lt;12 years) with at least 35% of their body surface area affected by AD showed ruxolitinib cream was well tolerated, with efficacy results consistent with data from an adolescent and adult maximum-use study and a pilot pharmacokinetics (PK)/safety pediatric study2,3.Key findings from the MUsT study include:About 20% (20.7%) of patients treated with ruxolitinib cream 1.5% reported treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) through Week 8; none were serious or led to treatment interruption or discontinuation. No TEAEs suggestive of systemic JAK inhibition were reported.The mean (SD) Css of ruxolitinib cream through Week 4 was 98.2 (148) nM, which is well below 281 nM, suggesting meaningful systemic JAK inhibition is highly unlikely.Approximately 54% of patients achieved an IGA of 0 or 1 and approximately 73% achieved NRS4 by Week 4.Opzelura is indicated for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate AD in non-immunocompromised patients 12 years of age and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies, or when those therapies are not advisable.""AD is a chronic immune-mediated disease that impacts about 13 percent of children in the U.S., yet there remains a need for new treatment options to help this age group manage this difficult to treat skin condition,"" said Dr. Lawrence Eichenfield, Chief of Pediatric and Adolescent Dermatology at Rady Children’s Hospital San Diego. ""As a clinician, I have been extremely pleased with the results achieved by many of my adolescent and adult patients with AD prescribed ruxolitinib cream, and I am excited about the potential to have a safe, well tolerated and effective non-steroidal topical treatment option available to my pediatric patients in the future.""AD – the most common type of eczema – is a chronic skin disease, which in the U.S. affects an estimated 2-3 million patients ages 2-11 and more than 21 million people 12 years of age and older4,5. It is characterized by inflammation and itch. Signs and symptoms include irritated and itchy skin that can cause red lesions that may ooze and crust. People with AD are also more susceptible to bacterial, viral and fungal infections6.More information regarding the EADV Congress 2023 can be found at https://eadvcongress2023.org/.About TRuE-AD3TRuE-AD3 (NCT04921969) is a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib cream compared to vehicle (non-medicated cream) in children with atopic dermatitis (AD). The study enrolled over 300 patients (age ≥2 to &lt;12 years) diagnosed with AD for at least three months and who were candidates for topical therapy.Patients with an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 2 to 3 (a measure of disease severity), and with AD on 3% to 20% of their Body Surface Area (BSA; excluding scalp) were randomized 2:2:1 to receive ruxolitinib cream 0.75% administered twice daily (BID); ruxolitinib cream 1.5% BID; or vehicle (non-medicated cream) BID. Patients who successfully completed an efficacy assessment at Week 8 were offered participation in the 44-week long-term safety treatment extension period with their same treatment group (ruxolitinib cream 0.75% or 1.5% BID). Patients initially randomized to vehicle cream were re-randomized (1:1) in a blinded manner to one of the active treatment groups.The primary endpoint of TRuE-AD3 is the proportion of patients achieving an Investigator’s Global Assessment Treatment Success (IGA-TS), defined as an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with at least a two-point improvement from baseline at Week 8. Secondary endpoints include: the proportion of patients achieving at least a 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) – another measurement of disease extent and severity – the proportion of patients (age ≥6 to &lt;12 years) with at least a 4-point improvement in the itch numerical rating scale (NRS4 at Week 8 and time to achieve NRS4). The study is also tracking the frequency, duration and severity of adverse events associated with the use of ruxolitinib cream.For more information about the study, please visit https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04921969.About MUsT (NCT05034822)The MUsT pediatric maximum-use study (NCT05034822) is a Phase 1 open-label trial evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy and patient-reported outcomes (PRO) of ruxolitinib cream after topical application twice daily (BID) in children over a 52-week treatment period.Children ages ≥2 to &lt;12 years old with an atopic dermatitis (AD) diagnosis for &gt;three months, an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe), with AD on ≥35% of their body surface area (BSA; excluding scalp) and with an itch Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score of ≥4 (for patients 6 to &lt;12 years of age) were eligible. Patients enrolled applied ruxolitinib cream 1.5% twice daily (BID) to baseline lesions for four weeks (maximum use trial period), then only to active lesions for an additional four weeks (treatment extension period), for a total treatment period of eight weeks. Eligible patients were offered the option to continue into a 44-week long-term safety (LTS) period continuing this regimen as-needed to active lesions. All study patients will have a 30-day safety follow-up visit.The primary outcome measure of the pediatric maximum-use study is the number of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), defined as any adverse event reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after first application of ruxolitinib cream. Secondary outcome measures included concentration of ruxolitinib in plasma, steady-state plasma concentration (Css) of ruxolitinib and accumulation ratio of ruxolitinib between plasma concentrations at one hour post application.For more information about the study, please visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05034822.About Opzelura® (ruxolitinib) Cream 1.5%Opzelura, a novel cream formulation of Incyte’s selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, approved by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in patients 12 years of age and older, is the first and only treatment for repigmentation approved for use in the United States. Opzelura is also approved in the U.S. for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) in non-immunocompromised patients 12 years of age and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies, or when those therapies are not advisable. Use of Opzelura in combination with therapeutic biologics, other JAK inhibitors, or potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine or cyclosporine, is not recommended.In Europe, Opzelura (ruxolitinib) cream 15mg/g is approved for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age.Incyte has worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib cream, marketed in the United States as Opzelura.Opzelura is a registered trademark of Incyte.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONSERIOUS INFECTIONSPatients treated with oral Janus kinase inhibitors for inflammatory conditions are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Reported infections include:Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease.Invasive fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and pneumocystosis.Bacterial, viral, including herpes zoster, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.Avoid use of OPZELURA in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. If a serious infection develops, interrupt OPZELURA until the infection is controlled. Carefully consider the benefits and risks of treatment prior to initiating OPZELURA in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with OPZELURA.Serious lower respiratory tract infections were reported in the clinical development program with topical ruxolitinib.No cases of active tuberculosis (TB) were reported in clinical trials with OPZELURA. Cases of active TB were reported in clinical trials of oral Janus kinase inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Consider evaluating patients for latent and active TB infection prior to administration of OPZELURA. During OPZELURA use, monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of TB.Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical trials with Janus kinase inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions including OPZELURA. If a patient develops herpes zoster, consider interrupting OPZELURA treatment until the episode resolves.Hepatitis B viral load (HBV-DNA titer) increases, with or without associated elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, have been reported in patients with chronic HBV infections taking oral ruxolitinib. OPZELURA initiation is not recommended in patients with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C.MORTALITYIn a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor comparing an oral JAK inhibitor to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker treatment, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed with the JAK inhibitor. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OPZELURA.MALIGNANCIESMalignancies were reported in patients treated with OPZELURA. Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. In RA patients treated with an oral JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk.Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OPZELURA, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancers), patients who develop a malignancy when on treatment, and patients who are current or past smokers.Non-melanoma skin cancers, including basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma, have occurred in patients treated with OPZELURA. Perform periodic skin examinations during OPZELURA treatment and following treatment as appropriate. Exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using broad-spectrum sunscreen.MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS (MACE)In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with an oral JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke), was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. Discontinue OPZELURA in patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke.Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OPZELURA, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. Discontinue OPZELURA in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke.THROMBOSISThromboembolic events were observed in trials with OPZELURA. Thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and arterial thrombosis have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Many of these adverse reactions were serious and some resulted in death. In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with an oral JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of thrombosis was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Avoid OPZELURA in patients at risk. If symptoms of thrombosis occur, discontinue OPZELURA and treat appropriately.Thrombocytopenia, Anemia, and NeutropeniaThrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia were reported in the clinical trials with OPZELURA. Consider the benefits and risks for individual patients who have a known history of these events prior to initiating therapy with OPZELURA. Perform CBC monitoring as clinically indicated. If signs and/or symptoms of clinically significant thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia occur, patients should discontinue OPZELURA.Lipid ElevationsTreatment with oral ruxolitinib has been associated with increases in lipid parameters including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides.Adverse ReactionsIn nonsegmental vitiligo, the most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥1%) are application site acne (6%), application site pruritus (5%), nasopharyngitis (4%), headache (4%), urinary tract infection (2%), application site erythema (2%), and pyrexia (1%).PregnancyThere is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in pregnant persons exposed to OPZELURA during pregnancy. Pregnant persons exposed to OPZELURA and healthcare providers should report OPZELURA exposure by calling 1-855-463-3463.LactationAdvise women not to breastfeed during treatment with OPZELURA and for approximately four weeks after the last dose (approximately 5-6 elimination half-lives).Please see Full Prescribing Information, including Boxed Warning, and Medication Guide for OPZELURA.About Incyte DermatologyIncyte’s science-first approach and expertise in immunology has formed the foundation of the company.

247,5fea7f25-1323-36db-97a6-e14468802cdd,INTU,2023-10-14,Intuit Inc: An Exploration into Its Intrinsic Value,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuit-inc-exploration-intrinsic-value-120030389.html,1697198430,STORY,['INTU'],"[In this article, we will take a look into Intuit Inc's (NASDAQ:INTU) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with INTU.As of 2023-10-13, Intuit Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $203.02. It's currently trading at a price of $543.41. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -167.66%. The company is significantly overvalued.Intuit Inc: An Exploration into Its Intrinsic ValueThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Intuit Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$8.44GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.62%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 16.10% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=108.96Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=94.06Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=203.02Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $415.07. This valuation indicates that the Intuit Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -30.92%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

It is worth considering LyondellBasell (LYB), which belongs to the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry.This oil refiner and chemical company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 22.72%.For the most recent quarter, LyondellBasell was expected to post earnings of $2.29 per share, but it reported $2.44 per share instead, representing a surprise of 6.55%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.80 per share, while it actually produced $2.50 per share, a surprise of 38.89%.For LyondellBasell, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.LyondellBasell currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.63%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Progressive cites pricing improvements and profitability gains that boosted its latest results.Gold futures (GC=F) trend upward, coming off their best week since March. Prices rose as geopolitical tensions like the Israel-Hamas conflict increased demand for safe haven assets.

For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Looking at some of the other individual movers that we are watching on the day that we haven't yet talked about, Progressive, those shares at a record high on the day, up 8%. And that's after the company reported strong September and third quarter results here. And it looked like underwriting profitability was improving, and the company's pricing also improving. So that helping the numbers.- Yeah, last time they reported, remember, over the summer, not such a great reaction, not such a great response. But this today, that was a sharp move higher, up over 8% in today's trade. I know Jefferies, for example, liked what they see. Strong year-over-year and month-over-month improvement in underlying results is what they were telling their clients. So nice move today. And that stock up about 20% now so far this year.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and one of the other measures you look at with insurers is called the combined ratio. You look at it for health insurers too. It basically looks at losses and expenses against the premiums that they have brought in. And it was 89.7%. So a lower number is good because you want to not be spending everything on all of the premiums that are coming in. You want to keep on to some of them. So that is down quite a bit from the 97% in August. So a big improvement, in other words, in that measure of Progressive's results.Story continues- All right, from insurer to the yellow metal. Let's talk gold, having its best week since March, by the way. Prices rising this week amid the Israel-Hamas war. Investors pushing into the space as a safe haven amid this conflict. So makes sense, Julie, right? When there is war, there's tension, there's conflict, there is a lot of uncertainty.We were just discussing about whether that conflict broadens with a ground offensive by Israel. Does it drag in Hezbollah? Does it drag in Iran? Just lots of uncertainty. In addition, what that, of course, would mean for oil, the energy markets. When people feel that kind of nervousness, they feel that kind of uncertainty, they look to safe havens. And of course, gold would be one of your go-to moves there.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and it's a switch for gold, which had been going back towards 1,800, as we just showed on that chart. And now going up back to the 1,900 level, which is a level that we haven't seen in a little while here. There's that chart that we've seen for the year. So interesting that it dipped down to 18 and then made a pretty rapid move, especially when you consider that gold does not always make that kind of a rapid move. So interesting to see that there.We're also seeing a surge in options trading on the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, GLD, right? Implied volatility for options also up the most since March. So another measure, effectively, of interest there. By the way, the move that is happening in gold is not just happening in gold, of course. You're seeing it in other asset classes too, where investors are looking for safety.You could argue that utilities, which is viewed as a defensive sector, the part of the move there is spurred by that. And then also, the move down in yields that we have seen a little bit this week is because people are buying treasuries, which, again, are seen as, on a relative basis, a safer investment.- And reports noting with that move in gold, by the way, you are breaking through some key technical levels as well. So one to keep an eye on.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, definitely. One more stock that we are watching, AMC. After getting a little bit of a pop yesterday, plummeting today by about 14%. Trying to figure out exactly what's going on here. Could be the Taylor Swift Eras Tour movie, which brought in $2.8 million at the box office for Thursday previews.It sounds like a big number. It was below the estimate of $5 million. But it seems like it mostly has to do with timing. Swift moved up unexpectedly the timeline of the movie's release, which could have limited marketing and ticket sales because people didn't have a lot of time to then get tickets and react when she moved up the release time, so.- I'm also impressed just by the bold icon move like a Taylor Swift who-- I'm reading through these reports, Julie-- she negotiated directly with AMC. So she bypassed the Hollywood studios in the distribution deal, which means she skips the distribution fees, which means maybe even more lucrative for her.JULIE HYMAN: You know what always cracks me up?- Yeah?JULIE HYMAN: Do you think Taylor Swift herself was sitting down and doing these negotiations?- I don't know.JULIE HYMAN: Like, we always use Taylor Swift as shorthand. But, like, how many people does she have working for her? She's got--- I would assume it's a machine.JULIE HYMAN: She made-- she made a good choice in whoever she's hired to do this kind of work.- You're saying she's not at the table right now just making these deals with Adam Aron? You don't think so?JULIE HYMAN: Maybe.- Who am I to say? I don't know.JULIE HYMAN: I don't know. But I don't think the assumption is that she is, right?

The third quarter results we reported today reflect well balanced and durable growth, supported by disciplined execution and the steadfast commitment to ensure high-quality comprehensive care is well within reach for every person we're privileged to serve. Evolution in our marketplace, including regulatory changes, means agility and adaptability must continue to be defining characteristics of our company. The people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare continuously strive to find new ways to innovate, serve and grow.As a direct result of their mission-driven focus, this year, we'll serve even more people more comprehensively than anticipated in the outlook we offered at the end of 2022. By the close of this year, we will serve nearly 900,000 additional patients under value-based care arrangements at Optum Health, almost 1 million new consumers across UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage offerings and a total more than 1.5 billion scripts to the people who rely on Optum Rx.Based on this performance, we're strengthening our 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.85 to $25 per share. The confidence we have in our sustained long-term growth outlook is exemplified by the 14% third quarter revenue increase we reported this morning, more than $11 billion above last year. The sources of this growth will drive many more years of strong performance.Value-based care is the centerpiece of our long-term strategy, precisely because it delivers on the promise of high-quality clinical outcomes and experiences at lower cost than traditional models. This year, we expect Optum Health will serve more than 4 million people in fully accountable relationships, almost twice as many people as we served just 2 years ago. Many of these patients have serious health challenges, few economic resources and until now, often had limited access to care or the type of care they truly need.Ramping up to engage these patients require significant upfront investment and high-touch reach. These early efforts ensure we can address patients' unique needs and design personalized care plans that drive better health outcomes, increase quality of life and deliver cost savings throughout the health system. Making the investments to serve people who have endured far too many barriers to care is an easy choice for us all.In 2023, you have seen both our commitment and financial capacity to invest to further enable our ability to serve and to grow far into the future. In recent years, we've invested significant resources in building our capabilities to care for people most effectively for the life or health stage they find themselves in, whether they need preventative or palliative care or are best served in a click at home or virtually.In particular, we're advancing our ability to care for people in their homes and integrating that physical care with our pharmacy and behavioral offerings. This work means developing an even more versatile clinical workforce to serve consumers in more ways through clinic-based Optum Care delivery capabilities and extending our reach to consumers who may not have ready access to physical clinics.Medicare Advantage continues to be a powerful force in driving superior health outcomes for consumers and in helping to lower costs at the system level. Today, about half of all seniors in the U.S. have chosen Medicare Advantage over traditional Medicare, and that number will continue to expand for very good reasons. The results are well documented. Medicare Advantage outperforms traditional fee-for-service for seniors on many measures, including lower rates of hospitalization. And they spend up to 45% less out of pocket compared to those in Medicare fee-for-service. Importantly, this high value for consumers is delivered at a lower cost to the health system. UnitedHealthcare serves more people in high-quality 4 star and higher Medicare Advantage plans than any other organization. Looking to the 2024 enrollment period, which begins Sunday, we're confident our offerings will again resonate with consumers as they prioritize high-quality care and stable benefits.In the reduced funding environment health plans face, I credit our teams for investing in the areas consumers value most, including $0 premium plans, no co-pays for primary, virtual and preventative care and no co-pay for hundreds of the most commonly prescribed drugs.I want to highlight one more aspect of our growth story, the consistently strong performance of our pharmacy businesses. Pharmacy, as you know, is the most common consumer touch point in health care. What consumers and employers want more than anything is access to the most effective treatments in the moment they need them for the lowest possible cost.Optum Rx is delivering on those expectations. This most recent selling season is on track to be among our strongest, reflecting a combination of new clients and retention rates in the very high 90s. And as the coming season for 2025 develops, we're expecting another year of robust growth. Our clients tell us they value the enhancements we are making to our pharmacy offerings, providing them transparency and choice while also integrating new tools and capabilities. Notably, our pharmacy service offerings go far beyond the foundational benefit management capabilities and now account for about half of all Optum Rx revenues. We continue to expand the reach of our community pharmacies and our diverse specialty and infusion offerings are growing double digits.Driving this expanding market demand is the enormous pressure facing employers, health plans, governments and others to manage and respond to manufacturer list pricing. The services offered by Optum Rx and others are the only counterbalance to drug company pricing. The foundational business objectives for PBMs is to lower costs and make medicines more affordable and accessible for individuals and families. PBMs are the only entities in the drug supply chain with that exclusive focus and incentive, and we're honored to play this critical role.These pillars of our growth, value-based care, pharmacy and our innovative benefits businesses, alongside our health technology and financial service capabilities underpin our ability to develop ever stronger value propositions for the people who receive and those who pay for care and support our confidence in a future of growth.And with that, I'll pass it to Dirk McMahon, our President and COO.Dirk C. McMahonThanks, Andrew. I recently hosted UnitedHealthcare's National Accounts Forum, where we bring together client leaders twice a year to share ideas and gather feedback. These are some of the biggest and most sophisticated companies in America that collectively employ and sponsor coverage for millions of people. And to no surprise, health care costs top their list of concerns, especially the rising cost of drugs. In addition, they want innovation, new tools to help their employees take full advantage of their benefits, achieve better health outcomes and save money. And of course, it has to be digital.Let me offer a few examples of innovation that have fueled our growth outlook, starting with our mobile platform, the primary access point for millions of UHC members. Each year, we add new capabilities to provide consumers with increased on-demand care access, highly personalized information about their benefits, real-time support, cost estimation tools, integrated pharmacy capabilities and enhanced rewards.Another example, our newest and fastest-growing commercial offerings, which featured no annual deductibles and incentivize people to make good health care choices by offering an unprecedented view into quality and cost. When seeking care options, consumers see potential care providers' latest reviews and quality designations. And they see what they will actually pay for their care, which will help them make the most important decisions. UnitedHealthcare members and these offerings are receiving more preventative care while paying about 50% less out of pocket compared to people enrolled in traditional offerings, and their employers can reduce the total cost of care with an average savings of 11%. These results are why such new offerings are among our fastest growing.Beyond these consumer-facing innovations, we're leveraging the latest technologies to create greater operational capacity and productivity so we can better serve consumers and focus on the highest value work. Our teams are significantly improving how quickly we respond to the millions of benefit questions we receive each year. We are using AI and natural language processing to expedite call documentation to rapidly generate accurate summaries of consumer interactions with our contact centers, saving millions of dollars in administrative work and freeing up capacity for our people to prioritize engagement.We're also utilizing these technologies to translate and interpret unstructured data such as physician notes, which will help, for example, provide deeper insights for life sciences customers so they can better assess the efficacy of their treatments. Of course, these are just a few of the hundreds of AI applications powered by OptumInsight we are actively developing, testing and deploying today to further elevate the consumer and care provider experience while driving increased quality and lower costs.And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John Rex.John F. RexThank you, Dirk. The Growth we reported today is a direct result of investments made over many years to develop and connect the diverse health capabilities needed to serve the people who rely on us each day, while also creating the foundational capacity to serve millions more in the years ahead. This capability development has long been in the making and is still very much underway as the opportunities to serve more people more deeply continue to expand.Before reviewing our business results, I'll offer a few brief comments on care activity. Care patterns remain consistent with the view we shared during the second quarter, with activity levels still led by outpatient care for seniors and still most notably in the orthopedic and cardiac procedure categories. These trends remain stable at the levels we previously described. As we've noted, our outlook assumes these activity levels persist throughout next year.We continuously monitor a broad spectrum of patient acuity levels and have yet to see any other notable changes. For example, within oncology, the average stage at which we are first seeing cancer diagnoses remains consistent with historical patterns. As always, we remain diligent in looking for changes to the underlying health of patients.With that, let's turn to our third quarter results. Revenues of $92.4 billion grew by 14% over the prior year, with double-digit growth again at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Optum Health revenues grew by 29%, approaching $24 billion, driven by an increase in the number of care services we offer and patients we serve, especially for those with complex care needs.Operating margins continue to reflect the initial clinical engagement activities that support the strong growth in patients we have realized this year as well as the higher care activity patterns we have discussed. Optum Rx revenues grew by 14%, approaching $29 billion, driven by the strength in our pharmacy care services offerings as well as new customer wins. Script growth of nearly 7% reflects customer response to our innovative solutions, which focus on choice and lowest net cost.OptumInsight revenues grew by 35% to $5 billion. Revenue backlog of over $31 billion increased by more than $7 billion in part due to the change health care combination. In addition, we recently announced a partnership to provide revenue cycle, analytics and information technology services to a health system serving more than 400,000 people in the Midwest.Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Our commercial business added nearly 700,000 people through the third quarter. Further, selling season indications are tracking favorably, particularly in national accounts. So as '24 begins, we expect to grow to serve an additional 1 million people with commercial benefits.Within our public sector programs, we expect growth of nearly 1 million Medicare Advantage members this year. And looking to the year ahead, we're encouraged by the consumer value, stability and breadth of our offerings. And as always, we start with an expectation that we will outpace overall market growth.Our Medicaid performance remains strong as we support people and families through the redeterminations process. Our teams are really leaning in, speaking with thousands of consumers each day. Through a comprehensive outreach program, we are helping people navigate the process and connecting them with the resources they need to retain or reinstate their health benefits or to help them find other affordable coverages. A significant majority of the people we engage with are able to retain or reinstate their coverage.Our capital capacities remain strong. For the first 9 months of the year, adjusted cash flows from operations were at $22.4 billion or 1.3x net income. And in that same time frame, we returned over $11.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.As noted, given the strength of our business performance, this morning, we have updated our '23 outlook for adjusted earnings to $24.85 to $25 per share. And as we finish strongly in '23 and look forward to '24, we're intensely focused on execution while further expanding our capacity to serve more people more deeply and building the foundations to support our growth objectives for years to come.Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.Andrew Philip WittyThanks, John. Before opening up for questions, I'll offer some preliminary observations about next year while reserving most of this conversation for our investor conference on November 29. Our businesses continue to build momentum, while maintaining flexibility and adaptability for an ever-changing landscape even as we invest for the future. We're focused on our strategic growth pillars and driving efficiencies throughout the enterprise at an accelerated pace.At this distance, analyst earnings estimates for 2024 reasonably reflect the performance view we expect to offer in November with consensus near the upper end of our likely initial outlook range. Importantly, the growth we're realizing today and our expanding capacity served to further reinforce the confidence we have in our long-term 13% to 16% growth objective.And with that, I'll now ask the operator to open up for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.Lisa Christine GillI wanted to start with GLP-1s and really understand from 2 sides. One, when we think about rates for 2024, can you talk about what you've incorporated in rates around GLP-1s, especially around weight loss as we have new products coming to the market? And how do I think about that from the PBM side when we think about the services that you can wrap around that and sell from a PBM perspective?Andrew Philip WittyLisa, thanks so much for the question. In a second, I'll ask Brian Thompson from UHC and Dr. Patrick Conway to respond to your comments in a little more detail. But let me just preface all of that. The thing we're most overall focused on GLP-1 space is, honestly, the pricing. We're very positive about the potential for another tool in the toolbox to help folks manage their weight. We recognize that has potential benefits. But we're struggling. And frankly, our clients are struggling with the list prices, which have been demanded of these products in the U.S., which are running at about 10x the level of price which have been paid in Western Europe. So overall, I'd say that is our focus is to try and find a way to make this a sustainable and affordable space for our clients to support.With that said, let me ask Brian to give you a perspective from UHC and how they've incorporated this in their forward view.Brian Robert ThompsonSure. Thanks for the question there, Lisa. First, to put in context, GLP-1s, over 80% on the diabetic side. So as we think about weight loss, up to maybe 20% of our total spend. And it's largely performing in line with what we had planned as we went into '23, and we feel very confident and comfortable about how we're looking at that going forward into '24. As you think about it, keep in mind, the vast majority of the coverage here is in our fee-based business. That's our self-employed customers, and that's still at less than 1/3, around 30% of our book.As we look forward, our customers considering to cover more or less. I would say it's a mixed bag. Some are seeking coverage, albeit dissatisfied with the price points. Some are backing off given the cost. But I wouldn't really be directional one way or the other on whether or not we're seeing more or less coverage on the weight less side as we look forward. But again, to Andrew's point, beyond just getting to the obvious lower price points, we're really trying to work with manufacturers to get to some aligned value-based constructs, getting pricing to a point where it's based on outcomes and adherence levels all the way to outright risk on utilization levels and pairing those with therapies and programs that can put less reliance on lifelong adherence requirements like these drugs currently have. We're not there yet. We're optimistic that we can get there. But clearly, price point is a key barrier.Andrew Philip WittyBrian, thanks so much. And Patrick, maybe from the -- from Optum Rx perspective, you could talk a little bit about the broader approaches we take.Patrick Hugh ConwayThank you. As Andrew said, our customers, payers, employers, people we serve are concerned about the prices of GLP-1s as set by manufacturers. OptumRx will continue to negotiate lower prices through discounts over time, be transparent with our customers and implement clinical evidence-based guidelines so the right people get appropriate medicines.And as you alluded to, Lisa, obesity and cardiometabolic disease is a major public issue -- health issue in the U.S. And across all of Optum, we are developing and implementing comprehensive solutions, of which medicines are only a part of on behalf of our clients and people we serve to drive better health outcomes for all and value to the health system.Andrew Philip WittyThanks, Patrick. And Lisa, thanks so much for the question.OperatorWe'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.Albert J. RiceSimilar to last quarter, the trend in margin in Optum Health and OptumInsight has been down year-to-year. I know you've called out change, particularly with OptumInsight. But I wondered if there's any ability to discuss unusual items, nonrecurring items. I know you said you had some cost reduction programs you were implementing this quarter in Optum Health. Did those impact the results? And is there any change as you look ahead to '24 and your margin expectations or targets for those 2 businesses?Andrew Philip WittyA.J., thanks so much for the question. I appreciate it. So let me just make a few comments, particularly as it speaks to the Optum Health part of the question that you raised. So as you look at 2023, essentially, what we've seen and we referred to this in Q2, greater growth in the number of people, patients that we've been privileged to serve this year, particularly the more complex patients. So very strong. And you heard in our opening commentary, very strong growth in the number of fully accountable lives running at about 900,000. Substantial fraction of that coming into more complex cases.As I said back in the last call, we're very, very pleased to have that growth that we believe that is really foundational or a key foundation for future long-term growth of the business. However, within that, the mix of that population is a little different than what we expected. That takes time to then build the engagement capabilities that we need to be able to work with those people and their care providers to ensure the very best care is delivered the most efficient and effective way.And that's really the bulk of the investment that we're talking about. It's really taking the time, looking after those folks in the way they need to be looked after right now in advance of us being able to engage with them fully and deliver them the various interventions and advices that we can provide that we're really building throughout Optum to ensure that not just in 1 year, but over multiple years, those folks get increasingly better care delivery and better outcomes.And recall that these patients, in many cases, have really been somewhat not necessarily looked after as well as they could have been by the system because of their very complexity. In some cases, they're not able to get to clinics, which is why we build -- been building up our home care capabilities and other wraparound services to the classic clinic approach. That's really the driving force.Now as that speaks to the future, 2 things really, A.J. One is we are super confident around our ability to continue to grow the number of patients who were able to look after. Number two, as those capabilities that have been accelerated during this year begin to affect the -- both the quality positively and the cost of how these patients care is delivered, you're going to see that shine through an improved economic performance of Optum Health. And as we look forward, we're very confident about continued strengthening of that business. Make no mistake, Optum Health is having a very strong growth year, and we're taking the opportunity this year to really ready ourselves and build strength for the next many years of that business. A.J., thanks so much for the question.OperatorWe'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.Joshua Richard RaskinUnderstanding that you expect Medicare Advantage to grow at a healthy pace, I think you said above market again in 2024. Could you speak to that progress expected at Optum Health? I know we'll get details at the Investor Day, but how are you thinking about the transition of patients from sort of fee-for-service to these fully risk engagements? And then maybe general levels of investment for growth in light of the risk model and reimbursement model changes.Andrew Philip WittySo Josh, thanks so much for the question. I mean, obviously, we'll leave very much the detail of the elements of the growth model for when we meet with you all in November. I mean, having said that, we would no reason not to expect a continued healthy momentum in our move toward value-based care next year with continued high expectations for our ability to deliver that.To your broader question, maybe just reflect a little bit again on 2023. So this has been a year which essentially has been obviously very heavily influenced by the change in the funding environment that was announced earlier in the year for Medicare Advantage. And we're very appreciative of the 3-year phase-in of the changes, which CMS ultimately decided to make. But obviously, those changes are essentially the equivalent to a price cut phased in over 3 years for the Medicare Advantage program.We're appreciative of the fact that we've had essentially 7, 8, 9 months warning of that in terms of when that was announced before we go into the '24 year. And that's allowed us, and we've taken full advantage of it to really focus on how we ready ourselves not just for 2024, but for the next 36 months. So 2023 has all for us been about ensuring that we reengineer our cost base, that we refocused our benefit strategies to those things that matter most to patients, that we strengthen and invest in our ability to manage affordability of care going forward into the system and that we're taking full advantage of building the capabilities we have already begun to construct around our consumer engagement, our technology, digital-first capabilities and ultimately doubling down on our commitment to value-based care.That has really been the story behind the investments of 2023 in response to the changes that have been signaled by CMS, so that we go into '24, '25, '26, '27 feeling strong, feeling that we've taken advantage of these last several months to ensure that we've adjusted and adapted our strategy and business in readiness for the change in the funding environment, which gives us strong confidence for next year and underpins our commitment to the signal I just gave you in terms of our potential for 2024.OperatorNext to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.Justin LakeI wanted to ask about UHC performance. First, your MLR was better than our expectations, but curious how it compared to your internal estimates. And maybe you could share how that might have come across -- come in across the 3 main business segments?And then quickly, on the third quarter UAC margins, I found it interesting that while the MLR deteriorated by 50 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. Overall, UHC margins actually improved by 50 basis points. So curious what might have drove that.Andrew Philip WittyJustin, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask John Rex to respond to the first part, and then Brian Thompson the second.John F. RexJustin. So overall, I'd call it broadly consistent with our expectations in terms of the third quarter. So a few things I'd like to highlight though. So care patterns were, as we discussed, focused again on outpatient activity with seniors. Those continue at the levels we described during the second quarter. And that's what really drove a lot of kind of the activity throughout the quarter. It's still in those categories that we have been focused on.The sequential move that you see from second quarter to third quarter is largely a seasonal factor. As you know well, there's always less care activity in a third quarter. That has to do just with vacations, a lot of the elements that go in there in terms of certain types of discretionary care, seasonal illnesses. So typical patterns and also Part D patterns that you see on a regular basis. In fact, if you go back to the years prior to 2020, 2Q would typically be the lowest care ratio quarter. So I'd say it's probably more typical than not, just getting back to periods that were more normalized in terms of the activities that we saw going on there. We continue to expect our full year medical care ratio will be -- toward the upper end of our initial 82.6%, plus/minus 50 basis point range. So very consistent with the level that we set out there back again toward the upper end of that outlook.So -- and then the seasonal factors in the 3Q, some of those things influencing where you'd expect to be in the fourth quarter, the final quarter of the calendar year. Certainly, utilization Part D impacts. They move the other direction in the fourth quarter. So typical in that. That's amplified, of course, very much by the deductible wearout features that you see in the fourth quarter, influenza, RSV, all those patterns that come in. So we'd expect that to move the other direction here as we go into the 4Q.Andrew Philip WittyGreat. Thanks, John. And Brian?Brian Robert ThompsonYes. John, I think you did a good job of explaining sort of the sequencing of the medical cost ratio. What I don't want to lose sight of is I think the key point is all of our businesses in UnitedHealthcare right now are really demonstrating innovation and market success at the same time. And you're seeing that come through in these margins, whether that's our complex care and health equity strategy in Medicaid, how we're showing up with broader service offerings and conveniences like UCard and URide in MA to complement strong, stable core benefits or some of the innovations you heard around the commercial benefits in Dirk's opening remarks. This is really translating into the type of growth and performance that I think you've come to expect from UnitedHealthcare, and I think it sets up a really nice baseline that I remain optimistic about as we look forward to 2024.Andrew Philip WittyThank so much, Brian and John.OperatorThe next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.Stephen C. BaxterI wanted to ask about the PBM business, obviously, interest in alternative or maybe even experimental models has been a big area of the base in the past quarter or so. I guess what are you hearing from your health plan and employer clients on their degree of interest in doing something totally transformational in terms of how they manage those benefits?Andrew Philip WittyStephen, thanks so much. Let me ask Patrick Conway to respond to that.Patrick Hugh ConwayYes. So as we interact with our clients, employers, payers and others on this, first, I'll note a recent survey came out approximately 90% of those clients are satisfied with their PBM. They're also satisfied with the level of transparency. Specifically for Optum Rx, we will continue to innovate and provide additional solutions to our clients that are comprehensive, integrated and transparent.I'll call out one other area, transparency to the consumer. This has been a journey for us that we continue to drive transparency to the consumer to call out. One example was Price Edge, a product recently launched, that's providing consumers the most affordable medicine at the point of care. We are seeing millions of consumers access use this tool as we provide it to them. And so you'll continue to see us to drive consumer transparency and innovative solutions to our clients.Andrew Philip WittyGreat. Patrick, thanks so much.OperatorWe'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.Nathan Allen RichI wanted to go back to the GLP-1 class. And I guess, as we're starting to see more outcomes data for these drugs, do you see that changing employers' willingness to cover this class given the potential long-term benefits? And how are you helping them think about potential ways to design the benefit to be able to manage that cost, which you guys talked about earlier being so much in focus for employers?Andrew Philip WittyYes, Nathan, thanks so much for the question. I mean there's an old adage which I quite like in this context, which is the innovation that is not affordable is not innovative. And that's really the key to all of this. So I have no argument. I don't think anybody at UnitedHealth Group has any argument with the prospects and possibility for the future of this drug class. And we recognize the need, and nothing would make us happier, honestly, to be able to lean forward and see more and more folks take advantage of these sorts of opportunities.But ultimately, it has to be affordable. And what we're hearing from our clients is they just -- they are really struggling to see how they embark on that journey of what they regard as a kind of open-ended financial risk. Now that's exactly why Brian earlier made the comment we did about we're trying to put forward 2 various manufacturers, a variety of different options, but we need the manufacturers to move. It's as simple as that. And we remain extremely open-minded to any model that works. We're working with our clients to ensure that they understand the various options. But they are giving us very, very, very clear signals. They need our help to make this a more affordable proposition for their employees and their members, and we'll continue to lean into that. Thanks for the question, Nathan.OperatorThe next to Scott Fidel with Stephens.Scott J. FidelCurious if you can give us your updated thoughts on -- from this vantage point, what you're thinking about the trajectory of just overall wage inflation in health care and how you're sort of planning for that. We had been seeing sort of moderation from the COVID peaks, but there certainly seems to be some pro inflationary risks out there when thinking about some of the federal policy proposals, state proposals and then obviously some of these union actions, too. So just curious on how you're thinking about wage inflation and health care moving forward and risks to that inflecting back upwards.Andrew Philip WittyYes, absolutely. Thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Dirk to give you a few comments on that.Dirk C. McMahonYes. Well, to start, what I would say as we go out and we negotiate with various health systems for prices as we move forward, one of the key things involved in those discussions is what wage inflation is and how it's impacting your cost. As we sit here today, it's lucky that we sort of have 3-year contracts, so it's muted a little bit. But what I would also say is we see a little bit of upward pressure on unit costs related to wages. But as I sit here today, it's not something that we haven't planned for and priced about.As I think about our own business, we haven't had trouble recruiting people such as nurses, clinicians. We've actually -- people really want to work for us. And from a capacity perspective, one of the things, as we've talked about our growth so far, we have to make sure we have the appropriate labor capacity to manage all the risks that we take. And as a consequence, we do spend a lot of time looking at the market. And as I said, people want to come to work for us. They like the mission. They like the ability to transform health care. And we're pretty pleased with our ability to hire and manage our operations going forward.Andrew Philip WittyThanks, Dirk. Thank you very much for the question.OperatorThe next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.Kevin Mark FischbeckGreat. I wanted to ask about Optum Health. I understand the commentary about membership coming in better, which creates a margin drag. But it feels like a couple of hundred thousand people, maybe low to mid-single digit more membership than you expected causing margins to drop from 8% to 7% or 12% essentially. It seems like a pretty big delta. So I assume there's other things going on in there beyond just digesting new membership growth. If not, then I guess we would know what the margin is on those new members.But is there anything else you would spike out there? And how do we think about building back from where we are today to that 8% to 12% -- 8% to 10% margin target? Is it simply about getting today's membership to target margins? Or is there a cost side? It seems like you're adjusting the labor force to some degree. Is there an MLR side? Is there a rate side? Any other color to kind of help us give us ability into the 8% to 10% over time?Andrew Philip WittyKevin, thanks so much for the question. So listen, by far and away, the most important phenomenon here are the things we've talked about to you already. So just to reiterate a little bit what we said to you back in Q2. So we've seen obviously the elevation in MLR, which has stabilized, hasn't really come down, isn't accelerating up, but definitely is a phenomena year-over-year, number one. Number two, increased behavioral care costs. Remember that within Optum Health, our behavioral business is -- that's where our behavioral business sits, and that has also seen significant increase year-over-year. We're very positive about that because it's a signal that people are engaging in seeking help for their behavioral conditions. And we know that, that entwines very importantly with their ongoing medical costs. But nonetheless, it's an element of elevation.And then as you rightly reiterate, a piece of it is the growth in our value-based lives and the mix of those lives. And by mix, that means complexity mix as well as geographic mix. And it takes -- as I said already today, it takes a little bit of time to build up the capabilities to allow us to engage properly with those folks at the level. We want to -- and we've really -- we have not held back on doing that, Kevin. And that's really the bulk of the investment during this cycle where we've really led into building those capabilities in readiness for the next, we hope, many years of serving these individuals higher and higher capability. Of course, and I made a comment earlier about reengineering our cost base. Of course, there are changes going on in our cost base across the whole organization, including Optum Health in response to the change in pricing signals from CMS. But I would put those very much kind of secondary to the core elements I've just described. We we're in a position, obviously, where we know exactly what these populations are that we're now looking after. That's been very much the basis of our forward views in terms of how we're starting to lay out for '24, '25, '26, and we feel very confident about our ability, not only to grow as an organization but to continue to strengthen margins back into the zone that you've historically been using used to. Thanks so much, Kevin, for that.OperatorThe next to Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.Sarah Elizabeth JamesI wanted to circle back to your comments on the strength in commercial growth in national accounts for next year. Can you give us a little bit of color on the pricing environment, given all the comments you've made on the moving pieces in cost trends? And then help us put into context that -- and the broader economy with how your clients are thinking about product selection, either in breadth or the type of products that they're purchasing from you in '24.Andrew Philip WittySarah, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Dan Kueter, who looks after our Commercial Insurance business to answer that.Dan KueterYes. Thanks, Andrew. Sarah, thanks for the question. The growth that John mentioned in his comments is settled business in our national accounts fee-based segments. So we're very happy with how that's completed. We're pricing and negotiating our fully insured business for January right now, and we're comfortable with how that's materializing as well. Employers continue to focus on both affordability and innovation, and our innovative products continue to resonate significantly in the market, as Dirk highlighted in his comments.Andrew Philip WittyThanks so much, Dan.OperatorThe next to David Windley with Jefferies.David Howard WindleyI wanted to pivot to OptumInsight. You had commented in previous calls about a fairly heavy level of spending to integrate change and invest in that platform. I wondered if you could update us on any ongoing spend in that regard. What we should expect in terms of implementation on ProHealth and kind of trajectory of margin in OptumInsight?Andrew Philip WittyDavid, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Roger Connor, who's our new CEO of OptumInsight to respond. Roger?Roger G. ConnorThank you. And David, thank you for the question. First of all, just to say, I'm delighted to be taking over the leadership of Insight. This is a pretty unique and special business. And getting to know the people, the products and the offerings, I think we're going to make a real difference to health care. So excited by that future.Just specifically, David, on your question, the change integration has gone really well, to be honest. You'll see in the Q3 margin that we had the tail end of some of that spend to integrate, but the Q3 margin is in line with our expectations. I think it is worth understanding the longer-term outlook for OptumInsight margin. We still believe that in the region of 18% to 22%. That's really driven by the mix of the businesses.As you know, we're a business that has software. We have services. So there are different margins in there. But when you take what we've created with change and you look at the overall portfolio that we have, we have this incredible portfolio that is addressing everything from clinical decision support. We've got products for admin efficiency. We've got other products for payment optimization. You add that growth engine, plus our innovation plus our margin profile, we're very confident about the future performance of Insight.Andrew Philip WittyThat's great. And I wonder whether Dan Schumacher, who's been very heavily involved in our various health systems partnerships, might just want to reflect a little bit on -- the question obviously was around ProHealth. But rather than talking specifically, maybe just share a few thoughts about the overall evolution of those health system profiles and how they play out over the first couple of years.Daniel J. SchumacherSure. Thanks, Andrew. David, I appreciate the question. Certainly, our health system partnerships, you mentioned one that we've announced recently. It's a growing portfolio for us. Obviously, at the health system level, there's a lot of pressures. We've talked in earlier questions about wage inflation and so forth. And we have a unique opportunity to really be able to address some of those near-term challenges while at the same time, provide some capacity for future evolution of the system as they think about more digital capacities, greater outpatient catchment as well as further engagement. So those are some of the things that we can help unlock for them and their migration to value-based care. So we're encouraged by the portfolio, it continues to grow. Actually from the initial scope, 9 out of 10 have expanded from their initial scope. So continuing to grow. We're in the early days, and we see a lot of opportunity ahead of us.Andrew Philip WittyDan, appreciate it. And thanks so much for the question.Daniel J. SchumacherThank you.OperatorWe'll go next to Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.Ann Kathleen HynesI would like to ask the GLP question more on the medical side. it sounds like right now, price appears to be the greatest barrier for widespread adoption assuming the outcome data continues to be positive. If pricing gets to a point that you view and your clients view as affordable, what do you think would be the long-term impact on care on the medical side? Are you seeing any near-term effects right now on MLR -- I should say, an MLR benefit And do you think it would be reasonable to assume, overall, MLRs should decline with greater adoption of these drugs? And maybe what categories or health spend do you think -- or do you view would be the biggest opportunity going forward?Andrew Philip WittyThanks so much for the question. I mean, I think, honestly, it's just way too early for us to be able to see anything like that just in terms of -- obviously, the weight loss indications are only just really coming into play. We haven't really been able to see, I'd say, anything from that perspective yet. And as I said earlier, the real focus for us right now is to try and figure out a way in which we can get to a position where the affordability of this class puts it in a zone where the people who need it can get it and can afford it. Nothing more to say on that, honestly.OperatorThe next to John Ransom with Raymond James.John Wilson RansomOn your fully accountable lives, what's the expectation where you'll end up the year with a number of Medicare fully advantage lives? And just looking at the eliminations, is it fair to assume that a lot of those fully accountable lives are coming out of the UAC book?Andrew Philip WittySo thanks very much for the question. I'll ask Dr. Amar Desai, who leads our Optum Health Organization just to comment a little bit on the kind of shape of the folks we look after there a degree to which they come from both UHC and obviously, many of our external partners. Amar?Amar A. DesaiJohn, thanks very much for the question. We've had great growth and fully accountable to membership, as we mentioned earlier, adding over 900,000 patients for the year. That growth is diverse across a number of payers. We have over 100 payer partners spanning both national and regional payers. And as we think about that growth, of course, UnitedHealthcare is a core partner to us, but we continue to have the strength of our medical groups and physician networks being incredibly attractive to other payers regionally and nationally to be able to grow in their own value-based arrangements to drive outcomes and total cost of care. So we look forward to continued growth in a broad-based diverse way.Andrew Philip WittyAmar, thank you. And thank you for the question. Jennifer, we'd take the last question now, please.OperatorOkay. We'll go last to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.Lance Arthur WilkesOn Medicaid and Medicaid redetermination, could you comment a little bit on the margin implications of the members that are getting redetermined off? Are you seeing a lot of double coverage or zero MOR on that?And then just in general, are enrollment -- disenrollment trends kind of consistent with your expectations? And do you see where those members are going to as far as individual employer are uninsured?Andrew Philip WittyLance, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to have Tim Spilker, who leads our community and state to respond to that. Tim?Timothy Elizabeth SpilkerYes. Thank you, Lance, for the question. And maybe I'll start with just the enrollment trends because I think that really informs a whole number of factors. So first off, what we're seeing, I think, consistent with what states have reported is significant disenrollment for procedural reasons and what's more -- a lot of variability, frankly, across states in terms of the pacing and enrollment and even states now that are suspending terminations or reenrolling members based on guidance. So those stops and starts certainly have an impact on our membership as well as membership mix. But frankly, that's why we continue to develop even more ways to engage members and support our states. Our goal really is to help individuals find coverage.And so a couple of points on that. Our retrade for the programs that we've implemented exceeds our traditional programs, and we're seeing strong re-enrollment rates between 15% and 20% depending on the state. And so as a result, as John mentioned in his comments, we're retaining a significant majority of the members we engage with certainly more to do. Then second, in terms of your question around just kind of outlook, again, I think the factors around the re-enrollment has an impact on just how we think about mix. But I think it's also important that to consider the rate environment, states are taking into account a thoughtful -- taking a thoughtful and data driven approach to rate setting. And with visibility now into around 45% of our revenue for '24, really appreciative of the approach that states are taking.So all in all, I would say both membership as well as our outlook is in line with what we expected at this point with a lot of variability. I think our membership looks good in terms of the outlook that we set at the beginning of the year. And at this point, still all this is manageable.Andrew Philip WittyTim, thanks so much. And thank all of you for your time this morning. I hope what you heard during today's call only reinforces what you've come to expect from UnitedHealth Group, an organization that's just as nimble and agile as it is focused and disciplined. Always growing, always innovating, seamlessly committed to our mission and deeply devoted to those we share. Thank you for your attention today, and we appreciate it.OperatorThis does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.]"
260,90787131-a60f-3323-88de-a8291582ee82,UNH,2023-10-14,Kaiser Permanente strike: Union reaches tentative deal,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/kaiser-permanente-strike-union-reaches-210119783.html,1697230879,VIDEO,['UNH'],"[Healthcare union workers reach a tentative deal with Kaiser Permanente after three days of striking. UNC Health and health insurance company UnitedHealthcare (UNH) have started contract negotiations as their contract expires on April 1, 2024.Yahoo Finance Health Reporter Anjalee Khemlani discusses the latest news in the healthcare sector. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- Tentative deal with Kaiser Permanente has been reached this morning. And given the current environment, a deal between the opposing sides after only three days of walkouts is pretty surprising. But the disruptions were extensive given how many areas of health care were impacted. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani to give us the details. Anjalee.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. Looking to hear this deal, or tentative agreement, now before another strike in November that was planned by these union workers. So let's take a look at what the tentative deal includes. That includes a pay raise, about $23 for minimum wage for workers in other states, 25 in California.21% wage increase in the next four years, increases in the performance sharing plan, and investments from Kaiser in job training and dealing with those staffing shortages that have been really the crux of the issue, including that cancelation of the November strike, and all of this to go in effect, if ratified, by those workers about 80,000 of those by October 18.And it would be back-- backdated to October 1. Now, this has really impacted a large swath of the country. We know Kaiser is one of the largest health systems. And it has affected four states in total, about 75,000 workers impacted. And it's caused delays in things like surgeries, chemotherapy. Non-urgent care has been largely impacted in some of the same ways that if you recall during the pandemic. There were delays for non-urgent care.Story continuesSo that's something that has been averted by this potential deal. And we'll have to keep an eye on it. As we know, labor shortages are a very big issue today for hospitals and health systems.- And Anjalee, hospital insurer contract negotiations are being widely reported this year. What's going on there?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. To my point just now about Kaiser, I mean, great news on the front of getting this deal in place. But if it were any other hospital system, they would then have to turn around and get that money for these increases form somewhere. And that somewhere is the payer. So the insurers. And so we're seeing that friction of what the hospital needs are around the country to continue to operate while also looking at what has happened post pandemic.During the pandemic, hospitals had to, like I mentioned before, really be fixed and create ways to work around the unprecedented demand on their systems. They got federal dollars in for some of the work they were doing. But with that gone away, they're faced with trying to balance out their balance sheets, essentially. They need to look at a way to make their hospital run efficiently, economically, and not run out of money, and maintain margins.So that's something that they're now fighting with insurers to increase their commercial rates, looking at ways with changes in some of the state laws, and federal laws, and payment models. A lot of stuff coming down on these health systems, and putting pressure on their revenues. And so how this all pans out with all of these negotiations going on is going to be something we'll have to take a look at definitely by the end of the year to see how many hospitals end up out of network, or how many contracts end up falling through.It's something that could potentially impact some specialties, or certain areas of the country, more than others. So we'll definitely have to keep an eye on thatJULIE HYMAN: Yes we will. Thanks so much, Anjalee. Really interesting stuff.]"

(NYSE:EL),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-est-e-140030975.html,1697205630,STORY,['EL'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Estée Lauder Companies fair value estimate is US$166Estée Lauder Companies' US$140 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimateOur fair value estimate is 9.1% lower than Estée Lauder Companies' analyst price target of US$183In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.44bUS$2.05bUS$2.86bUS$2.92bUS$3.30bUS$3.59bUS$3.83bUS$4.03bUS$4.20bUS$4.36bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x10Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 8.61%Est @ 6.67%Est @ 5.32%Est @ 4.37%Est @ 3.70% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$1.3kUS$1.8kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.4b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.2%) = US$81bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$81b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$39bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$60b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$140, the company appears about fair value at a 16% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Estée Lauder Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.102. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Estée Lauder CompaniesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Personal Products market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.5%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.12%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.23%.The world's largest consumer products maker's shares have seen a decrease of 7.4% over the last month, not keeping up with the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 6.27% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.4%.The upcoming earnings release of Procter &amp; Gamble will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on October 18, 2023. On that day, Procter &amp; Gamble is projected to report earnings of $1.71 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 8.92%. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $21.64 billion, indicating a 4.98% upward movement from the same quarter last year.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.38 per share and revenue of $85.38 billion, which would represent changes of +8.14% and +4.11%, respectively, from the prior year.Furthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Procter &amp; Gamble. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.The Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988.

Procter &amp; Gamble currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesLooking at its valuation, Procter &amp; Gamble is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 22.46. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 22.02, so one might conclude that Procter &amp; Gamble is trading at a premium comparatively.We can also see that PG currently has a PEG ratio of 3.28. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Soap and Cleaning Materials industry held an average PEG ratio of 3.36.The Soap and Cleaning Materials industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 228, which puts it in the bottom 10% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

The company is expected to deliver sales and earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.71 per share, indicating an 8.9% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. For fiscal first-quarter revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $21.64 billion, suggesting a 5% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.In the last reported quarter, the company recorded an earnings surprise of 3.8%. It has delivered a bottom-line beat of 2.4%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Procter &amp; Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise Procter &amp; Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS SurpriseProcter &amp; Gamble Company (The) price-eps-surprise | Procter &amp; Gamble Company (The) QuoteKey Factors to NoteProcter &amp; Gamble has been demonstrating its dominance in the global market by strategically leveraging its brand strength to drive organic sales growth. As a manufacturer of products catering to the essential daily needs of consumers worldwide, P&amp;G's success in the preceding quarters can be attributed to its robust brand portfolio and effective business strategies. The persistence of these trends is expected to get reflected in the company’s organic sales for the fiscal first quarter.We expect organic sales to increase 5.3% in the to-be-reported quarter. Organic sales are expected to increase 9% for the Beauty segment, 2% for Grooming, 2% for Fabric &amp; Home Care, 4% for Health Care, and 9% for the Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segment.P&amp;G has been diligently pursuing cost-saving and productivity measures to drive margins and reinforce its competitive advantage. The company's commitment to enhancing productivity while mitigating macro cost headwinds has been integral to maintaining a balanced top and bottom-line growth. Its focus on productivity and cost-saving plans are likely to have boosted margins in the to-be-reported quarter.We expect P&amp;G's core gross margin for the fiscal first quarter to have been influenced by significant productivity savings. Our model predicts a core gross margin expansion of 100 bps for the to-be-reported quarter. However, currency headwinds are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Rising input costs are expected to have partly weighed on the fiscal first-quarter performance. Additionally, Procter &amp; Gamble has been witnessing elevated SG&amp;A expenses due to higher supply-chain costs, rising inflation and elevated transportation expenses.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management pointed out that the ongoing supply-chain issues, higher transportation costs, geopolitical challenges, currency headwinds and rising inflation might continue to impact consumer confidence throughout fiscal 2024. The persistence of these headwinds is likely to get reflected in the company’s bottom-line performance to some extent.Our estimate indicates a 1% impact from currency headwinds in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Meanwhile, our estimate for core SG&amp;A expenses of $5.1 billion indicates a year-over-year rise of 6.3%. As a percentage of sales, core SG&amp;A expenses are estimated to reflect a 50-bps expansion from the year-ago quarter. Consequently, our model suggests a 50-bps operating margin expansion to 24.5% in the fiscal first quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Procter &amp; Gamble this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Stericycle and Waste Connections are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that SRCL's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.SRCL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 23.03, while WCN has a forward P/E of 32.77. We also note that SRCL has a PEG ratio of 2.88. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. WCN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.99.Another notable valuation metric for SRCL is its P/B ratio of 1.58. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, WCN has a P/B of 4.73.These metrics, and several others, help SRCL earn a Value grade of B, while WCN has been given a Value grade of D.Story continuesSRCL stands above WCN thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that SRCL is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For 10 years, Teosha was at Lola's side - to support and encourage her every step of the way through her cancer journey. Teosha was not only a friend to Lola, but also an advocate for breast cancer awareness and early detection. Sadly, Lola passed away. Soon after, Teosha had her first mammogram at age 38.Knowing your bodyA few months after the mammogram, Teosha noticed a lump in one of her breasts but dismissed it as scar tissue from a medical procedure two years prior. During a visit to the doctor for swimmer's ear, she mentioned the lump to her physician, who encouraged her to have it checked right away. On Sept. 18, 2018, Teosha was diagnosed with Stage 1A Progesterone Positive Breast Cancer.""I knew something wasn't right because I know my body. I discovered the lump after a self-check,"" said Teosha. ""Knowing your body is so important because it can help you talk to your doctor and get in front of something like breast cancer.""Walking through the darkness of breast cancerTeosha's type of cancer had the propensity to spread quickly. Her treatment journey began with eight rounds of aggressive chemotherapy followed by a double mastectomy. The treatment was challenging, both physically and mentally. The disruption of breast cancer had stripped her independence.""Before I was diagnosed, I was on the go. My three sons were really active in basketball and band. I was working full time. Everyone leaned on me,"" said Teosha. ""Honestly, some days I thought dying would have been easier than enduring the physical and mental fight cancer presented. There were sad, dark times and low valley moments. But then I realized I was not walking alone. It was hard for me to accept help, but I did, thanks to the encouragement of my mother. It was humbling as I began to lean on others.""Story continuesFinding light in the darknessTeosha's supporters rallied around her as she completed treatment, surgery and reconstruction. As her life was getting back on track, Teosha lost her father and faced other personal challenges that inspired her to shift her perspective.""After overcoming breast cancer and the other obstacles in my life, I found strength to become the best version of myself that I could be,"" said Teosha. ""Cancer changed me completely. I liked the old Teosha, but she was gone. I didn't have to be a diminished version of myself. I am different now, and that's okay. I am still Teosha but stronger than ever before!""Unapologetically, Totally TeoshaTeosha used to be her biggest critic. Now, she's her biggest fan.""I am not the person I was before cancer.

Sherwin-Williams (SHW), which belongs to the Zacks Paints and Related Products industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This paint and coatings maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 16.14%.For the most recent quarter, Sherwin-Williams was expected to post earnings of $2.71 per share, but it reported $3.29 per share instead, representing a surprise of 21.40%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.84 per share, while it actually produced $2.04 per share, a surprise of 10.87%.For Sherwin-Williams, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Sherwin-Williams has an Earnings ESP of +1.35% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 24, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

However, when several insiders are buying, like in the case of American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK), it sends a favourable message to the company's shareholders.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for American Water Works Company The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At American Water Works CompanyOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Independent Director Michael Marberry for US$199k worth of shares, at about US$142 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$118 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.American Water Works Company insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Have American Water Works Company Insiders Traded Recently?Over the last three months, we've seen a bit of insider buying at American Water Works Company. Independent Director Martha Goss bought US$7.9k worth of shares in that time. It's great to see that insiders are only buying, not selling. But in this case the amount purchased means the recent transaction may not be very meaningful on its own.Story continuesInsider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Insiders own 0.2% of American Water Works Company shares, worth about US$41m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About American Water Works Company Insiders?Insider purchases may have been minimal, in the last three months, but there was no selling at all. The net investment is not enough to encourage us much. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. Overall we don't see anything to make us think American Water Works Company insiders are doubting the company, and they do own shares. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing American Water Works Company. For example, American Water Works Company has 4 warning signs (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) we think you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The stock has declined 16.1% over the past four weeks. However, given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround.How to Determine if a Stock is OversoldWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Here's Why AWK Could Experience a TurnaroundThe heavy selling of AWK shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 29.43. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering AWK in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0.1% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, AWK currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

(NASDAQ:PEP) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 74% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-inc-nasdaq-pep-largely-110022251.html,1697281222,STORY,['PEP'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies PepsiCo's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 25 shareholders own 41% of the companyOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockIf you want to know who really controls PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 74% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about PepsiCo. Check out our latest analysis for PepsiCo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PepsiCo?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.PepsiCo already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at PepsiCo's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in PepsiCo. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.0% and 4.3% of the stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of PepsiCoThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of PepsiCo, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$300m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 26% stake in PepsiCo. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for PepsiCo   you should know about.Ultimately the future is most important.
