Although prices were relatively low, insiders chose to sell US$138m worth of stock in the past 12 months. This could be a sign of impending weakness.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Charles Schwab Charles Schwab Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Founder &amp; Co-Chairman, Charles Schwab, sold US$19m worth of shares at a price of US$69.43 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$80.19. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 0.2% of Charles Schwab's stake.All up, insiders sold more shares in Charles Schwab than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Charles Schwab insiders own 6.0% of the company, currently worth about US$9.4b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Charles Schwab Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Charles Schwab insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Charles Schwab. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Charles Schwab you should know about.Of course Charles Schwab may not be the best stock to buy.

(NYSE:TMO) Investors Are Less Pessimistic Than Expected,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-inc-nyse-130102353.html,1667048462,STORY,['TMO'],"[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 28.2x Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Thermo Fisher Scientific hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Thermo Fisher Scientific will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?Thermo Fisher Scientific's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 17% decrease to the company's bottom line. Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 99% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a very good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 9.9% per year over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.9% growth each year, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.With this information, we find it interesting that Thermo Fisher Scientific is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Our examination of Thermo Fisher Scientific's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.It is also worth noting that we have found 2 warning signs for Thermo Fisher Scientific that you need to take into consideration.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with strong recent earnings growth (and a P/E ratio below 20x).Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

(NYSE:MMC) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies has been doing relatively well. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies peKeen to find out how analysts think Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 26%. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 130% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 5.5% each year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 9.9% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's alarming that Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company are way more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock at any price. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Final WordWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Our examination of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies' analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E anywhere near as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.Before you take the next step, you should know about the 1 warning sign for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies that we have uncovered.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

If you want to see more of the best insurance dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Insurance Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.Interest rates have risen substantially in 2022. To fight inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times this year alone, with the last three raises at a pretty steep 0.75 percentage points each. As a result, the federal funds rate is now 3% to 3.25%, which is substantially higher than what it was at the beginning of the year. The interest rate hikes might not be over as many expect the federal funds rate to be between 4% and 4.5% by the end of the year.Like they have in many other sectors, the rising interest rates have affected the insurance industry.According to the Office of Financial Research,Modestly rising interest rates are generally positive for the insurance industry. When rates rise at a reasonable pace, portfolio yields also rise. With these new, higher-yielding corporate and other bond purchases, insurers’ investment earnings also increase. Life insurers, in particular, benefit from a rising interest rate environment as they’re likely to earn improved spreads over the cost of funding liabilities.As a result of the higher rates, some insurance companies have an easier time earning profits and shares of those companies have outperformed the market this year.If inflation becomes too much of a problem, however, many insurers could also face headwinds, especially P&amp;C insurers. The Office of Financial Research added,Adding inflation to the mix, however, affects insurers differently. For example, while property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurers also benefit from increased bond portfolio yields, higher-than-expected claim costs for home, automobile, and other insurance lines may impair earnings.Similarly, if interest rates rise too much, the U.S. economy could enter into a deeper than expected recession and demand for insurance products could decrease.Story continuesGiven the uncertainty in the markets today, it can be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.In terms of the insurance sector, here are 11 stocks with dividends to consider,Dividend Money, High DividendsCopyright: mozakim / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyFor the list of 11 Best Insurance Dividend Stocks To Buy Now, we took many of the largest insurance companies by market cap that are listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ and that also paid dividends.

(NYSE:SLF) trades for a price to book value of 1.32. On 10/12 John Aiken of Barclays cut his price target to C$63 from C$67 on Sun Life Financial Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Salesforce The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SalesforceThe Co-Founder, Marc Benioff, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$53m worth of shares at a price of US$182 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$163. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Salesforce insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Salesforce insiders own 3.1% of the company, currently worth about US$5.1b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Salesforce Insiders?The fact that there have been no Salesforce insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Salesforce, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

(NASDAQ:PAYX)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-paychex-inc-145649378.html,1667055409,STORY,['PAYX'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Paychex Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.78bUS$1.70bUS$2.06bUS$2.20bUS$2.37bUS$2.49bUS$2.60bUS$2.69bUS$2.77bUS$2.85bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.28%Est @ 4.29%Est @ 3.6%Est @ 3.11%Est @ 2.77% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% US$1.7kUS$1.5kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$16bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.7%– 2.0%) = US$62bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$62b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$32bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$48b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$120, the company appears about fair value at a 11% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Paychex as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.008. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

See our latest analysis for Starbucks Starbucks Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Founder &amp; Director Howard Schultz for US$10.0m worth of shares, at about US$73.10 per share. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (US$87.10), we still think insider buying is a positive. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 274.75k shares worth US$21m. On the other hand they divested 26.96k shares, for US$3.0m. Overall, Starbucks insiders were net buyers during the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeStarbucks is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Starbucks Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last quarter, Starbucks insiders have spent a meaningful amount on shares. Not only was there no selling that we can see, but they collectively bought US$6.0m worth of shares. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Starbucks insiders own about US$2.1b worth of shares (which is 2.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Starbucks Insiders?The recent insider purchases are heartening. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. Along with the high insider ownership, this analysis suggests that insiders are quite bullish about Starbucks. Nice! In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Starbucks. To help with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs (2 are significant!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Starbucks.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

However, if you’re going to hold forever, quality counts. For this reason, I’m going with the S&amp;P 500.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTo narrow my choices to seven, I’ve limited my selections to the companies that have grown their dividends per share by more than 10% in the past 18 months.

The annual payment of 76 cents yields a low 0.60%. Why am I selecting a stock that yields less than 1%?Potential capital appreciation, that’s why. Over the past 10 years, EA generated an annualized total return of 26.2%, more than double the U.S. market.As I write this on Oct. 25, Electronic Arts is days away from announcing its second quarter 2023 quarterly results.

The annual payment of $4 yields a reasonable 1.4%. In April, Charlie Bilello listed the top 20 performing S&amp;P 500 stocks over the past five, 10, 15, and 20 years. POOL made the 10-year list, up 1,215%. Over the past five years, it has had an annualized total return of 20.2%, more than double the U.S. market.And that’s despite a year-to-date total return of nearly 48%.Pool Corp. is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pools and related outdoor living products.

The annual payment of 75 cents yields a reasonable 1.1%. I know what you’re thinking. You’re wondering why the maker of Jack Daniel’s and many other fine alcoholic beverages made the cut when it increased the dividend by less than 10%.A day later, on Dec. 29, 2021, it paid a  special dividend of $1 a share, making the total payout $1.1885 a share, 562% higher than the regular payment of $0.1795.I’m a big fan of special dividends. As far back as 2012, I’m on record endorsing the capital allocation practice. It’s an example of a shareholder-friendly company.In early October, Brown-Forman made a big announcement. It was buying Venezuela rum brand Diplomático. While no terms were revealed, the move makes the company a leader in the super-premium rum category.Diplomático’s top markets include the U.S. and Germany. It is sold in more than 100 countries worldwide. To date, Brown-Forman didn’t own a rum brand. This puts in a very upscale crowd.The  20 analysts covering BF-B stock give it a hold rating with a $73.06 target price.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp.

When the oil and gas producer announced the increase in February, it pointed out that it would continue to grow the quarterly dividend as its balance sheet strengthened. It is part of CEO Vicki Hollub’s plan to reward shareholders like Warren Buffett for sticking with it.OXY stock had a good year in the markets. It’s up more than 128% YTD. That puts it up for the past five years. It last traded this high in November 2018.Occidental reports Q3 2022 results on Nov. 9. It is expected to earn $2.50 a share in the third quarter.

Rowe Price can do when the markets are in correction mode. When you’re an asset manager in down times, you can only hope that the markets turn higher at some point.In mid-October, the company reported its month-end assets for September. They were  $1.23 trillion, with outflows in the third quarter of $24.6 billion. YTD’s outflows were $44.6 billion, or just 3.6% of its assets under management.The  15 analysts covering TROW stock give it an underweight rating with a $95.50 target price.While the analysts don’t like it, it is still expected to earn $7.87 in 2022. That’s less than 14x earnings. Further, the company’s current earnings yield — the inverse of the P/E ratio — is  9.93%, the highest it’s been in the past decade.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comFreeport-McMoRan  (NYSE:FCX) raised its dividend by 100.0% with the February 2022 payment to $0.15 a share. The annual payment of 60 cents yields a reasonable 1.9%.  The company’s stock price jumped on Oct. 20 after the company announced better-than-expected Q3 2022 results.Due to a 30% decline in copper prices since March, the company’s third-quarter profit fell by 71% to $404 million from $1.4 billion a year ago. On a per-share basis, it earned 28 cents a share in the quarter, two cents better than the consensus estimate.Despite the negative view by investors about copper, the company has said that demand remains very strong. CEO Richard Adkerson stated in FCX’s Q3 2022 press release:“Despite near-term uncertainties, the long-term market fundamentals and value opportunities for our stakeholders remain highly attractive. I am confident that our strategy centered on being Foremost in Copper will be positive for all stakeholders as global conditions improve.”The  21 analysts covering FCX stock give it an overweight rating with a $35.98 target price.Down nearly 24% YTD, FCX remains well below its 52-week high of $51.99.Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold: Extra Space Storage (EXR)Extra Space Storage (EXR) facility exterior and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comExtra Space Storage  (NYSE:EXR) raised its dividend by 20.0% with the March 2022 payment to $1.50 a share.

20,c0ca5ccc-9ce3-386e-9733-7467d867c205,XEL,2022-10-30,"With EPS Growth And More, Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) Makes An Interesting Case",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eps-growth-more-xcel-energy-125544832.html,1667048144,STORY,['XEL'],"[Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Xcel Energy How Fast Is Xcel Energy Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Over the last three years, Xcel Energy has grown EPS by 6.8% per year. This may not be setting the world alight, but it does show that EPS is on the upwards trend.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note Xcel Energy achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 12% to US$15b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Xcel Energy's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are Xcel Energy Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Xcel Energy has a market capitalisation of US$36b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at US$40m. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Despite being just 0.1% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.Story continuesWhile it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Xcel Energy, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m.Xcel Energy offered total compensation worth US$8.4m to its CEO in the year to December 2021. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Is Xcel Energy Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for Xcel Energy is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. The growth of EPS may be the eye-catching headline for Xcel Energy, but there's more to bring joy for shareholders. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 2 warning signs for Xcel Energy (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

(NYSE:HCA)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-still-lacking-conviction-hca-140039358.html,1667052039,STORY,['HCA'],"[HCA Healthcare, Inc.'s (NYSE:HCA) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 11.9x might make it look like a buy right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios above 15x and even P/E's above 28x are quite common. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/E.HCA Healthcare hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. It seems that many are expecting the dour earnings performance to persist, which has repressed the P/E. If this is the case, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on HCA Healthcare.How Is HCA Healthcare's Growth Trending?HCA Healthcare's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver limited growth, and importantly, perform worse than the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 8.7% decrease to the company's bottom line. Even so, admirably EPS has lifted 83% in aggregate from three years ago, notwithstanding the last 12 months. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 8.4% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be similar to the 9.9% each year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we find it odd that HCA Healthcare is trading at a P/E lower than the market. It may be that most investors are not convinced the company can achieve future growth expectations.What We Can Learn From HCA Healthcare's P/E?It's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Story continuesOur examination of HCA Healthcare's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't contributing to its P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we assume potential risks are what might be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. At least the risk of a price drop looks to be subdued, but investors seem to think future earnings could see some volatility.It is also worth noting that we have found 3 warning signs for HCA Healthcare (1 is significant!) that you need to take into consideration.If you're unsure about the strength of HCA Healthcare's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

However, if you’re going to hold forever, quality counts. For this reason, I’m going with the S&amp;P 500.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTo narrow my choices to seven, I’ve limited my selections to the companies that have grown their dividends per share by more than 10% in the past 18 months. Further, I’ve picked one stock from seven different sectors to provide some diversification.I do not doubt that these seven dividend stocks to buy and hold forever will get the job done, delivering more than adequate long-term returns for investors.Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold: Electronic Arts (EA)Electronic Arts logo on a wallSource: Rick Neves / Shutterstock.comWith the June 2022 dividend payment, Electronic Arts  (NASDAQ:EA) raised its dividend by 11.8% to  19 cents a share. The annual payment of 76 cents yields a low 0.60%. Why am I selecting a stock that yields less than 1%?Potential capital appreciation, that’s why. Over the past 10 years, EA generated an annualized total return of 26.2%, more than double the U.S. market.As I write this on Oct. 25, Electronic Arts is days away from announcing its second quarter 2023 quarterly results. Analyst estimates suggest it will probably deliver lower revenues and earnings from Q2 2022.Not to worry, you’re buying EA stock to buy and hold forever.On Oct. 7, Electronic Arts launched its new EA app for Windows. It replaces Origin on PC, which started way back in  2011. The company listened to feedback from the gaming community before moving the replacement out of its beta phase.“The EA app is our fastest and lightest PC client to date,” the company stated in its blog post announcing the launch.Story continuesThe 30 analysts covering EA stock give it an overweight rating with a $153 target price.Pool Corporation (POOL)Yellow pool float, ring floating in a refreshing blue swimming poolSource: ShutterstockWith the  May 2022 dividend payment, Pool Corporation  (NASDAQ:POOL) raised its dividend by 25.0% to $1 a share. The annual payment of $4 yields a reasonable 1.4%. In April, Charlie Bilello listed the top 20 performing S&amp;P 500 stocks over the past five, 10, 15, and 20 years. POOL made the 10-year list, up 1,215%. Over the past five years, it has had an annualized total return of 20.2%, more than double the U.S. market.And that’s despite a year-to-date total return of nearly 48%.Pool Corp. is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pools and related outdoor living products. It has more than 410 sales centers on three continents.The company reported  Q3 2022 earnings on Oct. 20, which included going over $5 billion in YTD sales, with the fourth quarter still playing out.“We’ve observed increased demand for higher value products and customizations for new pools and remodeling projects, even though the issuance of new pool permits year-to-date has moderated,” stated CEO Peter D. Arvan in its Q3 2022 press release.Over the years, I’ve learned one thing: If you own a house with a pool, you’re not going to sell it if you don’t maintain it. It’s that simple.The  11 analysts covering POOL stock give it an overweight rating with a $350 target price.Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold: Brown-Forman (BF-B)Person holding cellphone with logo of American spirits company Brown-Forman (BF-B) Corporation on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comWith the Dec. 28, 2021 dividend payment, Brown-Forman  (NYSE:BF-B) raised its dividend by 5.0% to $0.1885 a share. The annual payment of 75 cents yields a reasonable 1.1%. I know what you’re thinking. You’re wondering why the maker of Jack Daniel’s and many other fine alcoholic beverages made the cut when it increased the dividend by less than 10%.A day later, on Dec. 29, 2021, it paid a  special dividend of $1 a share, making the total payout $1.1885 a share, 562% higher than the regular payment of $0.1795.I’m a big fan of special dividends. As far back as 2012, I’m on record endorsing the capital allocation practice. It’s an example of a shareholder-friendly company.In early October, Brown-Forman made a big announcement. It was buying Venezuela rum brand Diplomático. While no terms were revealed, the move makes the company a leader in the super-premium rum category.Diplomático’s top markets include the U.S. and Germany. It is sold in more than 100 countries worldwide. To date, Brown-Forman didn’t own a rum brand. This puts in a very upscale crowd.The  20 analysts covering BF-B stock give it a hold rating with a $73.06 target price.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum  (NYSE:OXY) raised its dividend by 1,200% with the April 2022 payment of $0.13 a share. The annual payment of 52 cents yields a low 0.70%. When the oil and gas producer announced the increase in February, it pointed out that it would continue to grow the quarterly dividend as its balance sheet strengthened. It is part of CEO Vicki Hollub’s plan to reward shareholders like Warren Buffett for sticking with it.OXY stock had a good year in the markets. It’s up more than 128% YTD. That puts it up for the past five years. It last traded this high in November 2018.Occidental reports Q3 2022 results on Nov. 9. It is expected to earn $2.50 a share in the third quarter. The analyst estimate for all of 2022 is  $10.22 a share. That’s less than 7x earnings.Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) owns 26.8% of its stock, including  83.9 million warrants to buy shares — with authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to buy up to 50% of the company. Assuming the warrants are exercised, Berkshire would earn more than $141 million in annual dividends from its investment.The  28 analysts covering OXY stock give it a hold rating with a $73.93 target price. The analysts might not like it, but the Oracle of Omaha sure does.Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold: T. Rowe Price (TROW)T row price (TROW) logo magnified through a lens while displayed on a web browserSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comT. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) raised its dividend by 11.1% with the March 2022 payment to $1.20 a share. The annual payment of $4.80 yields a high 4.4%. A year ago, in July, T. Rowe Price paid a juicy $3 a share special dividend.Sure, its stock is down more than 44% YTD and 48% over the past year, but if you have owned TROW stock since June 2021, you’ve collected $9.84 in dividends over 17 months.I’ll take that every day of the week and twice on Sundays.There’s not much T. Rowe Price can do when the markets are in correction mode. When you’re an asset manager in down times, you can only hope that the markets turn higher at some point.In mid-October, the company reported its month-end assets for September. They were  $1.23 trillion, with outflows in the third quarter of $24.6 billion. YTD’s outflows were $44.6 billion, or just 3.6% of its assets under management.The  15 analysts covering TROW stock give it an underweight rating with a $95.50 target price.While the analysts don’t like it, it is still expected to earn $7.87 in 2022. That’s less than 14x earnings. Further, the company’s current earnings yield — the inverse of the P/E ratio — is  9.93%, the highest it’s been in the past decade.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comFreeport-McMoRan  (NYSE:FCX) raised its dividend by 100.0% with the February 2022 payment to $0.15 a share. The annual payment of 60 cents yields a reasonable 1.9%.  The company’s stock price jumped on Oct. 20 after the company announced better-than-expected Q3 2022 results.Due to a 30% decline in copper prices since March, the company’s third-quarter profit fell by 71% to $404 million from $1.4 billion a year ago. On a per-share basis, it earned 28 cents a share in the quarter, two cents better than the consensus estimate.Despite the negative view by investors about copper, the company has said that demand remains very strong. CEO Richard Adkerson stated in FCX’s Q3 2022 press release:“Despite near-term uncertainties, the long-term market fundamentals and value opportunities for our stakeholders remain highly attractive. I am confident that our strategy centered on being Foremost in Copper will be positive for all stakeholders as global conditions improve.”The  21 analysts covering FCX stock give it an overweight rating with a $35.98 target price.Down nearly 24% YTD, FCX remains well below its 52-week high of $51.99.Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold: Extra Space Storage (EXR)Extra Space Storage (EXR) facility exterior and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comExtra Space Storage  (NYSE:EXR) raised its dividend by 20.0% with the March 2022 payment to $1.50 a share. The annual payment of $6 yields a healthy 3.5%.  The Salt Lake City-based REIT (real estate investment trust) owned and/or operated 2,177 self-storage properties in the U.S., representing 168 million square feet of rentable storage space.On Sept. 16, it announced the acquisition of 107 Storage Express properties in Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, and Kentucky. It paid  $590 million for the properties and other corporate assets. As part of the acquisition, it also acquired E-Tracker, Storage Express’s software operating platform.Acquisitions are the norm for companies in the self-storage industry. Extra Space Storage is no exception. In the past five years, it’s spent more than  $1 billion annually in both 2021 and 2021 and more than $500 million in 2018.In 2022, the REIT expects its core FFO (funds from operations) of $8.40 a share at the midpoint of its guidance, with 17% same-store revenue growth over 2021. The REIT’s total debt at the end of Q2 2022 was $6.88 billion, a low 34% of its $20.24 billion in total assets.The  15 analysts covering EXR stock give it an overweight rating with a $222.50 target price, 28% higher than its current share price.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to see more of the biggest internet companies in the world, go directly to 5 Biggest Internet Companies in the World.The internet has grown substantially over the past few decades.According to the IDC, there were only 16 million users of the internet at the end of 1995, representing around 0.4% of the world's population. Due to cheaper computers, rising incomes, and more utility online, however, the number of people who used the internet rose to 248 million at the end of 1999, representing 4.1% of the world's population.Although the internet bubble burst in 2000, the number of internet users continued to grow. With more organic growth, the number of internet users surpassed 1 billion in 2005 and 5 billion in 2020. As of July 2022, there are 5.473 billion internet users representing about 69% of the world's population according to Internet World Stats.With advancements in technology, there will likely be even more internet users in the future.One potential way to deliver more internet to the world are satellites. A leader in satellite internet Starlink describes its services, ""Starlink is the world's first and largest satellite constellation using a low Earth orbit to deliver broadband internet capable of supporting streaming, online gaming, video calls and more. Leveraging advanced satellites and user hardware coupled with our deep experience with both spacecraft and on-orbit operations, Starlink delivers high-speed, low-latency internet to users all over the world.""With Starlink, it's possible to attain high speed broadband from space. Starlink already has more than 2,000 satellites in space that collectively offer service in 32 nations. Starlink also benefits given that it's a division of SpaceX, which has substantial experience in launching rockets. Starlink adds, ""Starlink is ideally suited for areas of the globe where connectivity has typically been a challenge. Unbounded by traditional ground infrastructure, Starlink can deliver high-speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable or completely unavailable.""Story continuesAlthough Starlink is expensive for many places in the world given its current monthly cost and also the hardware costs for the satellite dish and router, the costs could decrease substantially in the future as more people use it. Other companies could also potentially decide to subsidize it or an alternative version of low orbit satellite internet to potentially gain more users.With more people on the internet, there's potential for bigger markets and more growth for internet companies. With more potential revenues, there's also potential for more profits.Given the growth of the internet in the past few decades, some internet companies have expanded substantially in scale and market capitalization. As a result, some of the largest internet companies are worth over $100 billion in market capitalization and two are worth over $1 trillion.20222022 has been a pretty challenging year for the markets given that the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates 5 times already. With inflation remaining high, many expect the U.S. central bank to increase rates further by the end of the year.Given the headwinds, many of the world's biggest internet companies have also been affected. With the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list, we took the top 15 companies by market capitalization from companiesmarketcap.com's Largest internet companies by market cap list.For our data, we used companiesmarketcap.com's data for market capitalization and we used the number of hedge funds in our database of 895 funds that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q2 2022 for number of hedge fund holders.15 Biggest Internet Companies in the World15.

(NASDAQ:EQIX) is a datacenter REIT that hosts much of the infrastructure needed for companies to provide digital services online. Although shares have done well since 2012, Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) stock is down about 33% year to date due to the higher interest rates and other headwinds. With the expected continued growth of the internet, Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) has more growth in the long term, however.Alongside Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) is among the 15 biggest internet companies in the world in terms of market capitalization.14. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Market Capitalization as of 10/29: $54.44 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 129Uber Technologies, Inc.

Although analysts don't expect the company to make a profit yet in terms of next year EPS, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)'s losses have decreased over the years and the company is closer to profitability than before. If Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) continues innovating, the company has potential for more growth as well.13. JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD)Market Capitalization as of 10/29: $59.38 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 62JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) is a leading Chinese e-commerce company. Given the macro headwinds as well as potential delisting concerns, shares of JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) have fallen 45% year to date. With the e-commerce market in China no longer growing the way it did before, JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) will need to innovate to meet growth expectations.12. Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD)Market Capitalization as of 10/29: $66.94 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) is another Chinese e-commerce company that has faced macro headwinds such as lockdowns and slowing economic growth. Like other Chinese companies, Pinduoduo Inc.

(NASDAQ:ABNB)Market Capitalization as of 10/29: $73.67 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is a leading online short term home stay marketplace. In 2022, shares of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) have fallen 31% year to date due to concern that a potential recession could lower demand for travel and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)'s services.

(NASDAQ:BKNG)Market Capitalization as of 10/29: $74.31 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 93Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) is a leading travel and restaurant online reservation provider. Although shares have more than doubled from 2012, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG)'s stock is down 22% year to date given the economic headwinds. If a recession occurs next year, travel demand could decrease at least in the near term. With the decline, however, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) trades for a forward P/E of 15.34, which could be attractive if the company meets its earnings growth expectations for the future.9. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Market Capitalization as of 10/29: $84.92 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 99ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud company that offers a digital platform whose core capabilities can ""digitize, connect, and automate siloed processes to make work flow."" Given the company's value proposition, 80% of the Fortune 500 work with ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). Although shares are down 35% year to date, analyst expect ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) to grow earnings fairly quickly over the next five years. As of 10/29, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) had a market capitalization of $84.92 billion, ranking it #9 on our list of 15 Biggest Internet Companies in the World.8. MeituanMarket Capitalization as of 10/29: $96.03 billionMeituan is a Chinese e-commerce platform for services. According to Bloomberg, Meituan is studying potentially expanding into Hong Kong and international markets given slowing growth in China.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) is an online payments company whose shares have fallen 54% this year due to the broader market weakness. As a result of the decline, Paypal now trades at a forward P/E of 18.05, which could be attractive if interest rates don't rise too much further and the company maintains its market share in terms of online payments.Although the company's userbase isn't growing as fast as previously expected, Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) hopes to realize more revenue per user to help growth.6. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Market Capitalization as of 10/29: $131.6 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 95Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a leading internet streamer. Although shares of the stock are still down 51% year to date, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has rallied substantially from its May levels as the market becomes more optimistic that the company will be able to maintain its userbase despite increasing competition. An ad-supported tier could also help in terms of the number of users.Like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Netflix hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Netflix peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Netflix will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Is There Enough Growth For Netflix?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Netflix's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Taking a look back first, we see that there was hardly any earnings per share growth to speak of for the company over the past year. Although pleasingly EPS has lifted 251% in aggregate from three years ago, notwithstanding the last 12 months. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 12% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be similar to the 9.9% per year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we find it interesting that Netflix is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.We've established that Netflix currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.Many other vital risk factors can be found on the company's balance sheet.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 largest gas station chains in the US.Gas stations in the United States are a major industry in and of themselves, and integral to the revenue and profits of the major oil and gas companies running them. According to Ibis World, the United States gas station industry is worth more than $138 billion, providing employment to hundreds of thousands of people across the country. The lonely gas station in an otherwise abandoned area has provided the backdrop to many movies and is an iconic image in and of itself.Unlike most European countries, the United States is absolutely huge. Many states alone are bigger than some European countries which is why while public transport is a very efficient means of travel in the European regions, it is not as easily implementable in the United States. Further, while European cities are often built and amended to facilitate its citizens and allow for better public transport, cycling routes and pedestrian areas, U.S. cities, thanks to lobbying by major automakers in the country, are built to accommodate roads and cars, which is why cars are in huge demand in the country. Additionally, while most European governments are emphasizing on using alternative fuel to power automobiles, in addition to reducing the number of cars, diesel is still king in the United States and while alternative fuels are being implemented, the pace is slow and not making a significant impact in the near future. All of this shows why gas stations are so integral to the United States and why they are an entire industry.In fact, such is the importance of gas prices in the country, that the outlook of Americans on their country rises and fall in accordance with the rise and fall in gas prices. If gas prices go up, there is greater fear that the country is on an uncertain path with vice versa holding true too. 2022 has been an uncertain year for the biggest superpower in the world and economic uncertainty has increased with inflation rising to near record levels and the threat of a recession looming over every decision the country makes. Gas prices have been notoriously high as well with one of the main reasons being the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has led to sanctions against one of the world's biggest oil and gas producer, leading to gas prices rising across the world. The United States was no exception with the national average price of gas in the country crossing $5 per gallon in June, before decreasing in subsequent months and leveling off. Since most people do not have an alternative to cars because of scant public transport, they have no choice but to allow gas prices to take up a bigger chunk of their total savings. While in the case of other products having their prices increased, people can opt for cheaper substitutes or just reduce their spending on that specific product, this is not true for gas as there aren't really any alternatives to driving.Story continuesThe psychological impacts of gas prices increasing are numerous as well. An economist with the Philadelphia Fed learned that people who were teenagers during the gas price shocks in the 1970s drove less even 20 years later as this is the first major product spend for most teenagers and if the cost is significantly high, they may be more averse to spending on it even if their level of disposable income increases.There is another reason to be wary of gas prices in the future: OPEC+ recently announced that they're going to be decreasing output by 2 million barrels a day. This was despite talks between Saudi Arabia and the United States continuing to ensure that oil supply was adequate so as to not increase price, and despite the latter being hopeful of an increase in output, OPEC+ contravened the wishes of the United States and decreased output, which can have additional ramifications as the United States considers sanctions against Saudia Arabia.According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, there is a potential of disruptions in the petroleum supply chain and the slower than expected oil production growth could lead to increasing oil prices in winter, when demand is higher. However, a slower than expected economic growth rate could lead to a decrease in oil prices. U.S. production meanwhile is expected to be around 11.7 million barrels per day and 12.4 million barrels per day in 2023, which will easily beat the record highs set in 2019, before the pandemic wreaked havoc globally. Further, the expected gas price in the U.S. is $3.8 per gallon in Q4 of 2022 and $3.57 in 2023, well below the frightening high of over $5 per gallon in June 2022. Despite the dependence on gas, the expected gasoline consumption in the United States is expected to decline in 2022 as compared to 2021, with consumption being 8.8 million barrels per day, 40,000 barrels per day less than as compared to 2021 and expected to remain at similar levels throughout 2023. The main reason behind declining consumption is increasing fuel efficiency, which has more than offset the increase in prices and rising demand.The biggest gas station chains in the U.S. are operated by some of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world, each maintaining thousands of locations across the country. Together, the 10 biggest gas stations in the country operate more than 50,000 gas stations with a presence in most states and thousands of cities. Most of these gas stations will be familiar to you and odds are you've likely used one or more of these gas stations in your travels. Our rankings are based on both the number of gas stations each company operates along with the number of cities it operates in, with 70% weightage being assigned to the former and 30% to the latter. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the gas stations you're most likely to end up at when needing to refill your car, starting with number 10:10. Murphy USA Inc. (NYSE:MUSA)Number of stations in the U.S.: 1,532Number of cities present in: 1,029Murphy USA Inc. (NYSE:MUSA) is headquartered in Arkansas and unlike most of our entries, is not an oil and gas companies, instead just operating gas stations after spinning off from Murphy Oil. Texas is the state with the most Murphy USA Inc. (NYSE:MUSA) gas stations comprising 22% of all gas stations operated by Murphy USA Inc. (NYSE:MUSA).9. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)Number of stations in the U.S.: 1,755Number of cities present in: 930ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is an American giant which has operations in 15 countries with half of all production coming from the U.S. alone. Colorado is ConocoPhillips's (NYSE:COP) preferred state and has around 23% of all ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) gas stations.8. 76Number of stations in the U.S.: 2,071Number of cities present in: 933Owned by Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), 76 is one of the biggest gas station chains in the U.S. and operates predominantly in Chicago which makes up nearly half of all 76 gas stations.7. Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX)Number of stations in the U.S.: 2,474Number of cities present in: 1,151The only company with two entries in our list, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) operates two gas station chains under the name of Phillips 66 and 76. Missouri is the dominant state which around a fifth of all Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) gas stations in the country.6.

This means the annual payment is 5.1% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Newmont Newmont Is Paying Out More Than It Is EarningIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Before making this announcement, Newmont's dividend was higher than its profits, but the free cash flows quite comfortably covered it. Generally, we think cash is more important than accounting measures of profit, so with the cash flows easily covering the dividend, we don't think there is much reason to worry.Earnings per share is forecast to rise by 90.0% over the next year. If the dividend continues on its recent course, the payout ratio in 12 months could be 178%, which is a bit high and could start applying pressure to the balance sheet.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.40 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.20. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 4.6% per annum over that time. The dividend has seen some fluctuations in the past, so even though the dividend was raised this year, we should remember that it has been cut in the past.Newmont Might Find It Hard To Grow Its DividendGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. It's encouraging to see that Newmont has been growing its earnings per share at 67% a year over the past five years. Although earnings per share is up nicely Newmont is paying out 236% of its earnings as dividends, which we feel is borderline unsustainable without extenuating circumstances.Our Thoughts On Newmont's DividendOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great. We don't think Newmont is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Case in point: We've spotted 4 warning signs for Newmont (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.

(NYSE:ZTS) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 16% in that time. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been very strong. It's fair to say most would be happy with 123% the gain in that time. Generally speaking the long term returns will give you a better idea of business quality than short periods can. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 29% decline over the last twelve months.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. View our latest analysis for Zoetis To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Zoetis managed to grow its earnings per share at 20% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 17% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Zoetis has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Zoetis' TSR for the last 5 years was 130%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Zoetis shareholders are down 29% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 21%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 18% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Zoetis   you should know about.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

34,ddafc96b-0454-3e29-8b53-b96ad5e1b42c,NEE,2022-10-30,Some Investors May Be Worried About NextEra Energy's (NYSE:NEE) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-may-worried-nextera-energys-120242701.html,1667131362,STORY,"['NEE', 'NEE-PR']","[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Having said that, from a first glance at NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for NextEra Energy, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.026 = US$3.4b ÷ (US$156b - US$28b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, NextEra Energy has an ROCE of 2.6%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Electric Utilities industry average of 4.5%. See our latest analysis for NextEra Energy roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for NextEra Energy compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at NextEra Energy, we didn't gain much confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 5.6%, but since then they've fallen to 2.6%. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.Our Take On NextEra Energy's ROCEWhile returns have fallen for NextEra Energy in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 132% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So should these growth trends continue, we'd be optimistic on the stock going forward.Story continuesSince virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for NextEra Energy   (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should know about.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Mastercard’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Mastercard What Is Mastercard Worth?Good news, investors! Mastercard is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $423.53, but it is currently trading at US$329 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Mastercard’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Mastercard?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 58% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Mastercard. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since MA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MA for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy MA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of QUALCOMMMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that QUALCOMM insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$154m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The QUALCOMM Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no QUALCOMM insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of QUALCOMM insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for QUALCOMM you should be aware of, and 1 of them shouldn't be ignored.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after investigating WEC Energy Group (NYSE:WEC), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for WEC Energy Group:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.054 = US$1.9b ÷ (US$40b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Therefore, WEC Energy Group has an ROCE of 5.4%. On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 4.7%. Check out our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group roceIn the above chart we have measured WEC Energy Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering WEC Energy Group here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For WEC Energy Group Tell Us?The returns on capital haven't changed much for WEC Energy Group in recent years. The company has consistently earned 5.4% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 29% in that time. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.The Key TakeawayAs we've seen above, WEC Energy Group's returns on capital haven't increased but it is reinvesting in the business. Since the stock has gained an impressive 56% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Story continuesSince virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for WEC Energy Group   (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you should know about.While WEC Energy Group may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Apartheid in South Africa gave wealth and advantage to white citizens and closing that gap remains a goal, Phaahla said.""Over many years, certain universities benefited ... which were only open for white people. They build a lot of capacity. Some of them have huge reserves and investments because they've also been linked to industries, which were largely white-controlled, to big mining companies.

But a manufacturing issue with Emergent Biosolutions (EBS) caused a delay in the raw material needed to fill and finish doses in South Africa, and when doses began to arrive earlier this year, the cold chain had been broken.Phaahla credited South African President Cyril Ramaphosa for fighting against the exports, which could have given the African continent a chance to vaccinate more quickly.Story continuesHe hopes the message that South Africa is ready to grow will be heard.""We'd want to continue to advocate and hopefully we will make better progress.

However, if you’re going to hold forever, quality counts. For this reason, I’m going with the S&amp;P 500.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTo narrow my choices to seven, I’ve limited my selections to the companies that have grown their dividends per share by more than 10% in the past 18 months.

The annual payment of 76 cents yields a low 0.60%. Why am I selecting a stock that yields less than 1%?Potential capital appreciation, that’s why. Over the past 10 years, EA generated an annualized total return of 26.2%, more than double the U.S. market.As I write this on Oct. 25, Electronic Arts is days away from announcing its second quarter 2023 quarterly results. Analyst estimates suggest it will probably deliver lower revenues and earnings from Q2 2022.Not to worry, you’re buying EA stock to buy and hold forever.On Oct. 7, Electronic Arts launched its new EA app for Windows. It replaces Origin on PC, which started way back in  2011. The company listened to feedback from the gaming community before moving the replacement out of its beta phase.“The EA app is our fastest and lightest PC client to date,” the company stated in its blog post announcing the launch.Story continuesThe 30 analysts covering EA stock give it an overweight rating with a $153 target price.Pool Corporation (POOL)Yellow pool float, ring floating in a refreshing blue swimming poolSource: ShutterstockWith the  May 2022 dividend payment, Pool Corporation  (NASDAQ:POOL) raised its dividend by 25.0% to $1 a share.

The annual payment of 75 cents yields a reasonable 1.1%. I know what you’re thinking. You’re wondering why the maker of Jack Daniel’s and many other fine alcoholic beverages made the cut when it increased the dividend by less than 10%.A day later, on Dec. 29, 2021, it paid a  special dividend of $1 a share, making the total payout $1.1885 a share, 562% higher than the regular payment of $0.1795.I’m a big fan of special dividends. As far back as 2012, I’m on record endorsing the capital allocation practice. It’s an example of a shareholder-friendly company.In early October, Brown-Forman made a big announcement. It was buying Venezuela rum brand Diplomático. While no terms were revealed, the move makes the company a leader in the super-premium rum category.Diplomático’s top markets include the U.S. and Germany. It is sold in more than 100 countries worldwide. To date, Brown-Forman didn’t own a rum brand. This puts in a very upscale crowd.The  20 analysts covering BF-B stock give it a hold rating with a $73.06 target price.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp.

When the oil and gas producer announced the increase in February, it pointed out that it would continue to grow the quarterly dividend as its balance sheet strengthened. It is part of CEO Vicki Hollub’s plan to reward shareholders like Warren Buffett for sticking with it.OXY stock had a good year in the markets. It’s up more than 128% YTD. That puts it up for the past five years. It last traded this high in November 2018.Occidental reports Q3 2022 results on Nov. 9. It is expected to earn $2.50 a share in the third quarter.

YTD’s outflows were $44.6 billion, or just 3.6% of its assets under management.The  15 analysts covering TROW stock give it an underweight rating with a $95.50 target price.While the analysts don’t like it, it is still expected to earn $7.87 in 2022.

On a per-share basis, it earned 28 cents a share in the quarter, two cents better than the consensus estimate.Despite the negative view by investors about copper, the company has said that demand remains very strong. CEO Richard Adkerson stated in FCX’s Q3 2022 press release:“Despite near-term uncertainties, the long-term market fundamentals and value opportunities for our stakeholders remain highly attractive. I am confident that our strategy centered on being Foremost in Copper will be positive for all stakeholders as global conditions improve.”The  21 analysts covering FCX stock give it an overweight rating with a $35.98 target price.Down nearly 24% YTD, FCX remains well below its 52-week high of $51.99.Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold: Extra Space Storage (EXR)Extra Space Storage (EXR) facility exterior and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comExtra Space Storage  (NYSE:EXR) raised its dividend by 20.0% with the March 2022 payment to $1.50 a share.

43,68ec7bef-9bcb-3fa6-8a71-714c4f858015,BA,2022-10-30,The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 50% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-company-nyse-ba-largely-110041051.html,1667127641,STORY,['BA'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 50% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Boeing. Check out our latest analysis for Boeing ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Boeing?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Boeing. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Boeing's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Boeing. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 7.5%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.4% and 5.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of BoeingThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that The Boeing Company insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$60m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 43% stake in Boeing. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Boeing  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) we really liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Northrop Grumman:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$7.3b ÷ (US$43b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Northrop Grumman has an ROCE of 23%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 8.3%.

The broad-based decline of equities means that some of the best-run and most dominant companies in the U.S. have undervalued stocks to buy. These names are trading at a huge discount relative to their current and future earnings.The share prices of many highly profitable, market-leading companies have sunk by 50% or more during the current rout, in many cases erasing the gains that they achieved during the pandemic.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis presents a huge buying opportunity for investors looking to put capital to work in a weak market. And while we may not have achieved a bottom just yet, there are plenty of undervalued stocks to buy at fire-sale prices.These stocks should pay off handsomely once the market does bottom and share prices permanently reverse higher.Here are seven of the most undervalued stocks to buy now.GOOGAlphabet$89.40HDHome Depot$314AMDAdvanced Micro Devices$64.30BABoeing$194PFEPfizer$51.10JPMJPMOrgan Chase$135TGTTarget$151.50Undervalued Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)GOOG stock: letters spelling out googleSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.comAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock isn’t likely to be this affordable again for a very long time.Following the Google parent company’s most recent earnings report, GOOGL stock dropped 6% making it easily one of the best undervalued stocks to buy.YouTube’s ad revenue fell 2% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2022, while analysts, on average, were expecting an increase of 3%. Alphabet announced several cost-cutting measures, canceling the next generation of its Pixelbook laptop computer and announcing plans to close Stadia, its digital gaming service. The company also said that it is likely to reduce its workforce in the coming months.Story continuesThe added pressure on GOOGL stock following the Q3 earnings has dragged the shares down a total of 39% in the past 2 months. (A 20-for-1 stock split in July also lowered the share price). While discouraging, the decline makes Alphabet stock look very attractive at its current levels.The company’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio has dropped along with the share price to an attractive level of 17 times, which is below the large-cap technology stocks’ average of 25 times.This year’s pullback is one of the steepest in the company’s history. Investors should take advantage of this rare opportunity.Home Depot (HD)Home Depot (HD) sign backdropped by blue skySource: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.comDown 23% over the past year,  Home Depot (NYSE:HD) recently was at its lowest level since before Covid, making it one of the undervalued stocks to buy before a comeback.The decline of the retailer’s share price hardly seems justified, considering that the Atlanta-based company reported solid third-quarter earnings.Home Depot continues to manage inflationary pressures. The company has been focused on serving professional home builders and contractors rather than putting its efforts toward serving do-it-yourself renovators and weekend warriors.The company’s sales to professionals continue to exceed its revenue from do-it-yourself projects. The firm’s strong Q3 earnings show that Home Depot has been unfairly dragged lower by the market’s downturn.Add in a P/E ratio on HD stock of 19 and a quarterly dividend that yields 2.41%, and it’s easy to make the case that investors should buy HD stock on the dip.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been especially hard hit, down 57% in the last year, making it one of the undervalued stocks to buy on an anticipated chip turnaround.In mid-October, investors could purchase the shares of AMD for $55 each, around the same level at which the stock was trading in May 2020. While AMD doesn’t pay a dividend, the company’s earnings have continued to be stellar, and its outlook is strong despite its ongoing challenges caused by supply-chain issues and inflationary pressures.On Nov. 1, the company reported third-quarter results that fell short of Wall Street analysts’ average expectations. However, the company still posted revenue growth of nearly 30% for the July through September period.AMD’s latest earnings were also negatively impacted by charges stemming from its $49 billion acquisition of Xilinx in February 2022.  Xilinx makes specialty microchips called “field-programmable gate arrays.” Despite its short-term challenges and one-time charges, AMD remains a top semiconductor stock that investors should buy while it’s on sale.Boeing (BA)Boeing (BA) passenger airplane with open exit door, passenger windows, cargo door, close up view of Boeing logoSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock.comBoeing Company (NYSE:BA) stock was down for the count before last year’s market downturn.Several high-profile crashes of its aircraft in the last few years had created a crisis of confidence in the Virginia-based manufacturer of passenger airplanes. However, all indications are that Boeing has turned the page and is moving forward with more stringent safety guidelines.However, this fact hasn’t helped keep BA stock off the list of undervalued stocks to buy. The stock has fallen nearly 10% in the last 12 months.Investors willing to be patient with BA stock should consider the fact that Boeing is part of a duopoly when it comes to aircraft manufacturing. That’s because France’s Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) is the only other reputable company in the world that manufactures a high number of commercial passenger airplanes.This gives Boeing an enormous advantage and puts the company in a strong competitive position. While investors continue to fret about the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) looking over the shoulders of Boeing’s executives and engineers, they miss the fact that the company continues to win lucrative contracts around the world as airlines move to replace their aircraft fleets.Pfizer (PFE)Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is one of the world’s premier pharmaceutical companies, as well as one of the best undervalued stocks to buy right now. The company makes several blockbuster drugs.In late 2020, the company’s Covid-19 vaccine hit the market. Pfizer sold $36.7 billion worth of Covid-19 vaccines globally in 2021, representing 45% of its total revenue. In 2022, the company forecast Covid-19 vaccine sales of $54.5 billion, including booster shots.Despite the successful addition of its Covid-19 vaccine and the multi-billion dollars of revenue that it has brought in, PFE stock has declined 10% during the past year. The company’s price-earnings ratio is a modest 9.87, suggesting the stock is cheap at its current levels.Investors who snap up the shares will also benefit from a quarterly dividend that yields 3.20%. Meanwhile, Pfizer is continuing to develop its Covid-19 pill called “Paxlovid,”  and some analysts say the pill could be Pfizer’s next blockbuster medication if it gets approved by the FDA.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)A sign for JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM).Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.comJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is the biggest lender in America with nearly $4 trillion of assets under management, and the largest bank in the world with a market capitalization of $393 billion. It is also one of the better undervalued stocks to buy in the banking sector.JPMorgan Chase’s Q3 earnings did not disappoint investors. Its earnings serve as a bellwether for the banking industry, and the results bolstered sentiment among investors.While JPMorgan’s investment banking and equity trading units slowed in Q3, the bank offset those declines with greater income generated from higher interest rates charged on its loans, and also through a bump in its revenue from bond trading.JPM stock is currently down about 16% in the last year year. However, the bank’s share price has gained 26% in the past three months. The shares also currently have a low price-earnings ratio of 11.5 and pay a quarterly dividend that yields 2.9%.Undervalued Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Target (TGT)Image of the Target logo on a storefront.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comTarget (NYSE:TGT) stock has dropped 36% in the last year, making it one of the most undervalued stocks in retail.The shares of the big-box department store chain had been holding up fairly well until April. That’s when the company reported Q1 earnings that showed that inflation had affected its bottom line and that it had excessive inventory.While Target has made progress in unwinding its inventories, the company continues to struggle with a host of issues. In mid-November, Target reported a Q3 earnings miss, warned of soft holiday sales, and trimmed its Q4 guidance.As one might expect, the Q3 print didn’t go over well with analysts or investors. Target cited inflationary pressures that are forcing consumers to prioritize spending as the reason for the poor financial results and difficult outlook.

47,9f264495-8e02-3599-b813-1698844ad87b,VFC,2022-10-30,V.F (NYSE:VFC) Will Pay A Larger Dividend Than Last Year At $0.51,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/v-f-nyse-vfc-pay-120826358.html,1667131706,STORY,['VFC'],"[V.F. Corporation's (NYSE:VFC) periodic dividend will be increasing on the 20th of December to $0.51, with investors receiving 2.0% more than last year's $0.50. This takes the dividend yield to 7.1%, which shareholders will be pleased with.While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. V.F's stock price has reduced by 37% in the last 3 months, which is not ideal for investors and can explain a sharp increase in the dividend yield. View our latest analysis for V.F V.F's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Before this announcement, V.F was paying out 183% of what it was earning, and not generating any free cash flows either. Paying out such a large dividend compared to earnings while also not generating any free cash flow would definitely be difficult to keep up.According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 57%, which would make us comfortable with the dividend's sustainability, despite the levels currently being elevated.historic-dividendV.F Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.72 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 11% per annum over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.Dividend Growth Potential Is ShakySome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. Over the past five years, it looks as though V.F's EPS has declined at around 16% a year. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.Story continuesV.F's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. In the past the payments have been stable, but we think the company is paying out too much for this to continue for the long term. We don't think V.F is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. To that end, V.F has 4 warning signs (and 2 which are a bit unpleasant) we think you should know about.

50,1883932b-ec17-3776-af2d-fe368d577f7b,FOXA,2022-10-30,Investors in Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) have unfortunately lost 26% over the last year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-fox-nasdaq-foxa-unfortunately-123337955.html,1667046817,STORY,['FOXA'],"[The simplest way to benefit from a rising market is to buy an index fund. But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. Investors in Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 27%. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 21%. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 11% in that time. Furthermore, it's down 13% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders. But this could be related to the weak market, which is down 6.4% in the same period.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. Check out our latest analysis for Fox There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unhappily, Fox had to report a 41% decline in EPS over the last year. This fall in the EPS is significantly worse than the 27% the share price fall. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have expected earnings to drop faster.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Fox's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveThe last twelve months weren't great for Fox shares, which performed worse than the market, costing holders 26%, including dividends. The market shed around 21%, no doubt weighing on the stock price. Shareholders have lost 2.4% per year over the last three years, so the share price drop has become steeper, over the last year; a potential symptom of as yet unsolved challenges. Although Baron Rothschild famously said to ""buy when there's blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own"", he also focusses on high quality stocks with solid prospects. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Fox better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Fox that you should be aware of before investing here.Story continuesFox is not the only stock insiders are buying.

51,3bc6399a-3368-3456-a4ff-8e69bf349f26,PYPL,2022-10-30,"Is Weakness In PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) Stock A Sign That The Market Could be Wrong Given Its Strong Financial Prospects?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-paypal-holdings-inc-nasdaq-120228799.html,1667131348,STORY,['PYPL'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at PayPal Holdings' (NASDAQ:PYPL) recent performance, when its stock has declined 2.8% over the past month. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on PayPal Holdings'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PayPal Holdings is:10% = US$2.1b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.10 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.PayPal Holdings' Earnings Growth And 10% ROEAt first glance, PayPal Holdings seems to have a decent ROE. Even so, when compared with the average industry ROE of 16%, we aren't very excited. Although, we can see that PayPal Holdings saw a modest net income growth of 20% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. Bear in mind, the company does have a respectable level of ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is higher. So this also provides some context to the earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesWe then compared PayPal Holdings' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 14% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for PYPL? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is PayPal Holdings Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?PayPal Holdings doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that PayPal Holdings' performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that it has been reinvesting a high portion of its profits at a moderate rate of return, resulting in earnings expansion. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

52,cf49db9d-3645-3ba9-b1bf-4604aa4b5c03,PYPL,2022-10-30,15 Biggest Internet Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-internet-companies-world-191541244.html,1667070941,STORY,"['NOW', 'EQIX', 'ABNB', 'UBER', 'PDD', 'PYPL', 'JD', 'NFLX', 'BKNG']","[In this article, we will take a look at 15 of the biggest internet companies in the world. If you want to see more of the biggest internet companies in the world, go directly to 5 Biggest Internet Companies in the World.The internet has grown substantially over the past few decades.According to the IDC, there were only 16 million users of the internet at the end of 1995, representing around 0.4% of the world's population. Due to cheaper computers, rising incomes, and more utility online, however, the number of people who used the internet rose to 248 million at the end of 1999, representing 4.1% of the world's population.Although the internet bubble burst in 2000, the number of internet users continued to grow. With more organic growth, the number of internet users surpassed 1 billion in 2005 and 5 billion in 2020. As of July 2022, there are 5.473 billion internet users representing about 69% of the world's population according to Internet World Stats.With advancements in technology, there will likely be even more internet users in the future.One potential way to deliver more internet to the world are satellites. A leader in satellite internet Starlink describes its services, ""Starlink is the world's first and largest satellite constellation using a low Earth orbit to deliver broadband internet capable of supporting streaming, online gaming, video calls and more. Leveraging advanced satellites and user hardware coupled with our deep experience with both spacecraft and on-orbit operations, Starlink delivers high-speed, low-latency internet to users all over the world.""With Starlink, it's possible to attain high speed broadband from space. Starlink already has more than 2,000 satellites in space that collectively offer service in 32 nations. Starlink also benefits given that it's a division of SpaceX, which has substantial experience in launching rockets. Starlink adds, ""Starlink is ideally suited for areas of the globe where connectivity has typically been a challenge. Unbounded by traditional ground infrastructure, Starlink can deliver high-speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable or completely unavailable.""Story continuesAlthough Starlink is expensive for many places in the world given its current monthly cost and also the hardware costs for the satellite dish and router, the costs could decrease substantially in the future as more people use it. Other companies could also potentially decide to subsidize it or an alternative version of low orbit satellite internet to potentially gain more users.With more people on the internet, there's potential for bigger markets and more growth for internet companies. With more potential revenues, there's also potential for more profits.Given the growth of the internet in the past few decades, some internet companies have expanded substantially in scale and market capitalization. As a result, some of the largest internet companies are worth over $100 billion in market capitalization and two are worth over $1 trillion.20222022 has been a pretty challenging year for the markets given that the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates 5 times already. With inflation remaining high, many expect the U.S. central bank to increase rates further by the end of the year.Given the headwinds, many of the world's biggest internet companies have also been affected. With the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list, we took the top 15 companies by market capitalization from companiesmarketcap.com's Largest internet companies by market cap list.For our data, we used companiesmarketcap.com's data for market capitalization and we used the number of hedge funds in our database of 895 funds that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q2 2022 for number of hedge fund holders.15 Biggest Internet Companies in the World15.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think AES (NYSE:AES) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for AES:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.075 = US$2.3b ÷ (US$36b - US$6.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Thus, AES has an ROCE of 7.5%.  On its own that's a low return, but compared to the average of 3.1% generated by the Renewable Energy industry, it's much better. See our latest analysis for AES roceIn the above chart we have measured AES' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for AES.How Are Returns Trending?There hasn't been much to report for AES' returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at AES in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that AES has been paying out a decent 36% of its earnings to shareholders. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On AES' ROCEIn a nutshell, AES has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Yet to long term shareholders the stock has gifted them an incredible 194% return in the last five years, so the market appears to be rosy about its future. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.On a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for AES  that we think you should be aware of.While AES may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Ford said it would be taking a $2.7 billion non-cash, pretax impairment on its investment in Argo AI, with engineers and other employees being absorbed by Ford and its Argo AI partner, Volkswagen. Volkswagen said it would take a $1.9 billion charge from the winding down of Argo.Then Reuters reported that the Justice Department began a criminal probe last year looking into several crashes involving Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistance system, which was activated during those accidents, and whether Tesla made fraudulent claims about its driver assistance technology's capabilities.Argo AI and Tesla were both pursuing the goal of Level 4 and Level 5 driving automation — while using different strategies to get there. Argo AI worked with authorities and stakeholders like cyclist and pedestrian safety organizations to help shape its product, whereas Tesla made its users and even the open roads of the U.S. its beta testing playground.In any case, “it’s become clear it’s going to take longer than what investors really wanted to hear,"" Philip Koopman, Carnegie Mellon associate professor and self-driving expert, told Yahoo Finance.Autonomous driving level breakdown (source: SAE)Doug Field, Ford’s chief product and tech officer, said during the company’s earnings call this week that level 4 self-driving ""is going to be a really tough problem to solve."" Field, a former long-time Tesla engineer, added that the task will be ""the toughest problem of our generation.""Ford said its struggles with developing fully-autonomous Level 4 and Level 5 tech was both a capital and talent issue, meaning the automaker did not know how much capital and talent it would need to solve the problem. Ultimately, the cost was something that Ford and Volkswagen were unwilling to bear.“When we looked at the business opportunity here, we saw that the arc to a scaled, profitable business was a long way off — 5 years-plus out,” John Lawler, Ford CFO said to Yahoo Finance this week about Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous services. “[Ford technologists] believe there’s a lot of hurdles that need to be crossed.”Story continuesKoopman surmised that the industry is now focused on deployment models like middle-mile trucking — ie, autonomous trucking on highways only — as well as L2 and L3 assisted driving technology that Ford is now focusing on.“[Argo] was taking safety really seriously, this is a good thing,"" Koopman said. ""But for the industry overall, we’ve been seeing the industry shift away from robotaxis towards other deployment models.""A Ford Argo AI test vehicle, being tested, drives through the downtown area in Detroit, Michigan on July 12, 2019. (Photo credit should read JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP via Getty Images)Big valuations, bigger lossesAutomakers have spent close to $75 billion developing autonomous technology, though there is not much there to show for it yet.So what happened to an industry that UBS said would have a total addressable market worth close to $2.8 trillion by 2030?No one seemed to fully price in the challenges — from a technological, capital resources, and policy perspective — that would make the self-driving puzzle so hard to solve.Wall Street is now assessing that the promise of autonomous driving is too far off and is valuing the tech accordingly. Intel’s spin off and IPO of its Mobileye autonomous tech unit recently garnered a $16 billion valuation after being valued at $50 billion a year ago.At the same time, some companies are clear-eyed about the investment required.“[Self-driving startup] Waymo is not at the mercy of an OEM (original equipment manufacturer); Google [Waymo’s owner] can afford to make a 10-year bet, and the OEM’s just may not be comfortable with that kind of burn rate on that kind of timeframe, ” Koopman says. ”[GM-owned] Cruise is going to depend on how much patience GM has.”A Tesla Model 3 vehicle drives on autopilot along the 405 highway in Westminster, California, U.S., March 16, 2022. REUTERS/Mike BlakeAs for Tesla, CEO Elon Musk recently doubled down on his company's ability to solve the Level 4/Level5 problem.“You're going to have no one in the car by the end of this year,"" Musk said on the company's most recent earnings call. ""And certainly, without a question, that's whatever is in my mind next year,” he said. “I think we'll also have an update next year to be able to show to regulators that the [self-driving] car is safer, much so than the average human.”However, with regulators like the DOJ, SEC, and the NHTSA investigating dozens of crashes involving Tesla's self-driving software, there is some uncertainty as to when Tesla can fully launch its Level 4 / Level 5 platform.“Where’s the difference between puffery and fraud? I don’t know,” Koopman said, describing it as a legal question for lawyers and the DOJ.Legal issues aside, Koopman explained, there isn’t much in the way of what a regulator can do when a permit is requested for the deployment or live phase beyond approving the permit if the testing phase has gone smoothly. Once it’s live or in deployment, like Waymo and Cruise are in California, regulators can monitor performance for safety issues.“There is no regulatory hurdle to Tesla other than actually getting their technology to work,” Koopman said.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at Pinnacle West Capital (NYSE:PNW) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Pinnacle West Capital is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.042 = US$863m ÷ (US$23b - US$2.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Thus, Pinnacle West Capital has an ROCE of 4.2%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Electric Utilities industry average of 4.5%. Check out our latest analysis for Pinnacle West Capital roceIn the above chart we have measured Pinnacle West Capital's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Pinnacle West Capital.How Are Returns Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Pinnacle West Capital, we didn't gain much confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 6.3%, but since then they've fallen to 4.2%. However it looks like Pinnacle West Capital might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn summary, Pinnacle West Capital is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Unsurprisingly then, the total return to shareholders over the last five years has been flat. On the whole, we aren't too inspired by the underlying trends and we think there may be better chances of finding a multi-bagger elsewhere.Pinnacle West Capital does have some risks, we noticed   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is significant)  we think you should know about.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Target What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.47bUS$3.82bUS$5.02bUS$5.35bUS$5.53bUS$5.68bUS$5.83bUS$5.96bUS$6.10bUS$6.23bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.76%Est @ 2.53%Est @ 2.36%Est @ 2.25%Est @ 2.17% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.9% US$2.3kUS$3.4kUS$4.2kUS$4.3kUS$4.2kUS$4.0kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.6kUS$3.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$37bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (5.9%– 2.0%) = US$162bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$162b÷ ( 1 + 5.9%)10= US$92bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$129b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$168, the company appears quite undervalued at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Target as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.836. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Target, we've put together three important aspects you should explore:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 4 warning signs for Target we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does TGT's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

(NASDAQ:ADI) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/87-ownership-analog-devices-inc-120236311.html,1667131356,STORY,['ADI'],"[If you want to know who really controls Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 87% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Analog Devices. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Analog Devices?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Analog Devices does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Analog Devices' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Analog Devices is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.9%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.8% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 3.9% of the company stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 25 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Analog DevicesThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Analog Devices, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$252m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Analog Devices. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Analog Devices .If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA How Fast Is NVIDIA Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. NVIDIA's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 41%. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While NVIDIA did well to grow revenue over the last year, EBIT margins were dampened at the same time. So if EBIT margins can stabilize, this top-line growth should pay off for shareholders.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for NVIDIA's future profits.Story continuesAre NVIDIA Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of NVIDIA, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$14b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.Should You Add NVIDIA To Your Watchlist?NVIDIA's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering NVIDIA for a spot on your watchlist. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with NVIDIA , and understanding it should be part of your investment process.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. Investors in Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 27%. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 21%. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 11% in that time. Furthermore, it's down 13% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders. But this could be related to the weak market, which is down 6.4% in the same period.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. Check out our latest analysis for Fox There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unhappily, Fox had to report a 41% decline in EPS over the last year. This fall in the EPS is significantly worse than the 27% the share price fall. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have expected earnings to drop faster.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Fox's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveThe last twelve months weren't great for Fox shares, which performed worse than the market, costing holders 26%, including dividends. The market shed around 21%, no doubt weighing on the stock price. Shareholders have lost 2.4% per year over the last three years, so the share price drop has become steeper, over the last year; a potential symptom of as yet unsolved challenges. Although Baron Rothschild famously said to ""buy when there's blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own"", he also focusses on high quality stocks with solid prospects. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Fox better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Fox that you should be aware of before investing here.Story continuesFox is not the only stock insiders are buying.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.65bUS$8.88bUS$11.6bUS$14.6bUS$16.8bUS$18.7bUS$20.3bUS$21.6bUS$22.7bUS$23.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x1Est @ 15.15%Est @ 11.2%Est @ 8.43%Est @ 6.5%Est @ 5.14%Est @ 4.19% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$6.2kUS$7.7kUS$9.5kUS$11.1kUS$11.9kUS$12.4kUS$12.6kUS$12.5kUS$12.3kUS$11.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$108bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$24b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.0%) = US$473bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$473b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$238bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$346b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$106, the company appears quite good value at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walt Disney as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.091. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Selling at an average price of US$77.18, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive Colgate-Palmolive Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman, Noel Wallace, sold US$11m worth of shares at a price of US$77.18 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$74.64. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In the last year Colgate-Palmolive insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of Colgate-PalmoliveAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Colgate-Palmolive insiders own about US$63m worth of shares. That equates to 0.1% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Colgate-Palmolive Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Colgate-Palmolive shares in the last quarter. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by Colgate-Palmolive insiders. But it's good to see that insiders own shares in the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Colgate-Palmolive. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for Colgate-Palmolive that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course Colgate-Palmolive may not be the best stock to buy.

82,8d500f56-74f8-3fd4-ac5f-848b742ac5d9,JNPR,2022-10-30,Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) Is Paying Out A Dividend Of $0.21,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/juniper-networks-nyse-jnpr-paying-122513682.html,1667046313,STORY,['JNPR'],"[The board of Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 22nd of December, with investors receiving $0.21 per share. This means that the annual payment will be 2.7% of the current stock price, which is in line with the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Juniper Networks Juniper Networks' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Before making this announcement, Juniper Networks was earning enough to cover the dividend, but it wasn't generating any free cash flows. No cash flows could definitely make returning cash to shareholders difficult, or at least mean the balance sheet will come under pressure.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 62.0%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 45% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendJuniper Networks Is Still Building Its Track RecordJuniper Networks' dividend has been pretty stable for a little while now, but we will continue to be cautious until it has been demonstrated for a few more years. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $0.40 total annually to $0.84. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 9.7% over that duration. Investors will likely want to see a longer track record of growth before making decision to add this to their income portfolio.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. Over the past five years, it looks as though Juniper Networks' EPS has declined at around 5.0% a year. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern.Story continuesJuniper Networks' Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for Juniper Networks that investors need to be conscious of moving forward.

But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For example, the Aon plc (NYSE:AON) share price has soared 109% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. Meanwhile the share price is 3.2% higher than it was a week ago.Since the stock has added US$1.9b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. View our latest analysis for Aon While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Aon managed to grow its earnings per share at 35% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 16% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Aon's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Aon the TSR over the last 5 years was 118%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Aon returned a loss of 9.1% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 21%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 17% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Aon   (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.Aon is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

This positive momentum came despite menu prices increasing by 10% year-over-year.""McDonald's in the U.S. had positive traffic — not many restaurants today have positive traffic in the U.S.,"" Peter Saleh, managing director and restaurant analyst at BTIG, told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""Consumers are not necessarily pushing back on the higher prices, which are up about 10% year-over-year, despite all the inflation that we're seeing.""In September alone, McDonald's saw foot traffic increase by 6.2% year-over-year, according to Placer.ai's Bracha Arnold. That surpassed foot traffic across the wider quick service restaurant (QSR) category, which only saw an uptick of 0.8% during the same time period.McDonald's restaurant sign is seen in Streator, Illinois, United States, on October 15, 2022. (Photo by Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)On an earnings call with analysts Thursday, McDonald's executives emphasized that the company was still able to ""push through pricing"" despite challenges in the current macroeconomic environment, proving the ""strength of the brand proposition"" compared to its competitors.CEO Chris Kempczinski also noted that the restaurant industry continues to benefit from higher prices for food at home.In September, grocery prices increased by 13% while the price of food away from home went up 8.5%, per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. With a recession potentially underway, Saleh, who has Buy rating and $280 price target on McDonald's stock, noted that consumers will likely look for value when it comes to food purchases.""Bottom line is consumers still have to eat, so you're either eating at the grocery store or you're eating at restaurants,"" Saleh said. ""Grocery store pricing is up more so than restaurant pricing. At this point, restaurants are actually providing a little bit more value than they have historically.""Story continuesHowever, should key economic factors deteriorate, it may not be all golden for the food chain, Saleh warned.""If we go into a recession, where we start to lose jobs and unemployment goes up, that's when I think you'll see consumers start to push back,"" Saleh said.Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Although prices were relatively low, insiders chose to sell US$3.7m worth of stock in the past 12 months. This could be a sign of impending weakness.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for McDonald's McDonald's Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP &amp; CFO, Ian Borden, sold US$2.0m worth of shares at a price of US$256 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$275, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was 53% of Ian Borden's stake.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of McDonald's shares, than buying.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. McDonald's insiders own 0.09% of the company, currently worth about US$190m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At McDonald's Tell Us?The fact that there have been no McDonald's insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of McDonald's insider transactions don't fill us with confidence.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 5.4%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns.While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Seagate Technology Holdings' stock price has reduced by 36% in the last 3 months, which is not ideal for investors and can explain a sharp increase in the dividend yield. Check out our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings Seagate Technology Holdings' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Based on the last payment, Seagate Technology Holdings was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 11.5% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 46% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendSeagate Technology Holdings Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.00 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.80. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 11% per annum over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Seagate Technology Holdings has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 16% per annum. The company is paying a reasonable amount of earnings to shareholders, and is growing earnings at a decent rate so we think it could be a decent dividend stock.Story continuesWe Really Like Seagate Technology Holdings' DividendOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Seagate Technology Holdings might even raise payments in the future. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

The annual payment of 75 cents yields a reasonable 1.1%. I know what you’re thinking. You’re wondering why the maker of Jack Daniel’s and many other fine alcoholic beverages made the cut when it increased the dividend by less than 10%.A day later, on Dec. 29, 2021, it paid a  special dividend of $1 a share, making the total payout $1.1885 a share, 562% higher than the regular payment of $0.1795.I’m a big fan of special dividends.

It was buying Venezuela rum brand Diplomático. While no terms were revealed, the move makes the company a leader in the super-premium rum category.Diplomático’s top markets include the U.S. and Germany.

Selling at an average price of US$180, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best move for these insiders because their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for American Express American Express Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman &amp; CEO, Stephen Squeri, for US$8.6m worth of shares, at about US$178 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$150). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last year American Express insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does American Express Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that American Express insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$129m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The American Express Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of American Express, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with American Express and understanding it should be part of your investment process.Story continuesBut note: American Express may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on Occidental Petroleum's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:40% = US$11b ÷ US$28b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.40 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Occidental Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 40% ROETo begin with, Occidental Petroleum has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 27% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Needless to say, we are quite surprised to see that Occidental Petroleum's net income shrunk at a rate of 15% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesNext, when we compared with the industry, which has shrunk its earnings at a rate of 1.4% in the same period, we still found Occidental Petroleum's performance to be quite bleak, because the company has been shrinking its earnings faster than the industry.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is OXY fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Occidental Petroleum Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?When we piece together Occidental Petroleum's low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 2.6% (where it is retaining 97% of its profits), calculated for the last three-year period, we are puzzled by the lack of growth. The low payout should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings and consequently, should see some growth. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.Additionally, Occidental Petroleum has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 11% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 18% over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Occidental Petroleum certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. Moreover, after studying current analyst estimates, we discovered that the company's earnings are expected to continue to shrink in the future.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Thus, you can purchase Norfolk Southern's shares before the 3rd of November in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 21st of November.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.24 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$4.96 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Norfolk Southern stock has a trailing yield of around 2.2% on the current share price of $229.14. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. View our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Norfolk Southern paid out a comfortable 35% of its profit last year. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Norfolk Southern generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It distributed 43% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see Norfolk Southern's earnings per share have risen 19% per annum over the last five years. The company has managed to grow earnings at a rapid rate, while reinvesting most of the profits within the business. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Norfolk Southern has delivered 10% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.Final TakeawayIs Norfolk Southern worth buying for its dividend? Norfolk Southern has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. There's a lot to like about Norfolk Southern, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Norfolk Southern is facing. To help with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Norfolk Southern that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:INTU). The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Intuit’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Intuit What Is Intuit Worth?Good news, investors! Intuit is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $575.64, but it is currently trading at US$432 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Intuit’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Intuit?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 85% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Intuit. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since INTU is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on INTU for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy INTU. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

108,4620ad22-a6ba-3c14-927c-ee0ae2e6b601,VRSN,2022-10-30,Here's Why We Think VeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN) Is Well Worth Watching,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-think-verisign-nasdaq-132747919.html,1667050067,STORY,['VRSN'],"[It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like VeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for VeriSign How Fast Is VeriSign Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. VeriSign managed to grow EPS by 13% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. While we note VeriSign achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 6.8% to US$1.4b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of VeriSign's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are VeriSign Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of VeriSign, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$215m. This comes in at 1.0% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Story continuesIt's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like VeriSign, the median CEO pay is around US$13m.VeriSign offered total compensation worth US$10m to its CEO in the year to December 2021. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Is VeriSign Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for VeriSign is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for VeriSign, but the fun does not stop there. With company insiders aligning themselves considerably with the company's success and modest CEO compensation, there's no arguments that this is a stock worth looking into. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for VeriSign   (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

But over the last half decade, the stock has not performed well. You would have done a lot better buying an index fund, since the stock has dropped 51% in that half decade.On a more encouraging note the company has added US$5.7b to its market cap in just the last 7 days, so let's see if we can determine what's driven the five-year loss for shareholders. View our latest analysis for General Electric To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.General Electric became profitable within the last five years. However, it made a loss in the last twelve months, suggesting profit may be an unreliable metric at this stage. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.We don't think that the 0.4% is big factor in the share price, since it's quite small, as dividends go. It could be that the revenue decline of 10.0% per year is viewed as evidence that General Electric is shrinking. That could explain the weak share price.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. You can see what analysts are predicting for General Electric in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for General Electric the TSR over the last 5 years was -47%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that General Electric shareholders are down 25% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 21%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 8% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business.

Although prices were relatively low, insiders chose to sell US$3.7m worth of stock in the past 12 months. This could be a sign of impending weakness.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Progressive The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At ProgressiveOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President of Personal Lines, Patrick Callahan, for US$2.4m worth of shares, at about US$126 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$130. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was 59% of Patrick Callahan's stake.Progressive insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

Specifically, President of Personal Lines Patrick Callahan ditched US$2.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of ProgressiveMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Progressive insiders own about US$256m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The Progressive Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold Progressive shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Progressive.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 2.0%, which is fairly typical for the industry. See our latest analysis for LKQ LKQ's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. However, prior to this announcement, LKQ's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 5.1%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 22% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendLKQ Is Still Building Its Track RecordIt's not possible for us to make a backward looking judgement just based on a short payment history. This doesn't mean that the company can't pay a good dividend, but just that we want to wait until it can prove itself.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that LKQ has grown earnings per share at 22% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.LKQ Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that LKQ is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

(NYSE:EL) By 21%?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-est-e-lauder-140026363.html,1667052026,STORY,['EL'],"[Does the October share price for The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.47bUS$2.91bUS$3.58bUS$4.19bUS$4.60bUS$4.90bUS$5.16bUS$5.38bUS$5.57bUS$5.74bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x10Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.59%Est @ 5.21%Est @ 4.24%Est @ 3.56%Est @ 3.09% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$2.3kUS$2.5kUS$2.9kUS$3.2kUS$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$3.1kUS$3.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$30bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.7b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.0%) = US$122bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$122b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$63bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$93b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$206, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 21% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Estée Lauder Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.029. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

(NASDAQ:PEP) with 73% ownership",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-lot-riding-pepsico-130018073.html,1667134818,STORY,['PEP'],"[Every investor in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 73% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$251b in market cap. One-year return to shareholders is currently 16% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about PepsiCo. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PepsiCo?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that PepsiCo does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at PepsiCo's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in PepsiCo. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.8% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.3% of the company stock.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of PepsiCoWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of PepsiCo, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$390m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in PepsiCo. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with PepsiCo .If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

In good times, these stocks can provide multibagger returns. However, in times of market correction, these stocks cause maximum pain to the portfolio. It’s some low-beta blue-chip stocks that offer a sense of calmness and stability. These boring stocks for retirement provide regular cash flows and decent capital gains.Inflation has been stubborn, and it does not make sense to hold retirement funds in a savings account. The International Energy Agency chief believes that the world is in a “first truly global energy crisis.” In all probability, we are in an extended period of high inflation. One of the best strategies to maintain the purchasing power of money is to invest in high-yield stocks with robust fundamentals.Amidst several macroeconomic concerns, the good news is that the valuation of several stocks seems attractive. Exposure to undervalued boring stocks for retirement will ensure healthy dividends. At the same time, these stocks will trend higher from oversold levels. Total returns are likely to be robust.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s talk about three boring stocks for retirement.WMTWalmart$141.14LMTLockheed Martin$462.56PEPPepsiCo$179.07Walmart (WMT)Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWalmart (NYSE:WMT) stock has outperformed Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) for year-to-date 2022. The 1.6% dividend yield stock looks attractively valued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 23.8. Current valuations have already discounted the margin compression due to inflationary headwinds.I would hold a retail stock in the retirement portfolio, with consumer spending being a key GDP growth driver. In the coming years, sales growth is likely to remain steady. International expansion is expected to be a catalyst for potential sales acceleration.Story continuesWalmart reported comparable sales growth of 6.5% in the U.S. on a year-on-year basis. On a two-year stack basis, e-commerce sales have also increased by 18%. With a solid omnichannel presence, investment in store remodeling, and same-day delivery, the comparable store growth outlook seems optimistic.From a dividend perspective, Walmart reported an operating cash flow of $9.2 billion for the first half of 2022. Dividends are secure with an annualized cash flow potential of approximately $20 billion. Additional value creation will continue in the form of share repurchases.Lockheed Martin (LMT)A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWith strong quarterly results, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock has trended higher by 12% since last month. LMT stock, however, remains attractively valued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 18.0. Additionally, a dividend yield of 2.6% is robust.For Q2 2022, Lockheed reported net sales of $16.6 billion. For the same period, free cash flow was $2.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion in Q3 2021. An important point to note is that Lockheed closed Q3 2022 with an order backlog of $140 billion. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the backlog increased by $5 billion.Considering the global geopolitical scenario, it seems likely that the company’s backlog will continue to swell. This sets the stage for higher cash flows and sustained growth in dividends.Lockheed has also been investing in next-generation technology to accelerate growth. These technologies include hypersonics, directed energy, and autonomy, among others. By staying ahead of the curve, Lockheed will continue to create value.PepsiCo (PEP)Logotype of PepsiCo (PEP) against the blue skySource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.comPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) stock has traded sideways throughout the year. The 2.6% dividend yield stock is attractive, with the company reporting substantial numbers for Q3 2022.With PEP stock in an extended period of consolidation, a breakout on the upside seems imminent. For year-to-date 2022, Pepsi has reported net revenue growth of 7.7%. Further, the company has raised its full-year organic revenue growth guidance to 12% (earlier 10%).It’s worth noting that PepsiCo derived 76% of revenue for the first nine months of 2022 from North America and Europe. With PepsiCo building a strong presence in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, among other emerging economies, there is ample headroom for robust revenue growth.The company has also been aggressive in terms of packaging and flavor innovation. This is another factor that will continue to boost growth. Therefore, PepsiCo is a core portfolio stock with visibility in earnings and dividend growth.For 2022, PepsiCo has guided $7.7 billion in shareholder returns. A bulk of this is in the form of dividends. With dividend growth at a CAGR of 7.8% in the last ten years, the outlook for value creation is positive.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is:27% = US$5.7b ÷ US$21b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.27 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 27% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 23% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 38% net income growth seen by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals over the past five years isn't overly surprising.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 21%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is REGN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Regeneron Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

120,530865dd-79b6-39dc-a246-260e3c2691e0,AMP,2022-10-30,"Is It Smart To Buy Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smart-buy-ameriprise-financial-inc-120558797.html,1667131558,STORY,['AMP'],"[It looks like Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase Ameriprise Financial's shares before the 4th of November in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 18th of November.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.25 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$5.00 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Ameriprise Financial stock has a trailing yield of around 1.6% on the current share price of $312.17. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Ameriprise Financial has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Ameriprise Financial is paying out just 19% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see Ameriprise Financial has grown its earnings rapidly, up 26% a year for the past five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, Ameriprise Financial has increased its dividend at approximately 16% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Ameriprise Financial for the upcoming dividend? Companies like Ameriprise Financial that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings, are usually reinvesting heavily in their business. This strategy can add significant value to shareholders over the long term - as long as it's done without issuing too many new shares. Ameriprise Financial ticks a lot of boxes for us from a dividend perspective, and we think these characteristics should mark the company as deserving of further attention.So while Ameriprise Financial looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Our analysis shows 1 warning sign for Ameriprise Financial and you should be aware of it before buying any shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.
