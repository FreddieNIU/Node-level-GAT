O'Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our second quarter financial results. Relative to the significant volatility experienced by investors in the first quarter, market conditions in 2Q were more subdued and global financial market performance is varied. Global equities generated positive returns for the third consecutive quarter as investors saw continued strength in developed equity markets, but weakness in emerging markets. Fixed income market sell as investors had to contend was still elevated levels of inflation and further central bank rate hikes, including the Federal Reserve raising interest rates above 5% for the first time since 2007. The second quarter was also characterized by falling currency market volatility, which created headwinds for our foreign exchange business.Turning to slide three of our investor presentation, I will review our second quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance, second quarter ROE was 13% and pre-tax margin expanded by 1.2 percentage points year-over-year to 29.5%. Relative to the year-ago period, 2Q EPS increased by 14% to $2.17 supported by our common share repurchases, significantly higher NII, strong front office software and data revenue growth and an increase in securities finance revenue. Our results also benefited from the release of an allowance related to the support of a financial -- US financial institution as well as an accounting adoption. Taken together, these factors more than offset headwinds in some of our other fee-based businesses and the impact of higher-than-desired year-over-year expense growth.Turning to our business momentum, in Q1, I highlighted that by strengthening our implementation capabilities, we have a line of sight into a meaningful amount of client onboarding this year. We began to realize the benefits of this plan and onboarded $1.2 trillion of AUC/A during the second quarter, primarily driven by State Street Alpha, underscoring the power of the Alpha value proposition to our investment services strategy and long-term growth. As a result, our AUC/A installation backlog declined to $2.4 trillion, while total AUC/A increased by 5% quarter-over-quarter to $39.6 trillion, both at quarter-end in part as a result of this new business. We also recorded over $140 billion of asset servicing wins in the second quarter, largely driven by strong sales in the desirable asset owner, official institutions and alternatives client segments.Our sales pipeline grew and we expect substantial on-boardings in the coming quarters. We continue to advance and broaden our enterprise outsource solutions strategy across our clients' front, middle and back-office activities, as demonstrated by the expansion of Alpha's capabilities to ETFs, which we announced in 2Q. For the past 30 years, State Street has continuously innovated to support what has become a $10 trillion ETF market. Today, State Street is the largest ETF administrator in the world with more than 2,700 ETF serviced in 13 countries. That long cycle of innovation continues as State Street Alpha now supports the entire ETF lifecycle. By integrating CRD's front office products with State Street's industry-leading ETF servicing capabilities, Alpha now provides a centralized platform for ETFs issuers across the entire ETF lifecycle, including portfolio management, trading and compliance to enable the growth across a variety of ETF strategies and increased speed-to-market.Turning to front office software and data business, our overall CRD pipeline is strong. In the second quarter, we converted a meaningful number of on-prem CRD clients to recurring SaaS revenue, which when coupled with new SaaS client implementations, increased annual recurring revenue by 12% relative to the year-ago period. In addition, Charles River Wealth Management Solution continues to resonate with clients and drove a significant increase in on-prem revenues this quarter. Year-to-date, CRD's wealth-driven revenue has more than doubled as compared to the first half of 2022 and we remain on track to grow CRD's wealth revenue this year. The State Street Global Advisors quarter-end assets under management totaled $3.8 trillion, supported by higher period-end market levels and $38 billion of net inflows from all three business lines, ETF, cash and institutional.Our SPDR ETF business gathered $27 billion of net inflows in the second quarter, including $20 billion of net inflows into SPY, the industry's largest ETF. We also delivered a solid performance in our US low-cost ETF segment, which gathered $7 billion of net inflows in the quarter, continuing to gain market share. Our cash business gathered a solid $10 billion of net inflows in the second quarter, as our US government money market funds benefited from the attractiveness of the cash asset class in the higher-rate environment. Turning to our financial condition, State Street's balance sheet, liquidity and capital positions remain strong. Our CET1 ratio was a strong 11.8% at quarter-end, well above our regulatory minimum. The ongoing capital generation of our business, coupled with effective balance sheet management and our strong capital position has enabled us to deliver against our goal of returning significant capital to our shareholders.In 2Q, we returned approximately $1.3 billion of capital, buying back more than $1 billion of our common shares and declaring over $200 million of common stock dividends. This means that cumulatively over the last three quarters to the end of June, we have returned approximately $4.4 billion of capital to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends. The strength of our balance sheet was also highlighted with the release of the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR stress test results in June, following which, we announced our intention for the third year in a row to increase State Street's common stock dividend by 10% in the third quarter, subject to consideration and approval by our Board of Directors. It remains our intention to continue common share repurchases under our existing authorization for up to $4.5 billion in 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors.To conclude, financial market conditions in the second quarter were mixed. Although global equities recorded another sequential quarter of growth, there was weakness in emerging markets and we witnessed the negative impact of persistent inflation and further central bank rate hikes on fixed-income markets. Meanwhile, both equity and currency volatility continued to decline. Despite this varied backdrop, we achieved a number of positive outcomes in the second quarter, including meaningfully reducing our asset servicing backlog, further developing our Alpha capabilities, continuing to record new asset servicing wins, driving strong growth in front office software and data revenue and gathering solid net inflows at Global Advisors. And while we reached double-digit year-over-year EPS growth supported by our capital management and the higher interest-rate environment, our results were below our potential.First, while we achieved sequential fee revenue growth in areas of our business this quarter, we need to demonstrate the fee growth every quarter especially as NII. We need to demonstrate that fee growth every quarter especially as NII is no longer a tailwind. And second, we are highly focused on controlling our expense base. We have a well-established track record of reengineering our processes and transforming our operations in order to improve our efficiency and realized productivity growth. We plan to utilize additional tactical expense levers at our disposal in addition to our ongoing structural productivity efforts in order to support our financial performance for the benefit of our shareholders. Now let me hand the call over to Eric who'll take you through the quarter in more detail.Copyright: kritchanut / 123RF Stock PhotoEric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our second quarter results on slide four. We reported EPS of $2.17 for the quarter, an increase of 14% relative to the second quarter a year ago. As you can see on the left panel of this slide, revenue grew by 5% year-on-year, driven by the expansion in our front-office solutions area, where we are an industry leader, continued momentum in securities finance business as well as strong growth in net interest income. This growth enabled us to offset some of the headwinds we saw in other fee areas given the relatively mixed macroeconomic backdrop. We also had the benefit of an accounting change for tax credit investments, which simplifies our reporting going forward.While our overall year-on-year fee growth was less than we would have liked to deliver, we did see sequential quarter revenue momentum and a step up in the sales pipeline, which we expect to build upon in the coming quarters and which I'll discuss later in today's presentation. As we drive growth, we continue to prudently invest in the business while remaining focused on managing costs given the current operating environment, and we stand ready to further intervene on expenses should the softness in the global environment persists. Turning now to slide five. We saw period-end AUC/A increased by 4% on a year-on-year basis and 5% sequentially. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period-end equity market levels and client net inflows.Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased as a result of the significant trillion-dollar Alpha installation and higher period-end market levels. At Global Advisors, we saw similar positive dynamics play out in the quarter. Period-end AUM increased 9% year-on-year and 5% sequentially. The year-on-year increase in AUM was largely driven by higher period-end market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, the increase in AUM was also due to higher period-end market levels as well as strong sequential net inflows. Turning to slide six. On the left side of the page, you'll see second quarter total servicing fees down 3% year-on-year as net-new business in the quarter was more than offset by lower client activities and adjustments largely due to lower custody and transaction volume and better than usual pricing headwinds.Positive year-on-year equity markets were offset by the negative impact of fixed-income markets. Sequentially, total servicing fees were up 3% primarily as a result of higher average market levels and net-new business slightly offset by better-than-usual pricing headwinds this quarter. We had a more constructive market environment relative to the first quarter as well as a significant onboarding of $1.2 trillion of AUC/A related to an Alpha client in the asset manager client segment, which comes at a modest fee rate, but with services are expected to be added in the coming years. Within servicing fees, back-office servicing fees were generally consistent with total servicing fees and largely driven by the factors I just described. Middle office services fees performance was meaningfully more positive for the quarter.On a year-on-year basis, fees were up 3% primarily reflecting net-new business and up 10% sequentially, largely driven by the installation that I just mentioned. On the bottom panel of this page, we've again included some sales performance indicators which highlight the business momentum we saw in the quarter. While total AUC/A wins in the second quarter were not as robust in volume terms, client engagement remained healthy and we saw wins across strategic segments, including mandates and asset owners, official institutions and alternatives, which are key growth areas for us as we previously mentioned. The wins including those in the alternatives segment, which are more complex to service come with above-average fee rates. We have also seen a healthy uptick in our pipeline this quarter.Turning to slide seven. Second quarter management fees were $461 million, down 6% year-on-year, primarily reflecting the impact of net outflows from prior periods, a shift of certain management fees into NII as previously described and some pricing headwinds, partially offset by higher average market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were up 1% as a result of higher market levels and cash net inflows. As you can see on the bottom-right of the slide, our investment management franchise remains well-positioned with very strong and broad-based business momentum across each of our three lines of business. In ETFs, we saw very strong net inflows of $27 billion into SPY and our sector suite of ETFs as well as our SPDR portfolio low-cost suite.In our institutional business, we saw net inflows with continued momentum in our well-established index fixed-income and defined contribution franchises. Across our cash franchise, we continue to see strong demand for our money market funds. We recorded net inflows of $10 billion. Turning to slide eight. Relative to the period a year ago, second quarter FX trading services revenue was down 8% year-on-year and 11% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower client FX volumes and lower industry FX volatility. Relative to the period a year-ago, both volumes and volatility were more muted as the start of the war in Europe last year caused unusually high FX trading activity in the first half of 2022. Many clients were also risk-off during the debt ceiling discussions in April and May, with a rebound in June and client volumes falling its resolution.Altogether 2Q is muted. We are optimistic about 3Q, but it's hard to predict. Securities finance performed well in the second quarter with revenues up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher agency spreads. Sequentially, revenues were up 7%, again mainly driven by higher agency spreads as well as higher prime services or enhanced custody revenues from deeper client engagement and specials activity, partially offset by lower balances. Moving on to software and processing fees. Second quarter software and processing fees were up 18% year-on-year and 34% sequentially, primarily driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD which I will turn to shortly. Lending fees for the quarter were down 5% year-on-year, primarily due to changes in product mix, but up 5% sequentially, mainly driven by strong client demand for lines of credit.Finally, other fee revenue increased $101 million year-on-year, primarily due to a tax credit investment accounting change and the absence of negative market-related adjustments. This includes the impact of the new accounting adoption. Moving to slide nine, you'll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue increased 29% year-on-year, primarily as a result of higher on-premise renewals and continued growth in our more durable software-enabled and professional services revenue as we continue to convert and implant more clients over to our SaaS environment. About 60% of our clients are now on our SaaS platform. Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was up nearly 50%. About two-thirds of this uptick was driven by wealth management mandates that are becoming an increasingly important growth segment for us.Our sales pipeline continues to grow and remains strong for our Charles River development front office solutions products. Turning to some of the other Alpha business metrics on the right panel, we were pleased, we had three more Alpha mandates go live, which brings our total live Alpha clients to 15, and as I previously mentioned, we installed a significant portion of assets related to Alpha this quarter. We expect to provide more services related to these assets in the future, helping us increase the share of our client's wallet. Now turning to slide 10. Second quarter NII increased 18% year-on-year, but declined 10% sequentially to $691 million. The year-on-year increase was largely due to higher short-term rates and increase in long-term rates and proactive balance sheet positioning, partially offset by lower average deposits.Sequentially, the decline in NII performance was primarily driven by our continued rotation of non-interest-bearing deposit balances and rate pressure in the US back-book, partially offset by higher short-term market rates from international central bank hikes. On the right side of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the second quarter. Average deposits declined 2% quarter-on-quarter in line with industry total deposit trends, which also fell by 2% in the second quarter and reflect client preferences to shift some cash to other products during periods of rising rates. Our operational deposits as a percentage of total deposits remained consistent at approximately 75%. Our global floating-rate loan book provides upside at this stage in the cycle and our investment portfolio positioning provides a tailwind as long rates roll through.We now also have the opportunity to selectively add some duration across the curve, as we see good entry points, which could enhance NII over time. Sequentially, US dollar client deposit betas were 100% during the second quarter, leading again to some sequential NII compression. We are now at the point in the US rate cycle where we expect to adjust back-book pricing to accommodate our larger clients, but do so in a disciplined manner and usually as part of a broader relationship discussion, a balancing trade for fee opportunities. Foreign currency deposit betas for the quarter continued to be much lower in the 45% to 50% range. We've also included a new slide in the appendix, page 16 that shows our NII trends over the past few rate cycles. I think it will be -- it will put the larger NII increases and decreases in context, which are driven by many factors, including changes in interest rates, the pacing of hikes, deposit levels and mix, Fed balance sheet changes as well as equity markets.You can see from that page that our recent quarters have come with a much higher than usual level of NII and we are now normalizing to a more typical level of NII that is inherent in our business activities. Turning to slide 11. Second quarter expenses excluding notable items increased 6% year-on-year. Sequentially, excluding seasonal expenses, second quarter expenses increased just over 1% as we actively manage the expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts, all while carefully investing in strategic elements of the company, including Alpha, private markets, technology and operations, automation. On a line-by-line basis year-on-year, compensation employee benefits increased 7%, primarily driven by salary increases associated with wage inflation and higher headcount attributable primarily to operational staff for growth areas, technology staff, insourcing and some lower attrition, lower than expected attrition rate.Sequentially, however, we have managed the headcount to be flat. Information systems and communications expenses increased 3%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by benefits from ongoing optimization efforts in sourcing and credits related to vendor savings initiative. Transaction processing decreased 2%, mainly reflecting lower sub-custody costs from vendor credits. Occupancy increased 7% as we relocated our headquarters building temporarily resulting in overlapping costs and other expenses were up 7%, mainly reflecting higher professional fees. Moving to slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide.As you can see, we continue to navigate our operating environment with very strong capital levels, which remained well above both our internal targets and the regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.8% was down 30 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the continuation of our share repurchases and modestly higher RWA, partially offset by retained earnings. Our LCR for State Street Corporation was flat quarter-on-quarter at 108% and decreased four percentage points quarter-on-quarter, but still quite high at 120% for State Street Bank and Trust. We're also very happy with our performance on this year's CCAR with the calculated stress capital buffer well above the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a continued preliminary SCB at the floor.This demonstrates we have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. In keeping with our results, in June, we announced the planned 10% increase for our 3Q '23 quarterly common stock dividend, subject to Board approval and it remains our intention to continue common share repurchases under our current authorization of up to a total of $4.5 billion in 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors. We plan another $1 billion buyback in third quarter. Lastly, we are quite pleased to return roughly $1.3 billion to shareholders in the second quarter '23, consisting of just over $1 billion of common share repurchases and over $200 million in common stock dividends. Turning to slide 13, which provides the summary of our second quarter results.While there is certainly still work to do, we are pleased with the durability of our business this quarter against a mixed and divergent backdrop. Robust expansion of our front office solutions area and continued momentum in securities finance as well as strong growth in net interest income enables us to offset some of the headwinds we saw in the other fee areas highlighting the resiliency of the franchise. Next I'd like to provide our current thinking regarding our third quarter. At a macro-level, while we know that rate expectations have been moving, our rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggest that the Fed, the ECB and the BOE will all continue to hike in 3Q to varying degrees. In terms of average equity markets, we currently expect US equity markets to be up about 5% quarter-on-quarter as we are expecting equity markets to remain flat from now to quarter-end, and we expect international equity markets to be flattish on average.Regarding fee revenue in 3Q, on a sequential-quarter basis, we expect overall fee revenue to be down approximately 1% to 1.5%, with servicing fees down 1% to 2% as the below-average fee repricing headwinds we saw this past quarter is expected to normalize in 3Q. This will also include a revenue headwind from the previously disclosed client exit. We expect management fees to be up around 0.5% to 1.5%. We expect front office software and data quarter-on-quarter to be down 7%, as we do not expect the level of on-premise renewals in 3Q that we saw this quarter. We expect the other fee revenue line to come in around $30 million to $35 million in 3Q which is higher than prior years but down post the accounting change impact in 2Q. Regarding NII, after three double-digit sequential increases in NII last year, we now expect NII to decrease 12% to 18% on a sequential-quarter basis, driven by lower deposit levels and continued rotation as rate hikes continue into 3Q.Our outlook assumes that average non-interest-bearing deposits declined by approximately $5 billion from 2Q to 3Q. As we look forward to 4Q, we do expect to see some moderation to the amount of deposit rotation as we work through most of our back-book and most central banks begin to pause. With that context, we expect that 4Q NII decline to be much less somewhere in the range of down 2% to 6% versus 3Q, and we expect NII to then stabilize around those levels, but it will depend on market conditions. And our expectation is that 4Q declines in non-interest-bearing deposits will be small as well likely in the down to a $3 billion range versus 3Q. Turning to expenses, we remain focused on controlling costs in this environment, and we expect to take action in 3Q to bend the cost curve.As such, we expect that expenses will be down 0.5% to 1% on a sequential-quarter basis and intend to continue to actively manage expenses. As always, this is on an ex-notables basis and we're keeping an eye on the FDIC assessment, which could be a 3Q notable item. And as I noted previously, given the accounting changes we adopted this quarter, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 21% and 22% for third quarter. With that let me hand the call back to Ron.Ronald P. O'Hanley: Thanks, Eric.

Michael Hansen: Thank you, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal '23 fourth quarter revenue was $2.28 billion compared to $2.07 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 10.3%. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.77 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 9.1%. As we've done in the past, I will share revenue mix of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment for the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, there can be small fluctuations in mix between quarters. Uniform Rental was 48%, dust [ph] was 18%, hygiene was 16%, shop towels were 4%, linen, which includes microfiber wipes, towels and aprons was 10%, and catalog revenue was 4%.These percentages are consistent with last year, which speaks to the robust demand across all of our products and services. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter was $249.8 million compared to $218.2 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 14.1%. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $261.5 million compared to $226.2 million last year. The fire business revenue was $173.5 million, and the organic revenue growth rate was 17.3% resulting in a strong finish to the year. The Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was $88 million, and the organic growth rate was 11.5%. This strong performance exceeded our expectations as robust demand continued for these products and services.Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.09 billion, compared to $946.2 million last year, an increase of 15.1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 compared to 45.6% last year, an increase of 210 basis points. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a tailwind, decreasing 65 basis points from last year. Strong volume growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services help generate great operating leverage. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.7% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 51% for First Aid and Safety Services, 47.9% for Fire Protection Services and 36% for Uniform Direct sale.Fourth quarter SG&amp;A was 27.1%, which was up 100 basis points from last year. We've continued to invest in selling resources and branding initiatives, and our insurance costs were higher. We are self-insured, which means our insurance costs can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Fourth quarter operating income was $470.8 million compared to $404.4 million last year. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 20.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 compared to 19.5% in last year's fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.4% compared to 22.8% last year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $346.2 million compared to $294.5 million last year. This year's fourth quarter diluted EPS was $3.33 compared to $2.81 last year.I'll now turn the call back over to Todd to provide his thoughts and our financial expectations for fiscal '24.Pixabay/Public DomainTodd Schneider: Thank you, Mike. As we move into fiscal '24, we will celebrate our 40th anniversary of being a publicly traded company. Back then, we were excited about what laid ahead. Today, we are equally excited about the significant opportunities that the future holds. Our value proposition remains strong, and our prospects for continued profitable growth are great. Every business goods producing or services providing has a need for image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. We work with businesses to help them build a better workday. We provide the products and perform the services better, faster and more economically freeing businesses to concentrate on their core competency. A year ago, I introduced three priorities: branding, ESG and technology to help drive our focus, continue to differentiate us in the marketplace and provide increased competitive advantages.I'm pleased with our progress in each of these key areas. Our branding efforts continue as more and more businesses have learned how we can help them get ready for the workday. We continue to make progress on our ESG goals and our sustainable solutions focus on reducing, reusing, recycling and repurposing our textiles. These solutions continue to resonate with our customers and prospects as we help them achieve their sustainability initiatives. I want to spend a minute speaking about technology, in particular, our digital transformation journey. We've been very successful thus far in using technology to drive efficiencies in our production facilities, efficiencies out on the routes with our trucks via our proprietary Smart Truck technology, and we are in the early innings of our My Cintas customer portal, which makes it easier for our customers to do business with us.As we look to the future, we're very excited to have great technology partners in SAP and Verizon, which are helping us to provide a better customer experience and improve efficiencies within our business. We are excited to announce today that we have an additional strategic technology partner with Google, leveraging their Google Cloud platform. As a result of these relationships, it positions us at the forefront of technology innovation. We are still in the very early stages of our digital transformation journey, and we are excited about the impact it will have on our customers and our company in total. We are confident technology will be a competitive advantage for us now and well into the future. I will now provide our guidance for fiscal '24.Our fiscal year '24 -- for our fiscal year '24, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $9.35 billion to $9.5 billion, a total growth rate of 6.1% to 7.8%. We expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $13.85 to $14.35, a growth rate of 6.6% to 10.5%. Please note the following: fiscal year '24 interest expense is expected to be approximately $98 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal year '23, predominantly as a result of lower variable rate debt. This may change as a result of future share buybacks or acquisition activity. Our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3% compared to a rate of 20.4% for fiscal '23. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '24 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points.Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or significant economic disruptions or downturns. And guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. We're excited about next year and beyond. The future of Cintas remains bright. I'll turn the call back over to Jared.Jared Mattingley: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts.

(NYSE:OMC) Maintain Its Strong Returns?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/omnicom-group-inc-nyse-omc-131424132.html,1689426864,STORY,['OMC'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Omnicom Group How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Omnicom Group is:36% = US$1.5b ÷ US$4.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.36 in profit.Does Omnicom Group Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Omnicom Group has a better ROE than the average (12%) in the Media industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Omnicom Group by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesOmnicom Group's Debt And Its 36% ROEOmnicom Group clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.41. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

The agency, Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), on Tuesday paused its legal proceedings to block the acquisition in favor of renewed negotiations with Microsoft. Microsoft has agreed to pay Activision a $3 billion break up fee in the event the tie-up failed to close by that date.""We appreciate the Ninth Circuit's swift response denying the FTC's motion to further delay the Activision deal,"" Microsoft president and vice-chair Brad Smith wrote on Twitter. ""This brings us another step closer to the finish line in this marathon of global regulatory reviews.""We appreciate the Ninth Circuit's swift response denying the FTC's motion to further delay the Activision deal. This brings us another step closer to the finish line in this marathon of global regulatory reviews.— Brad Smith (@BradSmi) July 15, 2023Legal experts view the ruling as a win for Microsoft, even though the FTC's underlying lawsuit alleging the deal would harm competition remains pending.They reason that Microsoft's costs to keep the deal afloat while awaiting the outcome of the FTC's lawsuit would reach a tipping point, given that the agency is under no deadline to resolve its case.The FTC first filed a challenge to block the merger in December. Its lawsuit, brought in the agency’s in-house court, alleges that combining the two companies would suppress competition in three markets: gaming consoles, subscription content, and cloud-gaming.Story continuesThe acquisition, if closed, would be the largest in Microsoft’s history and the largest in the gaming industry.Microsoft, which owns gaming console Xbox, controlled 16% of the console market in 2021. Microsoft said in court documents that since 2021 its share of console sales rose to 21%, though it has remained in third place behind PlayStation (SONY) and Nintendo (NTDOY).Key to the Microsoft-Activision deal is the ""Call of Duty"" video game franchise.. (AP Foto/Peter Morgan, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The key to tie up is Activision Blizzard's lucrative ""Call of Duty"" franchise. The game series earns Activision Blizzard billions each year, with the latest installment, 2022's ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II,"" clearing $1 billion in sales in its first 10 days on the market.Adding the Call of Duty and Activision's other game franchises to Microsoft’s existing first-party titles including “Halo” and “Forza” would catapult Microsoft past Nintendo (NTDOY) to make the company the second-largest home console maker by revenue behind Sony (SONY). It would also put Microsoft behind Tencent and Sony as the third-largest gaming company by global revenue.Global regulators including those in the EU, Brazil, China, Japan, and South Korea have already approved the deal.The UK's CMA has voiced concerns that the deal could make Microsoft so dominant in cloud gaming, that it could lead to “reduced innovation and less choice for UK gamers over the years to come.""To assuage regulators' concerns that Microsoft would abuse the deal to wall off its leading ""Call of Duty"" game from its rivals, the company has signed agreements with Switch console owner, Nintendo, and Nvidia promising to keep the game available on the competing platforms for at least 10 years.The FTC did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment on the appellate court decision.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Not only are the companies typically successful, profitable enterprises, but they usually have a long history of surviving various market cycles. Dividend stocks also handily outperform their non-income-generating brethren over time. In 2013, J.P. Morgan Asset Management published a paper that explored this superiority. It found that companies initiating dividends and then raising the payouts over the 40-year period between 1972 and 2012 provided far superior returns for investors. Dividend stocks averaged 9.5% annually compared to just 1.6% for non-dividend-paying stocks.Considering this dominance, it shouldn’t be a surprise that income stocks are usually contained in the portfolios of the most successful investors. The following three companies could be the best $1,000 dividend stock investments to make today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsJohnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Why Johnson &amp; Johnson Stock is Clearly Set to Rise AgainSource: ShutterstockHealthcare leader Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) should be at the top of every dividend investor’s list of stocks to buy right now. It produces high-margin pharmaceuticals and is focused on finding the next big drug.Arguably better known for its portfolio of consumer health products, including Band-Aid bandages, Tylenol pain reliever, and Listerine mouthwash, which was the smallest component of the company, and Johnson &amp; Johnson just spun off its consumer health products business. Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) is now a standalone company though the pharma giant still owns 91% of the business.Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of the best dividend stocks to buy because people cannot go without their medications. The pharma’s treatment for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, Stelara, generated $9.7 billion in sales last year. Remicade, a therapy for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, generated $2.3 billion in sales. In all, it had $52.6 billion in pharmaceutical sales last year.Story continuesJohnson &amp; Johnson also offers a variety of medical devices and healthcare services and products.It has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1944. The shareholder payout has increased for 60 consecutive years and currently yields 2.9% annually.Sysco (SYY)A photo of various food packaging containers.Source: Pixel-Shot / Shutterstock.comFood distribution leader Sysco (NYSE:SYY) is also where to invest in dividend stocks this month. It might not be as well known as the pharmaceutical giant, but it is the leader in its industry. Sysco has a 17% share of the highly fragmented food distribution market. U.S. Foods (NYSE:USFD) is second with an 11% share.Sysco operates 333 distribution facilities globally and serves approximately 700,000 customer locations. It generated $68.6 billion in sales in 2022. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, revenue is up 11.7%. It generated the highest amount of operating income in the company’s history as net earnings surged 42% year over year.The food distributor is also a Dividend King. It has increased its dividend for more than 50 years running. The payout yields a healthy 2.7% annually.Despite this record of success, Sysco’s stock is cheap. It trades at just 16 times next year’s earnings estimates and a fraction of its sales. It has over $750 million in cash in the bank, and its free cash flow more than doubled to 980 million last quarter. With earnings expected to grow 16% a year for the next five years, Sysco is definitely a stock worth a $1,000 investment.York Water (YORW)vats of waterSource: nostal6ie / Shutterstock.comHere’s something to try and wrap your head around. When York Water (NASDAQ:YORW) made its first dividend payment to investors, James Monroe — the last president of the country’s Founding Fathers — was in office. York hasn’t missed a single dividend payment for 205 years. Mind. Blown.York is a small utility stock that provides clean water and wastewater services to 54 municipalities in south-central Pennsylvania. While it does grow by acquiring more customers, revenue increases generally result from rate increases authorized by regulators. It’s a sleepy little under-the-radar stock that deserves your attention. It may be the company people had in mind when they came up with utilities being “widow and orphan stocks.”York is one of the best dividend stocks to buy because water treatment and wastewater elimination are essential. Just like people need the drugs, Johnson &amp; Johnson makes or the food Sysco delivers, they also need clean water. The utilities providing it also typically operate as a monopoly or duopoly. With a captured audience, York is a reliable and dependable dividend stock.You’re not going to see meteoric growth from York. What you get instead is a steady hand at the tiller. It’s ballast for your portfolio. The dividend currently yields 1.8% annually. It seems likely this patriarch of dividend stocks will be around for another 200 years and still pay a dividend year in and year out. It’s why York Water is one of the top companies to consider for your next $1,000 dividend stock investment.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in JNJ and SYY stock.

13,eb628838-9e4f-3e0c-a5f3-c44bb2628108,PSX,2023-07-16,The 7 Best Retirement Stocks to Buy in July,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-retirement-stocks-buy-184652294.html,1688928412,STORY,"['IBM', 'SRE', 'ALB', 'MCD', 'PSX']","[While the post-pandemic market cycle inspired much speculation into the mix, forward-thinking investors may want to use this time to strategize the best retirement stocks in July. Fundamentally, the future arrives sooner than you expect. Therefore, it pays to plan ahead.And believe me, time flies, mostly as a derivation of mathematics. For example, from age 10 to age 20, a child transitioning to adulthood has lived a “lifetime” to get there. However, from age 20 to age 30, we’re talking half a lifetime (relative to the 10-year-old child’s perspective). As you jump from decade to decade, time from a perceptional view “accelerates” if you will.The point of the above paragraph is to emphasize that you shouldn’t waste time. Therefore, you want to stock up on retirement stocks to buy as early as possible. Below are several compelling ideas to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlbemarle (ALB)retirement stocks an older couple sitting on a dock and looking at a pamphletSource: ShutterstockWhile electric vehicles may represent the future of personal mobility and transportation, as an idea for the best retirement stocks in July, the narrative becomes quite tricky. At the end of the day, it’s anyone’s guess which EV brand will dominate over the next several decades. A much safer idea (relatively speaking) is Albemarle (NYSE:ALB). As a specialty chemicals manufacturing firm, its focus on lithium for the EV sector should be relevant indefinitely.To be fair, ALB isn’t the most exciting idea for retirement stocks to buy. Then again, this space isn’t built for excitement but rather for predictable and steady gains over time. I genuinely believe that’s the situation with Albemarle. By pretty much all accounts, both industry leaders and policymakers will push for broader EV integration. That’s only going to make ALB rise in pertinence.Currently, the company only features a forward yield of 0.7%, which is really nothing. However, the underlying EV market and its overall stout financials make ALB one of the top retirement stocks for July.Story continuesMcDonald’s (MCD)a financial planner showing a couple a piece of paperSource: ShutterstockA fixture in the American fast-food industry, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) at first glance might seem a risky proposition for best retirement stocks in July. While the Golden Arches may be iconic, the “problem” is that younger consumers tend to focus on healthier eating. Now, one would have to stretch credulity to characterize anything associated with McDonald’s as healthy. Still, MCD has a key element working in its favor.Specifically, social normalization trends should augur well for the fast-food giant. Based on an Axios report, companies have aggressively pushed for at least hybrid schedules for their employees. That means you’re going to see increased demand for breakfast products as worker bees attempt to make their commute more tolerable. Also, McDonald’s offers an excellent alternative for fancy (read overpriced) coffeeshop beverages.Presently, MCD carries a forward yield of 2.06%. Though it’s not particularly generous, it’s higher than the consumer discretionary sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Thus, it’s a solid idea for investing in retirement stocks.Bunge (BG)retirement stocks: miniature figurines climb a staircase made of coinsSource: ShutterstockAn American agribusiness and food company, Bunge (NYSE:BG) makes an excellent case for the best retirement stocks in July. Mostly, that’s because Bunge aligns with the traditional approach to planning for the future: acquiring income-providing enterprises that feature relevant, predictable businesses. Aside from rare geopolitical flashpoints, the agricultural industry is generally predictable because of its critical nature.Obviously, humans need sustenance to survive and thrive. Further, BG makes a particularly strong case for high-potential retirement stocks because of its value proposition. Due in part to disruptions to global agricultural and food-related commodities, the underlying sector has underperformed. However, this circumstance also sees BG being undervalued relative to forward earnings.Featuring solid revenue growth and consistent profitability, BG seems a worthwhile candidate for (relatively) mild speculation. Better yet, the company carries a forward yield of 2.7%, above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, its payout ratio sits at 23.14%, indicating high confidence in yield sustainability.Sempra Energy (SRE)an elderly couple jumping up in a white household. Cheap retirement stocksSource: ShutterstockIn real estate, it’s all about location, location, location. And one could make the same argument for public utilities, which is why I peg Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) as one of the best retirement stocks in July. While it’s not exactly a favorite enterprise among its users, here’s the reality: Sempra covers much of the lucrative Southern California market. Since the Golden State is the U.S. economic engine, folks here can pay their bills.Now, I don’t want to get bogged down with the discussion that clearly, not everybody lives the good life in Cali. However, people here generally tend to be educated, work high-paying jobs, or are otherwise go-getters. Naturally, such a framework serves the utility provider well. Like other companies in its ecosystem, Sempra doesn’t have sterling financial metrics. But it’s consistently profitable as you might expect.Also, what makes it a great candidate for retirement stocks to buy is its passive income. Carrying a forward yield of 3.3%, the payout ratio sits at a decent 49.71%. Also, Sempra enjoys 19 years of consecutive dividend increases.Phillips 66 (PSX)Coins stacked next to a calculator that says ""retirement plan."" Retirement stocks.Source: kenary820 / ShutterstockAt first glance, the inclusion of Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) among the best retirement stocks in July appears to clash with Albemarle. After all, Phillips 66 represents a downstream hydrocarbon energy giant. In contrast, the political and ideological winds favor EV integration, not building combustion-powered cars. So, what gives?Well, I’ve got to be real with you all – I don’t see combustion cars fading out altogether. Sure, EVs may become a much more prominent fixture on our roadways. However, sparking a majority transition to EVs will almost surely require a power infrastructure overhaul. We already have enough problems with air conditioners running during a heat wave, let alone charging full-sized vehicles. Therefore, Phillips 66 should be surprisingly relevant for years to come.Notably, because of the aggressively hawkish monetary policy, the underlying sector has underperformed. Subsequently, the market prices PSX at a forward multiple of 7.2, which is undervalued. For passive income, the company features a forward yield of 4.4%. As well, its payout ratio sits at 35.74%, providing confidence regarding yield sustainability.IBM (IBM)A pink piggy bank sits on top of piles of cash to represent cash-rich stocksSource: ShutterstockPerhaps a more classic idea for best retirement stocks in July, legacy technology giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) offers myriad relevancies. Sure, that wasn’t always the case. Years ago, “Big Blue” held on too strongly to its legacy business units. However, that was then and this is now. Today’s IBM focuses on contemporary and pertinent innovations such as the hybrid cloud network.Moving forward, what I appreciate about IBM as one of the top retirement stocks for July is that it provides core competencies without ego and fanfare. DO you want artificial intelligence? IBM has more than proven itself with IBM Watson and other enterprise-level digital intelligence solutions. How about cybersecurity for corporate clients? Or the blockchain? Whatever tech you can think of, Big Blue has you covered.What investors of high-potential retirement stocks will really appreciate is the passive income. Currently, the tech juggernaut carries a forward yield of 5.02%. While its payout ratio stands a bit on the high side at 66.53%, the company also features 30 years of consecutive dividend increases. That’s a status management that won’t give up cheaply.International Paper (IP)a man sitting behind a pile of cashSource: ShutterstockAnother classic idea for the best retirement stocks in July, International Paper (NYSE:IP) is boring. Maybe a little bit too boring, which may then raise some alarm bells for investors. Should they pile into an “analog” enterprise when the world is rapidly moving toward advanced digitalization? On paper (no pun intended), IP seems to contradict the bullish thesis for IBM.However, much like the situation with EVs and the mobility paradigm, I don’t see digitization efforts completely eliminating paper from the personal and business ecosystem. At the most cynical level, paper can’t be hacked into, offering a viable backup. Moreover, the rise and dominance of e-commerce will ironically boost the paper and packaging market. Thus, IP should be surprisingly relevant.Also, it’s difficult to overlook passive income if you’re investing in retirement stocks. At the time of writing, International Paper commands a forward yield of 5.91%. In fairness, the payout ratio of 81.34% is elevated. However, if you’re seeking a little spice and contrarianism in your long-term portfolio, IP may be enticing.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

These companies also possess reasonable upside, driven by a number of growth catalysts. Indeed, I’m a believer that each company could reasonably surge higher, given the quality of these key catalysts.Fortunately, each of these companies are relatively low-risk, given their size and dominant market positions. That means they aren’t likely to suffer extreme downside moves in their stock prices, like many of their smaller counterparts. In short, these are relatively safe stocks providing a combination of value and growth potential. Even if these particular picks don’t interest a given investor, other value stocks may be worth considering, due to the balance and stability these stocks can provide in a balanced portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSouthern Copper (SCCO)Stacks of copper tubingSource: ShutterstockSouthern Copper (NYSE:SCCO) is a value stock that investors should consider, primarily due to the company’s ties to the all-important copper mining sector. Currently, it might not be the best time to buy SCCO stock, as it appears the company’s shares are fully-priced. However, if this stock falls to its average target price (around $65 per share), I think that will represent a good potential entry point.So, why is copper so important? Well, copper is considered to be a broad indicator of overall economic health. Copper is used in just about everything, from homebuilding to electronics, because it is an excellent conductor of electricity. So, as overall economic demand increases, so too does the demand for copper. Accordingly, when copper prices are rising, that correlates to a strengthening economy. Thus, for those bullish on global demand growth picking up, copper is a great way to play this trend.In 2023, copper prices have traded in a relatively narrow range, after jumping in January. That said, there’s reason to consider SCCO stock aside from its capital appreciation upside – its dividend currently yields more than 4.5%. That dividend can partially or fully offset some of the commodity price-related declines the stock sees over time, providing improved return stability for investors.Story continuesQualcomm (QCOM)Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is likely to catch on in the coming weeks and months as another way to benefit from AI-related growth in the semiconductor sector. Chatter is beginning to pick up on this topic, but investors appear more focused on Qualcomm’s handset-related issues than the stock’s potential upside.Essentially, handset demand is worsening, as economic pressures are forcing consumers to reconsider buying expensive new cell phones. That directly affects Qualcomm, as the company is a major chip supplier for the smartphone industry.This waning demand resulted in weak quarterly results for Qualcomm when it released earnings in early May. The company’s revenue fell by 17%, and its net income dropped by 42%.But there’s a silver lining, of sorts. The company’s automotive chip revenues increased 20% year-over-year, and Qualcomm also increased its dividend by 7%. Even after this increase, the company’s dividend remains sustainable, given its reasonable payout ratio of only 32%.Qualcomm is also quietly making inroads into various AI-related verticals, positioning itself as a potential key supplier in this high-growth area. In short, it’s easy to make a “buy the dip” case for QCOM stock right now.Pfizer (PFE)blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stockSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comPfizer (NYSE:PFE) has been on a prolonged downturn in 2023, resulting in PFE stock sinking from more than $50 per share to around $35 per share at the time of writing. That said, this slide has left the stock seriously undervalued in the eyes of many investors (myself included).Wall Street thinks Pfizer shares are roughly 33% undervalued, at the time of writing. Some experts, including those at Gurufocus, believe there’s even more upside, with this group suggesting PFE stock could nearly double from current levels.Aside from analyst price targets, I see another reason to be upbeat about Pfizer. The key growth driver I’m focused on is the recent rise in obesity treatments.Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) are chasing blockbuster revenues with the launch of their injectable obesity drugs that have received FDA approval. Pfizer has announced that it will be chasing those same revenues, utilizing a different path forward.Instead of an injectable drug, Pfizer will seek FDA approval for an obesity treatment in pill form. Undoubtedly, this is a complex space, with many variables and competitive factors to consider. But Pfizer is blazing its own path forward, looking to create the latest blockbuster pill, utilizing the vast resources it gained from the success of its Covid-19 vaccine.Cisco Systems (CSCO)cisco (CSCO) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a tech stock that typically doesn’t get lumped together with its more exciting counterparts in the technology sector. That’s because Cisco provides networking and security solutions that are far less exciting and groundbreaking than many of its high-growth peers. This reality also helps explain why CSCO stock remains a value option for tech investors.Further, despite Cisco Systems’ strong recent quarter in which it beat guidance, there are concerns that continue to hamper its stock price. Analysts and investors are concerned that enterprise networking demand may fall as oversupply becomes an increasingly important issue.Now, Cisco Systems did provide guidance that revenue growth this quarter should be just as strong as it was during the first three months of 2023, if not slightly stronger. The company estimated that revenue growth could come in as high as 16%.Additionally, the firm believes sales should grow 10% over the course of this fiscal year. Those projections suggest that demand concerns are likely overstated. Indeed, CSCO stock looks a lot like QCOM stock, in that both offer reasonably-strong upside, dividend income, and a chance to prove the critics wrong.General Motors (GM)Cadillac car and SUV dealership. Cadillac offers a full line of gas and electric EV vehicles. GM stockSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comI’m about to corroborate the same argument that has propelled General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock higher over the last few years. Electric vehicles are going to be a game-changer for GM, sooner or later. While an immediate impact may not necessarily be felt in July, it’s clear that the company’s heavy investment in EVs should eventually be reflected in a rising share price.Now, GM stock hasn’t exploded higher yet, due to a few key issues plaguing the company. A significant gap remains between General Motors and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in terms of raw sales. Additionally, GM sold only 20,760 EVs in the first quarter. That was approximately 1/8th as many as the 161,000 EVs that Tesla sold in the U.S. over the same time frame.Competitive factors are important to consider when it comes to GM stock. While things don’t look bright when one compares General Motors to Tesla, GM did just about double Ford’s (NYSE:F) EV sales in Q1. An arguent could be made that Mustang production was shut down for retooling, benefiting GM in that volume race, but a win is a win.Last year, GM announced that it anticipated it would overtake Tesla in terms of sales volume some time around the middle of this decade. GM stock is dirt-cheap relative to earnings, so there’s a strong argument for buying GM stock now and holding for the long-term, for those bullish on increased competition in the EV race.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lettering on a corporate office in New York City.Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is essentially in the best position of any U.S. bank right now. It was already the biggest U.S. bank prior to the recent regional banking crisis. However, JPMorgan capitalized on its size and resources to deftly maneuver into an even stronger position as a result of that crisis.JPMorgan played an important role as an anchor for the entire banking sector, being among the consortium of banks that propped up the regional banking sector. Indeed, the company wins PR points in that regard, considering the cynical headlines that were spinning at the time.Additionally, JPMorgan picked up some of the best assets from many of the failed regional banks in this crisis. It took First Republic’s wealth management clientele in one deal. So, it’s clear that JPMorgan’s intent wasn’t purely altruistic in its bid to stave off a crisis of confidence in the banking sector.UPS (UPS)Close up of UPS logo printed on a delivery truck; partial view of the driver sitting at the wheel, waiting at a red traffic light in south San Francisco baySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comUPS (NYSE:UPS) is a stock investors should consider both for its leading position within the logistics industry and its reasonable valuation on a price-earnings basis currently.There are a few things to consider in relation to UPS’ moderate price-earnings ratio. One, it simply suggests this stock trades at a discounted level, given how important UPS is to the U.S. economy. Investors should arguably be willing to pay more for a dollar of UPS earnings, given its position within its industry and within the economy overall.Two, the company’s median price-earnings ratio over the past decade is roughly 50% higher than it is currently. This suggests that investors have long known that UPS’ earnings are more valuable than they are being priced right now. As capital looks for bargains, I’d bet that some of this capital flows into UPS stock due to this simple fact.Like some of the other stocks on this list, UPS is a company that’s greatly impacted by macro economic factors. Accordingly, it may be unsurprising to see the company’s revenue decline from $24.4 billion to $22.9 billion in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. That said, UPS will continue to act as a barometer for the overall economy, so for those bullish on long-term growth, this is a great value pick right now for optimists.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Imagining analysts as obsessive, encyclopedic nerds of the stock markets, it’s easy to presume their word is gold. However, savvy investors would know that it isn’t always the case.Investing in analyst-recommended stocks necessitates a balanced approach, free from extreme pessimism or unwarranted optimism. That’s because the stock market is incredibly dynamic and often impossible to predict. Hence, though you shouldn’t mindlessly follow analyst-loved stocks, you cannot outright dismiss them either.Understanding the “why” behind an analyst’s upgrade is essential. Perhaps they perceive a stock as undervalued or believe an already thriving company still has room to grow. Therefore, investors should tread with care and curiosity when it comes to these top analyst picks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTop Analyst Picks: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills.

AMD is critical in fueling cloud platforms for tech behemoths such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), offering a diverse array of chips, powerful central processing, and data processing units.Moreover, it recently unveiled its advanced GPU, MI300X, demonstrating its resolve to stand toe-to-toe with Nvidia. Interestingly, Amazon Web Services is exploring potential use, hinting at a possible collaboration with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Beyond AI, AMD’s chips drive some of the leading gaming consoles, further diversifying its growth potential.Top Analyst Picks: Splunk (SPLK) tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comStory continuesTipranks Analyst Forecast: Moderate Buy, 13.4% UpsideSplunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) is a powerhouse in data analytics, aiding businesses grappling with massive data sets, which continue to perform incredibly well.

Last year, as global commodity prices catapulted, Petrobras found itself basking in the limelight. Specifically, the behemoth generated a whopping $121 billion in revenue and $38 billion in net income, thanks mainly to the appreciation of Brent crude oil and robust domestic sales.The ascension of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to the presidency stirred Petrobras’s stock into a whirlwind of uncertainty, with forecasts pointing towards amplified state interference. However, the feared governmental grip didn’t take hold as projected, and Petrobras’s stock surprised many, surging almost 50% since the beginning of the year.Petrobras transformed its immense net income into a dividend bonanza for shareholders, distributing over $43 billion in 2022. Even as Brent crude oil prices stabilize, Petrobras remains a robust, profitable, enticing, undervalued player.Adobe (ADBE)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB.

Reported EPS is $1.25, expectations were $1.17.Operator: Welcome, and thank you for joining the Wells Fargo Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.John Campbell: Good morning. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf, and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials.Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.Charlie Scharf: Thank you, John. And good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll make some brief comments about our second quarter results and then update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review second quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some second quarter highlights. We had solid results in the quarter with revenue, pre-tax pre-provision profit, diluted earnings per share, and ROTCE, all higher than a year ago. The revenue growth reflected strong net interest income growth as well as higher non-interest income. While our efficiency ratio improved and we continued to make progress on our efficiency initiatives, we had modest expense growth from a year ago.Story continuesNet charge-offs have continued to increase from historical low levels, but overall credit quality was strong and consumer and business balance sheets remain healthy. We increased our allowance for credit losses by $949 million, primarily driven by our office portfolio as well as growth in our credit card portfolio. While we haven't seen significant losses in our office portfolio today, our detailed loan by loan review of the portfolio has given us a sense how the next several quarters could play out. We've also considered a number of stressed scenarios, all of which informed our actions this quarter. Mike will discuss this in more detail, but I want to make the point that it is very hard to look at any one statistic and determine the risk in the portfolio.Loss content will be driven by a combination of factors, including but not limited to, property type, location, lease rates, lease renewal notice dates, loan structure and borrower behavior. Most importantly, our CRE teams remain focused on working with our clients’ portfolio surveillance and de-risking to minimize loss content. Both commercial and consumer average loans were up from a year ago, but were down from the first quarter as the economy has slowed and we've taken some credit tightening actions. Credit card spending remained strong, but the rate of growth has slowed from the outsized growth rates we saw throughout 2022. Debit card spending was flat from a year ago with growth in discretionary spend offset by declines in non-discretionary spend.Average deposits were down from the first quarter, driven by lower consumer deposits, while the decline in commercial deposits slowed. Now let me update you on progress we've made on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk and control work. Regulatory pressure on banks with long-standing issues such as ours continues to grow and as such our continued intensive effort to complete the build-out of an appropriate risk and control framework for a company of our size and complexity is critical. I've continued to emphasize that this is our top priority and will remain so and that while we have implemented substantial portions of the work required, we have more implementation to do as well as work to make sure the changes operate effectively over time.As I've said before, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions until the work is complete. While we're devoting all necessary resources to our risk and control work, we're also continuing to invest in our business to better serve our customers and help drive growth. Our consumer customers have continued to increase their use of our mobile app. We added over 1 million mobile active customers over the past year and mobile logins increased 9% from a year ago. Fargo, our new AI-powered virtual assistant, is now live on our mobile app for all consumer customers. Since launching at the end of April, our customers have interacted with Fargo over 4 million times. We've continued to make important hires, bringing new expertise to Wells Fargo in businesses we are looking to grow.We named Barry Simmons as the new Head of National Sales in Wealth &amp; Investment Management. He’ll be critical in our efforts to better serve clients and help advisors grow their business. We also continued to attract veteran bankers in Corporate and Investment Banking, hiring new managing directors in our banking division in priority growth areas, including a Co-Head of Global Mergers and Acquisitions, Co-Head of Financial Institutions and new heads of financial sponsors, equity capital markets, healthcare and technology, media and telecom. We also continue to focus on better serving our communities. We announced a 10-year strategic partnership with T.D. Jakes Group that could result in up to $1 billion in capital and financing for Wells Fargo to drive economic vitality and inclusivity in communities across America.The Wells Fargo Foundation awarded $7.5 million to Habitat for Humanity to build and repair more than 360 homes nationwide. We've worked with Habitat for Humanity for nearly three decades and donated more than $129 million since 2010. Wells Fargo signed on as the first anchor funder of UnidosUS HOME initiative to create 4 million new Latino homeowners by 2030. We provided the initial grant to start a fund launched by FinTech Hello Alice to improve access to credit and capital for small business owners who are members of underserved groups, including women. We continue to open HOPE Inside centers in Wells Fargo branches, including six during the first half of 2023 with plans to reach 20 markets by the end of this year. The centers help empower community members to achieve their financial goals through financial education workshops and free one-on-one coaching.We published our 2023 diversity, equity and inclusion report which highlights the progress we've made in our DE&amp;I strategy and initiatives, both inside our company and the communities where we live and work. However, we have more work to do to achieve enduring results that will require long-term commitments. Looking ahead, the US economy continues to perform better than many expected and although there will likely be continued economic slowing and uncertainty remains, it is quite possible the range of scenarios will narrow over the next few quarters. This year's Federal Reserve stress test affirmed that we remain in a strong capital position, reflecting the value of our franchise and benefits of our operating model. This capital strength allows us to serve our customers' financial needs while continuing to prudently return excess capital to our shareholders.As we previously announced, we expect to increase our third quarter comp stock dividend by 17% to $0.35 per share, subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month. We've repurchased $8 billion of common stock during the first half of this year and the stress test results demonstrated that we have the capacity to continue to repurchase common stock. Regulators have signaled that the Basel III Endgame proposal, which could be out as soon as this summer, will include higher capital requirements that will be skewed to the country's largest banks. While there's some speculation that capital requirements could increase by 20%, we don't know what the impact will be to Wells Fargo. However, we do expect our capital requirements will increase.While any changes to regulatory capital requirements are expected to be phased in gradually over several years, we are considering the potential impacts in contemplating the amounts of our future repurchases. Our balance sheet is strong. We've increased and remained focused on increasing our earnings capacity and continue to like our competitive position. We remain prepared for a variety of scenarios and our steadfast commitment to our risk and control build-out, coupled with our continued focus on financial and credit risk management, allows us to support our customers throughout economic cycles. I will now turn the call over to Mike.investment, accounting, growth, bank, banking, concept, data, benefit, business, wealth, profit, rate, capital, trade, foreign, market, bill, chart, euro, world, background,violetkaipa/Shutterstock.comMike Santomassimo: Thank you, Charlie. And good morning everyone. Net income for the second quarter was $4.9 billion or $1.25 per diluted common share, both up from a year ago, reflecting the progress we are making on improving our performance, which I’ll highlight throughout the call. Starting with capital and liquidity on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio was 10.7%, down approximately 10 basis points from the first quarter. During the second quarter, we repurchased $4 billion in common stock and as Charlie highlighted, subject to Board approval, we expect to increase our common stock dividend in the third quarter. Our CET1 ratio was 1.5 percentage points above our current regulatory minimum plus buffers and was 1.8 percentage points above our expected new regulatory minimum plus buffers starting in the fourth quarter of this year.While we expect to repurchase more common stock this year, we believe continuing to maintain significant excess capital is appropriate until there's more clarity on the new capital requirements that Charlie highlighted. Our liquidity position remained strong in the second quarter with our liquidity coverage ratio approximately 23 percentage points above the regulatory minimum. Turning to credit quality on Slide 5. Overall credit quality remained strong, but as expected, net loan charge-offs continued to increase from historically low levels and were 32 basis points of average loans in the second quarter. Commercial net loan charge offs increased $137 million from the first quarter to 15 basis points of average loans. Approximately half of the increase was in commercial banking where the losses were borrower-specific with little signs of systematic weakness across the portfolio.The rest of the increase was driven by higher losses in commercial real estate, primarily in the office portfolio. I'll share some more details on the CRE office exposure on the next slide. Consumer net loan charge-offs increased modestly, up $23 million from the first quarter to 58 basis points of average loans. The increase primarily came from the credit card portfolio as residential mortgage loans continue to have net recoveries and auto losses declined. While consumer credit performance remained solid overall, and we’ve continued to take incremental credit tightening actions across the portfolios, we expect consumer net loan charge-offs will continue to gradually increase. Non-performing assets increased 14% from the first quarter as lower non-accrual loans across the consumer portfolios were more than offset by higher commercial non-accrual loans, primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio.Our allowance for credit losses increased $949 million in the second quarter, primarily from -- for commercial real estate office loans as well as for higher credit card balances. We've updated Slide 6, which highlights our commercial real estate portfolio. We had $154.3 billion of commercial real estate loans outstanding at the end of the second quarter with $33.1 billion of office loans, which were down modestly from the first quarter and represented 3% of our total loans outstanding. The office market continues to be weak and the composition of our office portfolio was relatively consistent with what we shared with you in the first quarter. As Charlie mentioned, our CRE teams are focused on surveillance and de-risking which includes reducing exposures and closely monitoring at-risk loans.This quarter, we added a table to this slide that breaks down our CRE office disclosure in the context of our broader CRE portfolio. As the slide shows, our office loans at the end of the second quarter were primarily in corporate investment banking and that is also where we had the most non-accrual loans and the highest level of allowance for credit losses. Last quarter, we disclosed for the first time the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for the office portfolio in the corporate investment bank, which increased from 5.7% at the end of the first quarter to 8.8% at the end of the second quarter. This quarter, we are also providing our allowance for credit losses for our total CRE office portfolio which was 6.6% at the end of the second quarter, up from 4.4% at the end of the first quarter.As we highlighted last quarter, we're providing this data to give you more insight into the portfolio, but each property situation is different and there are many variables that can determine performance, which is why we regularly review this portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis. For example, we have properties that are experiencing increased vacancies where borrowers have decided to inject equity and make investments to improve the property even in cities with more difficult fundamentals. We also have properties that are well leased and performing, but borrowers need help refinancing. In those situations, we are working with borrowers to restructure, which in many cases includes some paydown in balance. There are also situations that result in a sale or workout of the asset.We will continue to closely monitor this portfolio, but as has been the case in prior cycles, this will likely play out over an extended period of time as we actively work with borrowers to help resolve issues that they may be facing. On Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were relatively stable from the first quarter and were up 2% from a year ago, driven by higher commercial and industrial loans in commercial banking and credit card loans. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 247 basis points from a year ago and 30 basis points from the first quarter due to the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 7% from a year ago, predominantly driven by deposit outflows in our consumer and wealth businesses reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher yielding alternatives.While down from a year ago, average commercial deposits were relatively stable in the first quarter and average deposits grew in corporate and investment banking. As expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase, up 30 basis points from the first quarter to 113 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to the rising interest rates. Our mix of non-interest bearing deposits declined from 32% in the first quarter to 30% in the second quarter but remained above pre-pandemic levels. Turning to net interest income on Slide 8. Second quarter net interest income was $13.2 billion, up 29% from a year ago, as we continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates. The $173 million decline from the first quarter was primarily due to lower deposit balances, partially offset by one additional day in the quarter.At the beginning of the year, we expected full year net interest income to grow by approximately 10% compared with 2022. We currently expect full year 2023 net interest income to increase approximately 14% compared with 2022. There are a variety of factors that we've considered in our expectation for the rest of the year. We are assuming modest growth in loans, some additional deposit outflows and migration from non-interest bearing to interest bearing deposits, as well as continued deposit repricing including competitive pricing on commercial deposits. Additionally, we are using the recent rate curve which is shown on the slide. As a reminder, many of the factors driving net interest income are uncertain and we will need to see how each of these assumptions plays out during the remainder of the year.Turning to expenses on Slide 9. Non-interest expense grew $125 million or 1% from a year ago. At the beginning of the year, we expected our full year 2023 non-interest expense, excluding operational losses, to be approximately $50.2 billion. We currently expect our full year 2023 non-interest expense, excluding operating losses, to be approximately $51 billion. The increase includes higher severance expense due to actions we have taken and plan to take in 2023 as attrition has been slower than expected. Of note, we've reduced headcount each quarter since the third quarter of 2020 and headcount declined 1% from the first quarter and 4% from a year ago. As a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses.Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 10. Consumer small business banking revenue increased 19% from a year ago as higher net interest income, driven by the impact of higher interest rates was partially offset by lower deposit related fees, driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year. We continue to reduce the underlying costs around the business as customers migrate to digital, including mobile. We've reduced our number of branches by 4% and branch staffing by 10% from a year ago. Home lending revenue declined 13% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income due to loan spread compression and lower mortgage originations. We continued to reduce headcount in the second quarter, down 37% from a year ago and we expect staffing levels will further decline during the second half of the year.Credit card revenue increased 1% from a year ago due to the higher loan balances. Payment rates were down from a year ago, but have been stable over the last three quarters, remained above pre-pandemic levels. New account growth remained strong, up 17% from a year ago and importantly, the quality of the new accounts continue to be better than what we were booking historically. Auto revenue declined 13% from a year ago, driven by continued loan spread compression and lower loan balances. Personal lending revenue was up 17% from a year ago due to higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 77% from a year ago and increased 18% from the first quarter, reflecting seasonality. We funded our last corresponding loan in the second quarter with our current focus being serving our bank customers as well as borrowers in minority communities.The size of our auto portfolio has declined for five consecutive quarters and balances were down 7% at the end of the second quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volume declined 11% from a year ago reflecting credit tightening actions as well as continued price competition. As Charlie highlighted, debit card spend was flat in the second quarter compared to a year ago, spending on fuel due to the lower gas prices, home improvement and travel are the largest declines compared to last year. Credit card spending continued to be strong and was up 13% from a year ago. Growth rates were stable throughout the second quarter with fuel the only category down year-over-year. Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 51% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances.Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 13% year-over-year, primarily due to higher loan balances. Average loan balances were up 12% in second quarter compared to a year ago, driven by new customer growth and higher line utilization. Average loan balances have grown for eight consecutive quarters thought the pace of growth has slowed. Average loans were up 1% from the first quarter with loan growth in asset-based lending and leasing driven by seasonally higher inventory levels while middle market banking loans were flat. Turning to Corporate Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 37% from a year ago, driven by stronger treasury management results, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and higher lending revenue.The growth in investment banking fees from a year ago reflected write-downs taken in the second quarter of 2022 on unfunded leveraged finance commitments. Commercial real estate revenue grew 26% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances. Markets revenue increased 29% from a year ago, driven by the higher trading results across most asset classes. Our strong trading results during the first half of the year were driven by underlying market conditions and also reflected the benefit of our investments in technology and talent, which have allowed us to broaden our franchise and generate more trading flows. Average loans were down 2% from a year ago and 1% from the first quarter. The decline from the quarter was driven by banking, reflecting the combination of slow demand and modestly lower loan utilization.On Slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue was down 2% compared to a year ago, driven by a decline in asset-based fees due to lower market valuations. Growth in net interest income from a year ago was driven by the impact of higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher yielding alternatives. However, outflows into cash alternatives slowed in the second quarter. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter. So second quarter results reflected the market valuations as of April 1, which were down from a year ago. Asset-based fees in the third quarter will reflect higher market valuations as of July 1. Average loans were down 3% from a year ago, primarily due to decline in securities-based lending.Slide 15 highlights our Corporate results. Revenue increased $751 million from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and lower impairments of equity securities in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. In summary, our results in the second quarter reflect a continued improvement in our earnings capacity. We grew revenue and had strong growth in pre-tax provision profit. As expected, our net charge-offs continue to slowly increase from historical lows and our allowance for credit losses increased. We are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit-tightening actions where we believe appropriate. Our capital levels remain strong and we continue to repurchase common stock.

(NASDAQ:ROST), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 85% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Last week’s 3.8% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The one-year return on investment is currently 45% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Ross Stores. Check out our latest analysis for Ross Stores ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Ross Stores?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Ross Stores already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Ross Stores' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Ross Stores is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.2% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are BlackRock, Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 7.8%.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 18 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Ross StoresWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.We can see that insiders own shares in Ross Stores, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$753m. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 13% stake in Ross Stores. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on a Californian retirement and best places to retire in California, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in California.A Californian RetirementAccording to Northwestern Mutual, Americans need $1.27 million for a comfortable retirement. However, respondents in their survey have revealed they still need to meet their million-dollar retirement goal. In fact, they have only $89,300 set aside, on average. The question is, is this amount enough to sustain retirement amidst rising inflation and longer life expectancies?Well, the answer is that it depends on where they choose to retire. The main determinants of how far retirement income can go are taxes and the cost of living. To get the best bang for their retirement buck, retirees are exploring diverse destinations within and outside the USA. Many of them are flocking towards the South, some are venturing into Central America, and others are opting for the magnificent Caribbean.Prospective retirees are now saving with $1.27 million goal in mind. However, for those wishing to retire in the Golden State, aka California, this sum may only last for a while. Home to big companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), California is an expensive yet dreamy retirement destination for many. The Missouri Economic Research &amp; Information Center notes that the cost of living index for the state is 134.5, implying that living expenses are 34.5% above the US average.Retiring in California has many pros and cons. As evident by the 134.5 cost-of-living index, many retirees may not be able to sustain their retirement income here for long. The $1 million savings may, in fact, last them for only 15 years, on average. Housing affordability is another challenge for retirees, especially in desirable locations. The income tax system is progressive, implying that retirement incomes, such as pension, may be subject to taxation.Story continuesHowever, many retirees still choose to forego these cons over the high quality of life the state promises. Beautiful coastlines, stunning mountains, and lush national parks are major reasons retirees choose the state. The robust healthcare system, and retirees have access to high-quality medical care. Moreover, there are many retirement communities in the state that ensure retirees live a life according to their preferences and needs.Best Places to Retire in CaliforniaCalifornia is often associated with a sense of magic and action. Understandably, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) brings the most magic in the state. The state also promotes a healthy and active lifestyle, and many places in California, such as San Jose, Santa Barbara, and San Francisco have been featured as the best places to retire for active adults by Insider Monkey. It is also home to Hollywood, considered the global center for the television and film industry. The state also has a reputation for fostering technological advancements in Silicon Valley, and some of the largest tech companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) are headquartered here.Therefore, retirees looking for the ultimate combination of nature, innovation, action, and health should know that California is the place to be in. According to Forbes, the top ten cities to retire in California include Bakersfield, Fresno, Modesto, Oxnard, Vallejo, San Jose, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and Sacramento. For retirees who wish to live here but wish for more affordable options, smaller inland towns and communities can be ideal. As such, Vacaville, Citrus Heights, Roseville, and Fairfield are some of the best places to retire in California on a budget. Another type of location that is a hit with retirees is beach towns. Good weather, water-based activities, and relaxation on the coast are the top reasons seniors move near the coast. For those looking for something similar, the best coastal towns in California to retire to are La Jolla in San Diego, Huntington Beach, Carmel-by-the-sea, and Santa Barbara. Many retirees also consider the southern part of California for its mild and sunny weather, coastal views, and entertainment offerings. As such, the best place to retire in southern California is Santa Clarita. Beautiful weather, small-town feel, and good quality of life are the top attractions of this place.16 Best Places to Retire in California in 2023andrii-ganzevych-fn_NefXqH5A-unsplashMethodologyIn order to compile the list of the best places to retire in California in 2023, we have used Niche, World Population Review, US Money News &amp; World Report, and Forbes as our sources. We used these sources to determine the number of times each place was recommended by each source, awarding one point each time a place was recommended.Since many places had the same scores, we decided to tie-break them on the basis of their cost of living. In the case where two places had the same scores, the least expensive place of them was awarded 0.2 additional points, while the other one was awarded 0.1 additional points. Similarly, out of 3 places, the least expensive place was awarded 0.3 additional points, the second least expensive with 0.2 additional points, and so on.We have also mentioned the cost of living and median housing prices of homes in the places discussed.

CEO Bob Iger stressed that gaining full ownership Hulu, by purchasing the minority share owned by Comcast, is now central to the media giant's comeback strategy. That position represents something of a shift from the lukewarm sentiments that Iger expressed about the mainly ad-driven streaming platform in the months following his return to the helm in November of last year. At the time, Iger suggested that Disney wanted to focus on its traditional, branded family fare and action-hero content, and move away from the kind of general entertainment epitomized by Hulu. Analysts speculated, often favorably, that Disney might sell its Hulu stake to raise sorely-needed cash for the likes of lowering debt or funding ESPN's full move from cable to over-the-top subscription.In May, Iger virtually guaranteed that a Comcast deal would happen by announcing that Disney+ and Hulu were melding their apps. But in this latest conversation with David Faber, Iger emphasized as never before the crucial importance of bundling Hulu into its offerings, and hence the urgency in clinching an agreement with the on-and-off antagonist run by Brian Roberts. ""[We] ultimately concluded that we would be better off having Hulu than not having Hulu,"" Iger told Faber. ""In terms of the path to profitability, combining Hulu and Disney+ is a major step in that direction.""Comcast's goal will be making things tough for the Magic KingdomThe importance that Iger accords Hulu as a linchpin in its revival playbook puts Comcast in a strong position to squeeze Disney. More than any other rivals in the brutal streaming wars, the two giants maneuver constantly to outfox one another. After Disney struck an agreement to buy Fox in 2018, Comcast launched a competing bid that failed, but forced its combatant to many billions more than an original price that already way overvalued the studio's assets. Disney introduced Disney+ at bargain prices designed to grab business from fledging such as Comcast's Peacock. And the Comcast alleged that Disney's stewardship of Hulu stymies the platform's vast promise. ""There are a lot of social issues between the two companies,"" Tom Rogers, former CEO of TIVO and first president of NBC Cable told Fortune. Comcast holds the whip hand, and is giving every sign that it will swing away. Adds Rogers, ""When you can put pressure on a competitor, why not do it?""Story continuesThe buyout arrangement gives Comcast several levers for pressing Disney on time, money, or maybe both. Today, Disney owns 67% of Hulu, and Comcast holds the remaining 33%. Disney gained its commanding position via the Fox purchase, which added 30% to its original stake, while Comcast became a minority shareholder when it bought NBCUniversal in 2011. On May 14, 2019, the two owners unveiled a ""put/call"" agreement to resolve Hulu's ""future ownership and governance."" Under the pact, Disney is granted full operating control over Hulu until the end of this year. Starting in January of 2024, Disney can require that Comcast sell its interest to Disney at ""fair market value,"" and Comcast can force Disney to buy its Hulu shares. The accord gives Hulu a minimum total value of $27.5 billion. So Disney must pay at least one-third of that number, or $9.2 billion, for the Comcast shares.Months ago, Roberts and other top Comcast execs expressed that Hulu isn't core to their franchises, and that they intend exercise their ""put"" to Disney. And after hinting at a possible sale earlier this year, Iger now confirms that Disney's a willing buyer. If the two sides don't agree on a negotiated price, it will be determined by binding arbitration. The arbitrator isn't named in the companies' filings, but it's rumored to be Goldman Sachs. The mechanics of the process, or whether a deadline applies, is also a mystery.Still, other mechanics that can influence what Comcast will receive are spelled out in its annual report. Comcast isn't obliged to cover its pro-rata share of any ""cash calls"" issued by Disney to cover, for example, needed investments or shortfalls in revenues at Hulu. But if Comcast declines to contribute, its percentage ownership in Hulu gets docked. Though how the formula works is unstated, Comcast's ownership can fall as low as 21% from the current 35%, depending on the capital calls it misses, before it's forced fund Hulu. Though neither side has said so, it's widely reported that Comcast isn't paying.Put simply, the conditions stipulate that Comcast will receive at least 21% of the minimum payment of $27.5 billion for its interest, or $5.8 billion. Why is that hypothetical number important? That guaranteed value has enabled Comcast to borrow $5.2 billion on its Hulu shares, a loan due for repayment in early 2024. So when Comcast gets the proceeds from Disney, it will pocket not the full amount but as little as less than half after repaying the $5.2 billion.Comcast could pressure Disney in three important waysComcast and Disney have already clashed over the latter's management of Hulu. Comcast wanted its partner to deploy Hulu as its principal streaming platform on the international stage. Instead, Disney used Disney+ as its flagship abroad, marketed under the Star brand first started in Asia. As the Wall Street Journal reported, Comcast initiated an arbitration proceeding claiming that instead of promoting Hulu as a global growth vehicle as promised, Disney was restricting its expansion and curbing its potential value.That dispute is a precursor to the first possible strategy for pressing Disney: Demanding a price far above the contractual minimum of $27.5 billion. At an investor conference in late May, Roberts asserted that Hulu should be valued on what the entire company would fetch if offered, possibly at auction, all all-comers. In December, NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell stated that ""We think it's worth a lot of money because it can be sold on a full-control basis, and Disney [will be] writing us a big check in '24.""During the 2020 and 2021 period when Wall Street was valuing streamers on their ballooning revenues and subs, Comcast reportedly valued its Hulu shares internally at many billions above the $9.2 billion minimum. It's virtually certain that Comcast will demand far more than that number. In that case, both sides will submit their estimates of value to the arbitrator, who will set the final figure. Due to Hulu's current, virtually breakeven profit status, analysts mostly agree it's unlikely that Disney will pay much over $10 billion. For example, Peter Supine of Wolfe Research has an estimate of $9 to $13 billion.The threat that Disney will need to pay an outrageous number is less menacing than the delay Comcast can cause. ""Comcast doesn't have a strong incentive to move quickly,"" says Rogers. ""The combination of the loan and the possible decrease in their percentage share because of the capital calls, plus the tax costs on a big cash boon, means it's not a major issue hanging over their heads."" By contrast, he says, Disney needs to sprint. ""While the deal is in negotiation or before the arbitrator, Disney can't make the case to investors that the Hulu deal will lead to a transformation in its streaming outlook. The more Iger promotes that story, the more the price he'd have to pay to Comcast goes up. As he suggest how valuable Disney is to him, it becomes evidence in the arbitration.""The thorniest issue: Disney can't fully combine Hulu and Disney+, and possibly ESPN+, until the deal is done. And time is of the essence. At Sun Valley, Iger stated that the decline in CBS, ESPN on cable and the other networks are caused by ""disruptive forces that are greater than I thought... we have to come to grips with now."" Rogers points out that Disney+ sub growth has stalled, and that Hulu's ad revenue per subscriber has fallen for five straight quarters. ""They can do some integration prior to the deal, such as putting up a tile so that you can access Hulu in the Disney+ interface. But that's different from a totally unified tech backbone, and getting all the marketing synergies that come from a single, unified service. They can't do that until they complete the transaction.""It's unclear how long Comcast could delay a deal by arguing over price. ""Time is the biggest variable in torturing Disney,"" concludes Rogers. Iger reigns as perhaps the greatest dealmaker in showbiz history, in assembling Fox, LucasFilm, Pixar and Marvel under one turreted castle. Clinching the shares he doesn't own in Hulu, from a determined foe, and doing it in a hurry, won't be anywhere near his most epic transaction, but could prove the most heroic of all.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Usually, such companies represent yield traps, enticing investors with their seemingly robust income-making prospects. But under the hood, they suffer from severe fundamental vulnerabilities.However, in other cases, speculative dividend stocks may stem from misunderstood businesses. Maybe they’re solid enterprises but fell under hard times for circumstances outside their control. Or, most investors don’t appreciate the forward-looking catalysts that may bolster returns. Either way, it’s possible to find diamonds in the rough. If you’re patient and can tolerate volatility, these high-risk high-reward stocks may be for you.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDevon Energy (DVN)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comOn paper, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) might seem too risky an idea for high-yield dividend stocks. With the hydrocarbon energy sector suffering under the weight of the Federal Reserve’s hawkish monetary policy, companies like Devon incurred significant red ink. For example, since the beginning of this year, DVN slipped more than 18% in equity value. Over the trailing one-year period, the stock declined over 11%.Nevertheless, on a fundamental note, social normalization trends – such as the return to the office – may boost traffic volumes to pre-pandemic levels. While that might be a contentious topic, it’s also the reality. According to Axios, companies have aggressively pushed for at least hybrid schedules for their employees. Cynically, then, this framework should lift the hydrocarbon players.As for the case for speculative dividend stocks, Devon makes a very compelling case. Right now, the energy giant carries a forward yield of 6.06%. That’s well above the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. Also, the payout ratio sits at 43.79%, translating to confidence in yield sustainability.Story continuesEPR Properties (EPR)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockStructured as a real estate investment trust, EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) focuses on entertainment businesses, such as cineplex operators and amusement parks. As a case for high-yield dividend stocks, EPR also seemingly suffers from a higher risk profile. After all, if the consumer economy suffers, companies levered to discretionary spending may plunge. While EPR got off to a blistering start this year, it’s down almost 4% in the trailing year.Still, here’s the deal with EPR Properties. First, one major cloud of uncertainty has faded regarding the bankruptcy of Regal Cinemas, one of EPR’s largest tenants. With the two entities inking a new deal, investors now have an air of predictability. Second, the box office happens to be a great bang for the buck regarding entertainment value. Thus, EPR’s one of the high-risk high-reward stocks to consider.Lastly, EPR carries a forward yield of 7.02%. In contrast, the real estate sector’s average yield is 4.46%. However, investors interested in speculative high-yield stocks should be aware that the payout ratio stands at just under 132%.British American Tobacco (BTI)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockUndeniably, British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) represents an extremely risky case for high-yield dividend stocks. Fundamentally, the prevalence of smoking prevalence around the world has declined. For an enterprise that features a presence in approximately 180 countries, that’s not exactly the stat investors would look for. If that wasn’t enough, BTI fell more than 18% since the beginning of this year.Also, the red ink isn’t a fluky situation. In the trailing year, BTI fell nearly 19%. Over the past five years, shares stumbled more than 36%. While no one will mistake British American as a confidence-inspiring enterprise, it’s also one of the dividend stocks with high speculative returns.Sure, smoking rates are falling practically everywhere. However, vaping rates have increased in their place. With British American commanding a strong portfolio of various vaping brands, it’s in a prime position to benefit.Finally, BTI carries a forward yield of 8.5%, well above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of only 1.89%. As well, the payout ratio is 55.35%, a decently sustainable figure.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:URI) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for United Rentals The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At United RentalsIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP &amp; COO, Dale Asplund, sold US$5.8m worth of shares at a price of US$436 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$445. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was 52% of Dale Asplund's stake.In total, United Rentals insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like United Rentals better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At United Rentals Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at United Rentals. Specifically, Executive VP &amp; CFO William Grace ditched US$261k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes United Rentals Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. United Rentals insiders own about US$137m worth of shares (which is 0.4% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At United Rentals Tell Us?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But since United Rentals is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

(NASDAQ:HAS) Trading At A 31% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hasbro-inc-nasdaq-trading-31-123804545.html,1689424684,STORY,['HAS'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Hasbro is US$92.35 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$64.10 suggests Hasbro is potentially 31% undervalued The US$76.18 analyst price target for HAS is 18% less than our estimate of fair valueHow far off is Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Hasbro Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$601.7mUS$827.8mUS$1.02bUS$1.11bUS$1.18bUS$1.24bUS$1.29bUS$1.34bUS$1.38bUS$1.42bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 6.26%Est @ 5.02%Est @ 4.14%Est @ 3.53%Est @ 3.11%Est @ 2.81% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% US$545US$678US$754US$745US$717US$681US$642US$601US$561US$522(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.4bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (11%– 2.1%) = US$17bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$17b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= US$6.4bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$13b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$64.1, the company appears quite undervalued at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Hasbro as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.413. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for HasbroStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Leisure market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Dividends are not covered by earnings and cashflows.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Hasbro, there are three further aspects you should assess:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 4 warning signs  with Hasbro (at least 2 which shouldn't be ignored)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Future Earnings: How does HAS's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

(NYSE:FIS) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/89-institutional-ownership-fidelity-national-110024798.html,1689505224,STORY,['FIS'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Fidelity National Information Services' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 21 shareholders own 51% of the company Recent sales by insiders Every investor in Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 89% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Fidelity National Information Services. See our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Fidelity National Information Services?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Fidelity National Information Services. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Fidelity National Information Services' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Fidelity National Information Services is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.0%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.4% and 6.1%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Fidelity National Information ServicesWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$102m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 10% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Fidelity National Information Services. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Fidelity National Information Services  that you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, the NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) share price is up 74% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 33% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 22% in the last year , including dividends .So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for NetApp While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.NetApp was able to grow its EPS at 19% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. We don't think it is entirely coincidental that the EPS growth is reasonably close to the 20% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that sentiment and expectations have not changed drastically. Au contraire, the share price change has arguably mimicked the EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that NetApp has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for NetApp the TSR over the last 3 years was 89%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that NetApp has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 22% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 2% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals How Quickly Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Increasing Earnings Per Share?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Impressively, Vertex Pharmaceuticals has grown EPS by 29% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. On the revenue front, Vertex Pharmaceuticals has done well over the past year, growing revenue by 16% to US$9.2b but EBIT margin figures were less stellar, seeing a decline over the last 12 months. If EBIT margins are able to stay balanced and this revenue growth continues, then we should see brighter days ahead.Story continuesThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Vertex Pharmaceuticals' future profits.Are Vertex Pharmaceuticals Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Vertex Pharmaceuticals has a market capitalisation of US$91b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$203m. We note that this amounts to 0.2% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Vertex Pharmaceuticals but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Does Vertex Pharmaceuticals Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?For growth investors, Vertex Pharmaceuticals' raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. Of course, identifying quality businesses is only half the battle; investors need to know whether the stock is undervalued. So you might want to consider this free discounted cashflow valuation of Vertex Pharmaceuticals.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

51,eb628838-9e4f-3e0c-a5f3-c44bb2628108,SRE,2023-07-16,The 7 Best Retirement Stocks to Buy in July,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-retirement-stocks-buy-184652294.html,1688928412,STORY,"['IBM', 'SRE', 'ALB', 'MCD', 'PSX']","[While the post-pandemic market cycle inspired much speculation into the mix, forward-thinking investors may want to use this time to strategize the best retirement stocks in July. Fundamentally, the future arrives sooner than you expect. Therefore, it pays to plan ahead.And believe me, time flies, mostly as a derivation of mathematics. For example, from age 10 to age 20, a child transitioning to adulthood has lived a “lifetime” to get there. However, from age 20 to age 30, we’re talking half a lifetime (relative to the 10-year-old child’s perspective). As you jump from decade to decade, time from a perceptional view “accelerates” if you will.The point of the above paragraph is to emphasize that you shouldn’t waste time. Therefore, you want to stock up on retirement stocks to buy as early as possible. Below are several compelling ideas to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlbemarle (ALB)retirement stocks an older couple sitting on a dock and looking at a pamphletSource: ShutterstockWhile electric vehicles may represent the future of personal mobility and transportation, as an idea for the best retirement stocks in July, the narrative becomes quite tricky. At the end of the day, it’s anyone’s guess which EV brand will dominate over the next several decades. A much safer idea (relatively speaking) is Albemarle (NYSE:ALB). As a specialty chemicals manufacturing firm, its focus on lithium for the EV sector should be relevant indefinitely.To be fair, ALB isn’t the most exciting idea for retirement stocks to buy. Then again, this space isn’t built for excitement but rather for predictable and steady gains over time. I genuinely believe that’s the situation with Albemarle. By pretty much all accounts, both industry leaders and policymakers will push for broader EV integration. That’s only going to make ALB rise in pertinence.Currently, the company only features a forward yield of 0.7%, which is really nothing. However, the underlying EV market and its overall stout financials make ALB one of the top retirement stocks for July.Story continuesMcDonald’s (MCD)a financial planner showing a couple a piece of paperSource: ShutterstockA fixture in the American fast-food industry, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) at first glance might seem a risky proposition for best retirement stocks in July. While the Golden Arches may be iconic, the “problem” is that younger consumers tend to focus on healthier eating. Now, one would have to stretch credulity to characterize anything associated with McDonald’s as healthy. Still, MCD has a key element working in its favor.Specifically, social normalization trends should augur well for the fast-food giant. Based on an Axios report, companies have aggressively pushed for at least hybrid schedules for their employees. That means you’re going to see increased demand for breakfast products as worker bees attempt to make their commute more tolerable. Also, McDonald’s offers an excellent alternative for fancy (read overpriced) coffeeshop beverages.Presently, MCD carries a forward yield of 2.06%. Though it’s not particularly generous, it’s higher than the consumer discretionary sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Thus, it’s a solid idea for investing in retirement stocks.Bunge (BG)retirement stocks: miniature figurines climb a staircase made of coinsSource: ShutterstockAn American agribusiness and food company, Bunge (NYSE:BG) makes an excellent case for the best retirement stocks in July. Mostly, that’s because Bunge aligns with the traditional approach to planning for the future: acquiring income-providing enterprises that feature relevant, predictable businesses. Aside from rare geopolitical flashpoints, the agricultural industry is generally predictable because of its critical nature.Obviously, humans need sustenance to survive and thrive. Further, BG makes a particularly strong case for high-potential retirement stocks because of its value proposition. Due in part to disruptions to global agricultural and food-related commodities, the underlying sector has underperformed. However, this circumstance also sees BG being undervalued relative to forward earnings.Featuring solid revenue growth and consistent profitability, BG seems a worthwhile candidate for (relatively) mild speculation. Better yet, the company carries a forward yield of 2.7%, above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, its payout ratio sits at 23.14%, indicating high confidence in yield sustainability.Sempra Energy (SRE)an elderly couple jumping up in a white household. Cheap retirement stocksSource: ShutterstockIn real estate, it’s all about location, location, location. And one could make the same argument for public utilities, which is why I peg Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) as one of the best retirement stocks in July. While it’s not exactly a favorite enterprise among its users, here’s the reality: Sempra covers much of the lucrative Southern California market. Since the Golden State is the U.S. economic engine, folks here can pay their bills.Now, I don’t want to get bogged down with the discussion that clearly, not everybody lives the good life in Cali. However, people here generally tend to be educated, work high-paying jobs, or are otherwise go-getters. Naturally, such a framework serves the utility provider well. Like other companies in its ecosystem, Sempra doesn’t have sterling financial metrics. But it’s consistently profitable as you might expect.Also, what makes it a great candidate for retirement stocks to buy is its passive income. Carrying a forward yield of 3.3%, the payout ratio sits at a decent 49.71%. Also, Sempra enjoys 19 years of consecutive dividend increases.Phillips 66 (PSX)Coins stacked next to a calculator that says ""retirement plan."" Retirement stocks.Source: kenary820 / ShutterstockAt first glance, the inclusion of Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) among the best retirement stocks in July appears to clash with Albemarle. After all, Phillips 66 represents a downstream hydrocarbon energy giant. In contrast, the political and ideological winds favor EV integration, not building combustion-powered cars. So, what gives?Well, I’ve got to be real with you all – I don’t see combustion cars fading out altogether. Sure, EVs may become a much more prominent fixture on our roadways. However, sparking a majority transition to EVs will almost surely require a power infrastructure overhaul. We already have enough problems with air conditioners running during a heat wave, let alone charging full-sized vehicles. Therefore, Phillips 66 should be surprisingly relevant for years to come.Notably, because of the aggressively hawkish monetary policy, the underlying sector has underperformed. Subsequently, the market prices PSX at a forward multiple of 7.2, which is undervalued. For passive income, the company features a forward yield of 4.4%. As well, its payout ratio sits at 35.74%, providing confidence regarding yield sustainability.IBM (IBM)A pink piggy bank sits on top of piles of cash to represent cash-rich stocksSource: ShutterstockPerhaps a more classic idea for best retirement stocks in July, legacy technology giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) offers myriad relevancies. Sure, that wasn’t always the case. Years ago, “Big Blue” held on too strongly to its legacy business units. However, that was then and this is now. Today’s IBM focuses on contemporary and pertinent innovations such as the hybrid cloud network.Moving forward, what I appreciate about IBM as one of the top retirement stocks for July is that it provides core competencies without ego and fanfare. DO you want artificial intelligence? IBM has more than proven itself with IBM Watson and other enterprise-level digital intelligence solutions. How about cybersecurity for corporate clients? Or the blockchain? Whatever tech you can think of, Big Blue has you covered.What investors of high-potential retirement stocks will really appreciate is the passive income. Currently, the tech juggernaut carries a forward yield of 5.02%. While its payout ratio stands a bit on the high side at 66.53%, the company also features 30 years of consecutive dividend increases. That’s a status management that won’t give up cheaply.International Paper (IP)a man sitting behind a pile of cashSource: ShutterstockAnother classic idea for the best retirement stocks in July, International Paper (NYSE:IP) is boring. Maybe a little bit too boring, which may then raise some alarm bells for investors. Should they pile into an “analog” enterprise when the world is rapidly moving toward advanced digitalization? On paper (no pun intended), IP seems to contradict the bullish thesis for IBM.However, much like the situation with EVs and the mobility paradigm, I don’t see digitization efforts completely eliminating paper from the personal and business ecosystem. At the most cynical level, paper can’t be hacked into, offering a viable backup. Moreover, the rise and dominance of e-commerce will ironically boost the paper and packaging market. Thus, IP should be surprisingly relevant.Also, it’s difficult to overlook passive income if you’re investing in retirement stocks. At the time of writing, International Paper commands a forward yield of 5.91%. In fairness, the payout ratio of 81.34% is elevated. However, if you’re seeking a little spice and contrarianism in your long-term portfolio, IP may be enticing.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Valero Energy's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Valero Energy How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Valero Energy is:52% = US$14b ÷ US$27b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.52.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Valero Energy's Earnings Growth And 52% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Valero Energy has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 32% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, Valero Energy's considerable five year net income growth of 27% was to be expected.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Valero Energy's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 22% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is VLO fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Valero Energy Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Valero Energy has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 13%, meaning that it has the remaining 87% left over to reinvest into its business. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Moreover, Valero Energy is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 42% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 14% over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Valero Energy's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

Reported EPS is $5.57 EPS, expectations were $6.01.Operator: Good morning and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group’s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earning reports section of the company’s Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 14, 2023, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company’s website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.Andrew Witty: Thank you, and good morning. And thank you all for joining us. As we discussed a number of weeks ago during the quarter, we saw a somewhat higher than usual range of movement in certain areas of care activity. As you'd expect, this inevitably impacted some elements of our business, but we overcame these dynamics with strength in other areas. Our second quarter performance reflects the capabilities, agility, and dedication of our people as they responded to the changes. As a team, we're confident in our ability to robustly grow in this fluid healthcare environment. Indeed, as I hope you saw in our release today, revenue growth in the quarter was strong and well balanced across our enterprise increasing by more than $12 billion to nearly $93 billion.Story continuesLet me provide a few highlights of our growth. First, the number of patients served by OptumHealth under fully accountable value-based care arrangements grew by more than 900,000 over this time last year. Among the new patients we welcomed, a significant number have complex needs. These people have serious health challenges, limited economic resources and often living communities where it can be difficult to access high quality care. Our ability to support their needs is distinctive and a direct result of the investments we have made to provide coordinated and comprehensive medical, pharmacy, and behavioral care, foundational capabilities that will help the patients we serve live healthier lives and drive growth far into the future. OptumRx and OptumInsight revenue grew double-digits on expanded capabilities and products that are generating new sales and opportunities.UnitedHealthcare’s growth was strong and diversified as well. Today, we're serving nearly 1.6 million more people in our commercial and public sector program offerings than we did last year. This durable growth driven by our colleagues relentless focus on quality and execution enabled us to achieve second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.14 and to strengthen our full-year outlook to between $24.70 to $25 per share. We know there is great interest in understanding the recent care activity I just mentioned. So I'll give you an overview of how we're seeing care plans progress and how we're responding. I do want to underscore the most critical point first: making high quality care more affordable and accessible is at the core of our mission.Having more people obtaining the care they need is a positive trend for individuals and our health system and society. As we discussed several weeks ago, during the second quarter, we observed increased care patents, notably in outpatient surgeries for seniors and especially with certain orthopedic procedures, which may have been postponed. John will provide some additional detail on this later. As we look to 2024, we have developed compelling Medicare Advantage offerings. Our teams were, of course, thoughtful, both in our response to the CMS rate notice and in incorporating these care activity trends into our June benefit filings. Even in this challenging funding environment, we continue to prioritize the stability and affordability our members have come to rely on from UnitedHealthcare.We're confident that next year we will once again grow at a pace exceeding that of the broader market. While of a much lesser impact than senior outpatient care, we also are seeing increased care activity in behavioral. Over the past few years, behavioral care patterns have been accelerating as people increasingly feel comfortable seeking services. Just since last year, the percentage of people who are accessing behavioral care has increased by double-digits. From our perspective it’s an encouraging sign that more people are seeking help. Yet the ongoing shortage of qualified care providers has caused significant access challenges. To address the issue, OptumHealth has expanded its network by 10s of 1,000s of care professionals this year.And we are developing our benefit offerings, assuming demand for behavioral care services will continue to rise. OptumHealth’s value-based care models are continuing to deliver a specially strong and measurable results for people. Today serving more than 4 million patients and dozens of payers. OptumHealth and the patients and payers it serves share a common desire to seek improved health outcomes and experiences, while ultimately lowering the cost of care. And we're pleased to see more evidence supporting the efficacy of value-based care. Last month, researchers at Yale Medicine working in collaboration with Optum published a peer reviewed study about in-home visits, an important element in our value-based care approach. The study found patients who received our in-home preventative wellness assessments, compared with those who hadn't made fewer emergency department visits and spent fewer nights in hospitals across four common conditions: depression, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and Type 2 diabetes.They also experienced reduced wait times for follow-up primary Care. Yale Medicine’s research follows another peer reviewed study published in JAMA in December, which found Medicare Advantage patients in Optum's fully accountable care model showed significantly better health outcomes, compared to people in Medicare fee for service. OptumHealth patients fared better on each of eight key metrics: including hospital readmissions and emergency department visits. We see these results as compelling validation of the value-based care approach and signal more strongly its promise and potential, as we expand these care models to many millions more patients in the years ahead. I'll now turn it over to UnitedHealth Group, President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon, to elaborate on how we're focusing on affordability, transparency, and simplicity for the people we serve.Dirk?Pixabay/Public DomainDirk McMahon: Thanks Andrew. Making high quality care, more affordable and more accessible is what we do. So it is really great to see people getting the care they need, especially as our teams are working to build more capacity and our benefit networks and care delivery resources to accommodate consumers' evolving needs. Affordability is vital. For far too many people, cost remains the most significant barrier to high quality care. We are leaning in hard on behalf of consumers, employers, and health plans to lower out of pocket costs and drive greater affordability throughout the system. As you heard from Andrew, recently we've seen an uptick in outpatient surgeries. Finding the most appropriate site of service is crucial, because the cost of those procedures can differ dramatically depending upon where they are performed.Overall, evidence shows that comparable procedures performed in ambulatory surgery centers cost about half as much as traditional settings with comparable outcomes. For consumers, that translates into many 100 of dollars in out of pocket cost savings for just a single procedure. And the patient satisfaction levels at our centers are among the highest in healthcare with NPS approaching 90. Also high on our affordability agenda is continuing to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Our customers including employers, unions, health plans and governments count on us to help them access the most effective medicines at the lowest possible cost. In fact, pharmacy benefit managers like ours are the only link in the drug supply chain whose main purpose is to improve affordability for everyone.We go further by recommending benefit designs and providing tools to help consumers navigate their options and find the best value for their prescription. A recently launched feature called Price Edge, which provides the lowest cost option for a patient's medication. Already has delivered millions of dollars in customer out of pocket savings. Especially drug cost continue to be a focus of every customer OptumRx works with. Our differentiated approach to specialty is designed to serve the unique needs of patients, payers, providers, and pharma partners and has allowed us to greatly expand our access to limited distribution drugs. We work to tailor our programs with individualized single point of contact care for rare disease and clinical excellence programs for conditions such as MS, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.Clients working with OptumRx, who implement all our specialty medication management programs can save up to 20% on the specialty drug cost. Most related to specialty biosimilars are another area where we are helping drive affordability and consumer choice. Earlier this year, we began offering Amjevita, a biosimilar to Humira at parity ensuring patients and their doctors have more options to choose from when deciding on a course of care. Recently OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare announced the addition of two new Humira biosimilars, Cyltezo and Hyrimoz to our standard prescription drug list also at parry. This increased competition for the innovator drug will result in double-digit savings for our customers. You might also recall that a year ago, we announced our initiative to offer lifesaving drugs at no cost to our customers.This benefit is available to everyone in UnitedHealthcare's Group fully insured commercial plans and has been adopted by more than 500 of our self-funded customers, increasing adherence, and saving people millions of dollars. Finally, another important customer innovation that is making the health system simpler is Optum Financial’s integrated card, which enables seamless access to benefits, programs, and rewards for more than 13 million consumers, who have been issued the card since we broadly rolled it out at the start of the year. Adoption and satisfaction levels have been very strong, make it much simpler for seniors to navigate the system and understand their benefits and creating a more satisfying consumer experience. These and many other results are validating our strategic approach to healthcare.I know from my many meetings with customers that these affordability, transparency, and simplicity initiatives are resonating. They are a key reason for our continued growth in a highly competitive environment and for our confidence in maintaining our momentum as we look ahead. With that, let me hand it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.John Rex: Thank you, Dirk. Adaptability and delivering greater value for the people we serve continue as foundational elements for our enterprise. These last few months are a good example, identifying evolving market trends; moving quickly to help people get the care they need; incorporating our broad and multifaceted insights into planning and importantly delivering on our commitments to you, our shareholders. These traits underpin our confidence not only in achieving our goals for ‘23, but also as we look toward ‘24 and beyond. Before reviewing our business results, let me elaborate on the care patterns Andrew described earlier. To illustrate in the second quarter, outpatient care activity among seniors was a few 100 basis points above our expectations.As we've highlighted, specific orthopedic and cardiac procedures had increased its far above that level of variation. And as we developed and filed our 2024 Medicare Advantage offerings, we assume that these levels of heightened care activity will persist throughout next year. Overall care activity among our Medicaid and commercial populations is consistent with our expectations. As always, we continue to intensely analyze trends that may indicate more severe disease progression, which could point to rising acuity. For example, in areas such as cancer or cardiovascular disease, we see no such evidence, while continuing to monitor closely. With that, let's turn to out second quarter results. Revenue of $92.9 billion, grew by nearly $12.6 billion or 16% over the prior year with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare.OptumHealth revenues grew by 36% to $23.9 billion, driven by an increase in the number of patients served, a growing mix of patients with more complex needs and the expanding scope of care services we can offer. Operating margins reflect the higher care activity patterns we have discussed with seniors comprising a significant majority of value-based patients served. OptumRx revenues grew by 15%, surpassing $28 billion, driven by continued new customer wins and strong double-digit growth across our specialty, infusion, and community pharmacies. Script growth of nearly 7% reflects continued demand for our affordable solutions that give customers choice and simplify the pharmacy experience, such as biosimilar access and digital pharmacy tools.Part way into the ‘24 selling season, this momentum continues with strong client additions. OptumInsight revenues grew 42% to nearly $4.7 billion. The revenue backlog reached over $31 billion, an increase of $8 billion over last year, in part due to the addition of Change Healthcare. The integration and investment activities discussed on previous calls have gone well and are setting the stage for the next phase of growth for OptumInsight. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Our commercial business added nearly 500,000 people in the first-half and continues its growth with the ‘24 selling season indications tracking favorably. Within our public sector programs, we continue to expect growth of over 900,000 Medicare Advantage members this year. And our Medicaid performance remains strong, as we continue to support states as they initiate redeterminations.Comprehensive outreach efforts to help individuals retain coverage are underway though it is still early as most states began this work only recently. Our capital capacities are strong. Adjusted cash flows from operations were at $10.4 billion or nearly 2 times net income in the second quarter and $15.6 billion or nearly 1.4 times net income in the first-half. In the first six 6 months of this year, we returned $8.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and in June, our Board of Directors increased the dividend by 14%. As Andrew mentioned, based upon our growth outlook and the trends discussed, today we were able to strengthen and narrow our full-year ‘23 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.70 to $25 per share.Within this, we expect a relatively balanced pacing in the second-half. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.Andrew Witty: John, thank you. Overall, for UnitedHealth Group, looking to the second-half of the year and into 2024 and beyond. We're confident that we're capturing the current landscape in our planning decisions, which in turn gives us confidence in our ability to sustain the growth momentum shown in our first-half and continue to demonstrate the adaptability, performance, and mission-driven purpose of this enterprise, especially in evolving environments.

Horton's (NYSE:DHI) 27% CAGR outpaced the company's earnings growth over the same five-year period,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/d-r-hortons-nyse-dhi-110035335.html,1689505235,STORY,['DHI'],"[The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. Long term D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 206% in five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 31% gain in the last three months.Since it's been a strong week for D.R. Horton shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. See our latest analysis for D.R. Horton To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, D.R. Horton achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 38% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 25% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. The reasonably low P/E ratio of 8.58 also suggests market apprehension.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that D.R. Horton has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, D.R. Horton's TSR for the last 5 years was 225%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that D.R. Horton shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 79% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 27% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand D.R. Horton better, we need to consider many other factors.

Consumers have kept up spending on travel even with inflation high, and the industry is short thousands of pilots.ALPA represents about 14,000 pilots at the Chicago-based carrier. It said it reached an agreement in principle with United management, which includes substantial improvements to compensation, as well as advancements in quality of life, vacation, and other benefits.""We're pleased to have reached an agreement with ALPA,"" United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said. ""The four-year agreement, once ratified, will deliver a meaningful pay raise and quality of life improvements for our pilots while putting the airline on track to achieve the incredible potential of our United Next strategy,"" he added.The deal comes months after pilots at Delta Air Lines ratified a new contract that includes over $7 billion in cumulative increases in pay and benefits over four years.Industry officials say Delta's new contract has become a new benchmark for contract negotiations in North America. Rival American Airlines in May also reached a labor deal.United, Delta, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines are estimated to hire about 8,000 pilots this year.In the past two years, unions across the aerospace, construction, airline and rail industries have rebuffed initial offers from management, seeking higher wages in a tight labor market.United pilots turned down a deal last year that included more than 14.5% in cumulative wage increases and enhanced overtime and training pay.Analysts at Jefferies estimate the United States is short about 10,000 pilots.

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.34bUS$7.12bUS$7.14bUS$7.56bUS$7.88bUS$8.16bUS$8.42bUS$8.66bUS$8.89bUS$9.11bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.27%Est @ 3.63%Est @ 3.17%Est @ 2.85%Est @ 2.63%Est @ 2.47% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% US$5.8kUS$6.0kUS$5.6kUS$5.4kUS$5.2kUS$5.0kUS$4.7kUS$4.5kUS$4.3kUS$4.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$51bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.5%– 2.1%) = US$145bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$145b÷ ( 1 + 8.5%)10= US$64bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$114b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$211, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Union Pacific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.082. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Union PacificStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Transportation industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Transportation market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

(NYSE:AMP) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 84% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ameriprise-financial-inc-nyse-amp-110104622.html,1689505264,STORY,['AMP'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Ameriprise Financial's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 17 shareholders own 51% of the companyUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 84% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Ameriprise Financial. See our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Ameriprise Financial?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Ameriprise Financial. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Ameriprise Financial's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Ameriprise Financial is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 13% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.4% by the third-largest shareholder.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 17 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Ameriprise FinancialThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Ameriprise Financial, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$112m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Ameriprise Financial. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Ameriprise Financial  you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.
