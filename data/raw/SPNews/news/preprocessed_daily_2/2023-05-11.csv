0,3d65a0d7-361c-3294-a61f-00981907e632,SCHW,2023-05-11,Should Schwab U.S. Large-Cap ETF (SCHX) Be on Your Investing Radar?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-u-large-cap-etf-102010995.html,1683800410,STORY,"['SCHW', '^GSPC']","[Designed to provide broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market, the Schwab U.S. Large-Cap ETF (SCHX) is a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 11/03/2009.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $30.84 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.03%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.58%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 26.20% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 6.68% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN).The top 10 holdings account for about 25.61% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHX seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market measures all U.S. equity securities with readily available prices. The index includes approximately the largest 750 stocks and is float-adjusted market-capitalization weighted.Story continuesThe ETF return is roughly 8.22% so far this year and is up about 4.74% in the last one year (as of 05/11/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $42.25 and $51.01.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 19.14% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 760 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. Large-Cap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SCHX is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF has $309.46 billion in assets, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has $379.74 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

5,476b362d-3ea3-3f4e-ac79-a54f3a8a04ff,UNM,2023-05-11,Add These 5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks to Your Portfolio in May,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/add-5-low-price-book-111411179.html,1683803651,STORY,"['GM', 'DBK.DE', 'UNM', 'PVH']","[In value analysis, though price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) are most preferred by investors, the underrated price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with exceptional returns. The ratio is used to compare a stock’s market value/price to its book value.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market price per share/book value of equity per shareP/B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share. So, if the share price is $10 and book value of equity is $5, investors are ready to pay two times the book value.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Deutsche Bank DB, General Motors GM, Unum Group UNM, PVH Corp. PVH and Varex Imaging Corporation VREX are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.Deutsche Bank has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.

GM, Park Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. PK and PVH Corp. PVH.These 4 Low Price-to-Cash-Flow Stocks Have Winning PotentialValue style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock's inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company's financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Unum Group, General Motors Co., Park Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. and PVH Corp. boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company's earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company's liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company's liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesHowever, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are four of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Unum Group, which provides financial protection benefit solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 9.1% for three-five years. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 18.6%, on average.

GM, Park Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. PK and PVH Corp. PVH.These 4 Low Price-to-Cash-Flow Stocks Have Winning PotentialValue style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock's inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company's financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Unum Group, General Motors Co., Park Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. and PVH Corp. boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company's earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company's liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company's liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesHowever, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are four of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Unum Group, which provides financial protection benefit solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 9.1% for three-five years.

The figure increased 45% year over year.The screening revenue upside can be primarily attributed to broad-based momentum in Cologuard adoption with additional benefits from a relatively mild flu season and enhancements made last year to the company’s patient compliance program and billing systems.Exact Sciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseExact Sciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseExact Sciences Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Exact Sciences Corporation QuotePrecision Oncology revenues, including laboratory service revenues from global Oncotype products and therapy selection products, were $155 million, up 2% year over year. Growth was 8%, excluding the sale of the company’s prostate business and a $1 million foreign exchange headwind.Revenues from COVID-19 testing totaled $4 million, down 86% year over year.MarginIn the quarter under review, Exact Sciences’ gross profit (excluding the amortization of acquired intangibles) rose 26.6% to $445.6 million. The gross margin expanded 165 basis points (bps) to 73.9%.Research and development expenses declined 6.7% year over year to $95.4 million. Sales and marketing expenses fell 19.5% to $186.9 million. General and administrative expenses rose 27.9% year over year to $217.3 million.Adjusted operating expenses were $499.7 million in the first quarter, down 0.9% year over year. Adjusted operating loss totaled $54.1 million, narrower than the year-ago operating loss of $152.3 million.Story continuesFinancial UpdateExact Sciences exited the first quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $698.6 million compared with $632.1 million at the end of 2022.The company reported long-term debt of $50 million on its balance sheet at the end of Q1, unchanged from 2022 level.2023 ViewThe company raised its 2023 revenue guidance to the range of $2.380-$2.420 billion (from the earlier guidance of $2.265-$2.315 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $2.26 billion.For 2023, the company now expects its Screening revenues in the range of $1.770-$1.795 billion ($1.660-$1.690 billion). The company expects Precision Oncology revenues in the range of $605-$620 million ($600-$620 million). COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be $5 million (unchanged).Our TakeExact Sciences exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. The quarterly loss narrowed significantly from the year-ago period. Robust revenues from the Screening and Precision Oncology segments contributed to the first-quarter top line. During the quarter, 10,000 new healthcare professionals ordered Cologuard, bringing the total to over 312,000.The growing uptake of the company’s Oncotype DX Breast and therapy selection products are major advantages. The raised 2023 guidance is a major upside.However, the decline in COVID-19 sales hampered top-line growth. The company incurred an operating loss in the quarter under review, raising apprehension.Zacks Rank and Key PicksExact Sciences currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

For more countries, head on over to 5 Smallest Countries in the World That Matter the Most. In modern day geopolitics where everything boils down to resources, economic and military power, geographic size usually does not matter when it comes to international politics and influence. Take for instance the example of Africa. Africa is the world's second largest continent in terms of both its population and its area. However, Africa's gross domestic product (GDP) is a mere $2.96 trillion in nominal terms. Compare this GDP with that of New York City - the world's largest city in terms of economic output. New York's GMP (gross metropolitan product) sits at $2.01 trillion - more than two thirds of the entire African economy. In fact, New York's most prosperous district, Manhattan, had a GDP of $651 billion in 2020 - greater than the $376 billion GDP of Pakistan, the world's fifth most populous country according to data from the United Nations.So, as is clear from New York's example, size really doesn't matter in a lot of cases. Another example of this phenomenon comes from the corporate world. In terms of employees, one of the world's largest companies is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Walmart has a whopping 2.1 million employees working for it, and it earned $11.6 billion in profits during its fiscal year that ended in June 2023. However, one of the world's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), has a mere 164,000 employees working for it - less than one tenth of Walmart's workforce. Yet, despite this, Apple's profit during its fiscal year ending in September 2022 was $99 billion - almost nine times that of Walmart's. Of course, the different nature of the duo's business model requires Walmart to have more employees. It is after all primarily a retailer which needs more employees to run its stores. Yet, as is evident, a higher number of employees does not translate into higher profit gains for shareholders as these depend more on the product category and technology involved.Story continuesOn the flip side, being larger comes to Walmart's benefit when we consider its total revenues. The firm earned $611 billion in revenue during its latest fiscal year, more than $200 billion higher than Apple's latest fiscal year revenue of $394 billion.In the financial world too, size is a key factor. For instance, one of the largest investment holding companies in the world is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B). Berkshire does not operate in a way that a hedge fund does, i.e. the firm does not seek to rapidly trade shares to make a profit. Instead, it takes up stakes in firms that it believes will do well in the future and makes money from investments in sectors such as manufacturing and energy as well as through dividends. The firm had a whopping $948 billion in assets as of 2022 end, and its size ensures that when it buys shares, the entire market moves.As an example, Berkshire disclosed in mid November 2022 that it had bought a $4.1 billion stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) - the world's largest contract chip manufacturer. Prior to the announcement, TSMC's shares had taken a beating on the stock market, and the American Depository Receipts (ADRs) had dropped to $60 at the start of November. However, as soon as word broke of Berkshire's investment, the ADRs jumped from $74 on November 11 to $80.5 the day after the investment firm's SEC filings revealed the purchase. Currently, they are trading at $84.30, still higher than the November low and despite the fact that Mr. Buffett has since sold the shares as he is worried about the geopolitical risk in Taiwan and TSMC's inability to control it.Finally, while heft might sound comforting in times of trouble, it still ends up constraining one's ability to be agile. The clearest example of this phenomenon in the business world is the rise of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Tesla is the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and leads the market due to new manufacturing processes that it has developed on its own. However, despite their best efforts, America's largest conventional car manufacturers, namely General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), have yet to match Tesla's success in the market despite bringing in as much as three times in revenue as the firm.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some smallest countries in the world that matter the most.25 Smallest Countries In the World That Matter the MostOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the smallest countries that matter the most, we first listed down all countries except the top fifty in terms of landmass.

But that trend has recently reversed slightly, making them attractive prospects for large pharmacy benefit managers like Cigna's (CI) Express Scripts, as well as startup discount platforms like Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs.The number of independents has gradually grown by 8% over the past 10 years, even though for decades they lost market share to big retail outfits. Between 2022 and 2023, so far, 99 new independent pharmacies have opened, which translates to 0.4% growth, according to the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association.That gradual change in landscape is attracting the attention of both Express Scripts and Cost Plus. In addition, indie pharmacies can help fill the coverage hole left by big retail chains.Cuban's Cost Plus, a discount platform that partners with PBMs, is capitalizing on growth in the niche market with new benefit cards that will be accepted by more than three dozen independent pharmacies in Indiana, Texas and New Jersey, with a growing list daily, it says.In a tweet announcing the move, Cuban said the new benefit card will not be available for big retail pharmacies because ""they don't like us. We will be working with indie pharmacies, groceries and others.""Unlike other discount cards, the benefit card is a membership tied to individual patients. And unlike discount cards, which charge pharmacies a fee for filling the prescription using their discount, Cost Plus will pay the pharmacies $8 — equivalent to the charge of labor of shipping if a patient orders from its website, according to the company.CEO Alex Oshmyansky said the goal is to cut out the middlemen and their fees by directly negotiating with manufacturers and passing on the savings. By doing so, ""We can decrease the cost to patients while making independent pharmacies....more sustainable as a business in the long term,"" he told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview.Story continues""It's always been in our plan to try and support the local pharmacists who are really in their community, who know their patients,"" Oshmyansky said. He added that big pharmacy managers, which set the drug prices, are often owned by the drug store chains like CVS. Thus, they have squeezed profits for independent pharmacies.""I think these entities are just addicted to these absurd profit margins, from these ultra-high-cost generic products, and are unwilling to bring them down,"" Oshmyansky said.Cost Plus is largely playing in the generics market, where other discounters like Walmart (WMT) and GoodRx (GDRX) have been for some time—and where there is significant competition for lower prices. Online pharmacies or mail-order platforms are also increasingly competitive for generics, including with Amazon (AMZN) now in the mix.All of this has added to the competition that independent pharmacies have faced in recent years.Meanwhile, Cigna's PBM, Express Scripts, announced a strategy that would increase reimbursements to independent pharmacies that fill prescriptions for its members, plus a longer-term strategy to increase the importance of these pharmacies in the communities they serve.Mark Cuban: Offering a lifeline to indie pharmacies? (Photo by Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports) (USA TODAY USPW / reuters)One for Express Scripts, according to president Adam Kautzner, is to ensure that underserved populations in both rural and urban areas finally get the attention they've been missing.Lack of access Underserved populations vary from rural areas to pockets that lack access in urban areas.The access gap has been amplified in recent years: Large retail chains like CVS, Walgreens (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) have announced that they have, or will be, closing locations. This year, CVS said it would shutter 900 outlets, but didn't specify where. (Rite Aid said it would open mini locations to serve rural areas.)A University of Southern California study shows that ""as of 2020, pharmacies in Black and Latino neighborhoods were more likely to close and less likely to offer immunizations, 24-hour, and drive-through services than pharmacies in other neighborhoods,"" according to the study's authors.The Cost Plus focus on these vulnerable populations can help independent pharmacies in these markets. The company recently announced a partnership with Zócalo Health, a telehealth platform that provides care for cash for underinsured and uninsured individuals in the LatinX market community, according to CEO Erik Cardenas. The National Hispanic Medical Association has told Congress that Latinos are more likely to be uninsured.It's why Zócalo teamed up with Cost Plus. The care providers at Zócalo can help ensure and track the fulfillment of prescription needs of patients, and answer questions about medications as needed.And the benefit goes both ways. The more independent pharmacies do business, the more drug manufacturers and insurers will too. Which is also why the additional screening and testing services, which could create more prescription volume, is part of the strategy.""By continuing to have accessibility to independent pharmacies, to keep them strong and to be able to continue to grow their own businesses, patients will be able to and get new prescriptions, refill their prescriptions, and stay adherent (to current prescriptions),"" Express Scripts' Kautzner said.More than drugs""I'm a pharmacist from rural America. So this area is also top of mind to me, of the role independent pharmacists play,"" Kautzner said.That's why he's spearheading the effort that will provide greater reimbursements for prescriptions for rural pharmacies that are within a 10-mile radius of an Express Scripts member.Express Scripts will also help boost the services such as common medical screenings and vaccinations.The company, meanwhile, is also convening a new advisory committee focused on independent pharmacies. That committee will also be instrumental in coordinating with state and federal government bodies to ensure these independent pharmacists are able to succeed. Kautzner said that in rural areas, which serve about 20% of the U.S. population, pharmacists sometimes are the only medical professional a person has access to as physicians are in short supply. ""So this is a way for them to expand the level of services that they can provide.""Kautzner said Express Scripts decided to launch the strategy after studying the independent pharmacy space last year and coming to the conclusion that there are more pharmacies opening up in some areas. He added: ""That's definitely encouraging, post-pandemic, that we are starting to see some of them continue to thrive and expand.""Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -75%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this portfolio of online fashion brands would post earnings of $0.02 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.03, delivering a surprise of -250%.Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.a.k.a. Brands , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, posted revenues of $120.49 million for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.40%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $148.32 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.A.k.a.

Brands has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for a.k.a. Brands: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

However, with the gradual reopening of economies and the restoration of consumer confidence, the industry is making a comeback and regaining some lost ground. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NCLH), one of the key players, stands out in this industry as it capitalizes on the post-pandemic recovery due to several key factors.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NCLH. Click here to check it out. NCLH 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NCLHPeter Lynch Chart of NCLHNorwegian Cruise enjoys strong brand recognition and a devoted customer base; two factors that are helping it gain momentum as the demand for cruise travel increases. Furthermore, the company's innovative product offerings and adaptable financial strategy further bolster its position. With a fleet of 30 ships that traverse over 500 destinations globally, the company is one of the largest cruise line operators in the world.What sets Norwegian Cruise apart from the competition is its unique ""freestyle cruising"" concept, enabling guests to tailor their vacations by providing an extensive range of choices in dining, entertainment and activities. This emphasis on customization and flexibility appeals to both new and repeat customers seeking personalized experiences. The company's recovery strategy is proving to be successful, as evidenced by its first-quarter financial results that surpassed expectations across all key metrics.Improving numbersOn May 1, the company's first-quarter 2023 results showcased its resilience and adaptability. Norwegian Cruise Line surpassed analysts' expectations with a lower-than-expected net loss and higher-than-expected revenue. Revenue of $1.82 billion marked a 249% year-over-year increase, driven by a full restart of operations after the challenging period of suspended voyages from 2020 through May of 2022. The company reported a net loss of $159.30 million, an improvement of more than 84% from the previous year.Story continuesOne of the key factors contributing to Norwegians recent success is its phased occupancy ramp-up strategy, which achieved a 15-point sequential improvement to approximately 101.5% in the first quarter. This surpassed the guidance of approximately 100%, reflecting the company's commitment to delivering exceptional guest experiences. Furthermore, the initiative is expected to be completed in the second quarter at approximately 105%, demonstrating the company's strategic shift toward longer, more immersive itineraries.The strong consumer demand is also evident in the companys cumulative booked position for the remainder of 2023, which is ahead of 2019 levels. Despite only an 18% increase in capacity, the booked position continues to show promising growth, accompanied by higher pricing. As of March 31, the company achieved a record advance ticket sales balance of $3.4 billion, representing a significant increase of approximately 26% compared to the previous quarter and around 60% compared to the first quarter of 2019.Norwegian Cruise also continues to focus on enhancing onboard revenue generation and increasing pre-sold revenue from guests prior to sailing. This approach has proven effective in driving higher overall spending throughout the cruise journey, bolstering the company's financial performance. As a result, total revenue per passenger cruise day exhibited a notable increase of approximately 18.3% in constant currency during the quarter compared to 2019.The companys dedication to enhancing liquidity and financial flexibility remains unwavering. As of March 31, the company's total debt stood at $13.1 billion, while its liquidity reached approximately $1.9 billion. This includes $701 million in cash and cash equivalents, nearly $600 million available under its revolving loan facility and a $650 million undrawn commitment. The company is also set to benefit from an additional unsecured and undrawn commitment of $300 million, which will enhance future liquidity. Further, the companys proactive measures to optimize its balance sheet and reduce leverage include increasing export credit agency-backed commitments by approximately 1.7 billion euros ($1.86 billion) in April. These additional funds will be utilized to finance improvements, changes and modifications to certain newbuilds, reinforcing the companys commitment to enhancing its offerings and ensuring an exceptional guest experience.Additionally, the company's ongoing margin enhancement initiative has started to yield positive results, as evidenced by the significant sequential improvement in operating costs during the first quarter. Gross cruise costs per capacity day decreased to approximately $301 in constant currency, compared to $323 in the second half of 2022. Moreover, adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day in constant currency, improved to approximately $161 compared to $187 in the second half of 2022, which was better than the guidance of $165. These cost savings from the margin enhancement initiative were realized earlier than anticipated.Norwegian Cruise is also awaiting its return to sailing in Asia with its newly revitalized Norwegian Jewel set to make a grand entrance to Tokyo on Oct. 19 after more than three years. The company believes Asia is a key market today and that adventure-loving guests will book Asia-bound cruises later this year.During Norwegian Jewel's extensive six-month Asia season, it will offer 16 immersive itineraries visiting 11 countries and sailing from nine different departure ports. These ports include Tokyo, Yokohama, Taipei, Bangkok, Bali and Kuala Lumpur. The itineraries range from 10 to 14 days, allowing travelers to explore various destinations at their own pace.The companys focus on destination immersion ensures guests will have the opportunity to experience the wonders of trending destinations like Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia. The itineraries also provide flexibility, allowing passengers to combine their cruise with land tours. Moreover, there will be fewer sea days, longer stays in ports and more overnight stays, giving guests ample time to explore and enjoy the vibrant cities and cultures of Asia.With the industry's recovery underway, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is confident in its ability to navigate the post-pandemic landscape successfully. By focusing on enhancing its offerings, fortifying its financial position and prioritizing guest satisfaction, the company aims to establish a solid foundation for sustained and profitable growth in the long run.TakeawayWith impressive passenger revenues, rising occupancy rates and a reduction in operating costs, Norwegian Cruise Line is well-positioned to capitalize on the anticipated rebound in demand for cruise vacations. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 17, the stock is not too expensively valued, presenting a good opportunity for value investors to consider before the company's improving financials push the share price higher.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Chinese buyers stepped in to snap up discounted crude oil, coal and aluminium, boosting 2022 commodities imports from Moscow by 52% in value terms.Story continuesThat helped save China billions of dollars as its economy reeled from COVID lockdowns, with purchases poised to grow this year as China's economy recovers.Total settlements on Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), China's alternative to the SWIFT international payment system, rose 21.5% year-on-year to 96.7 trillion yuan ($14.02 trillion) in 2022, Chinese central bank data showed.Nearly all of China's oil imports from Russia, mostly crude but also smaller volumes of fuel oil, are now settled in yuan, five trading executives with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. China imported a combined $60.3 billion worth of crude oil and fuel oil from Russia last year, according to Chinese customs.None of the executives wanted to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.The People's Bank of China did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Globally, yuan use has been gaining momentum.

Higher interest rates can weigh on oil demand by boosting borrowing costs, pressuring economic growth.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged Congress to raise the $31.4 trillion federal debt limit and avert an unprecedented default that would trigger a global economic downturn.""Uncertainties regarding the U.S. debt ceiling, recent banking issues that could prompt a credit crunch across much of the oil industry and continued strong possibility of a recession remain ... significant obstacles"" for oil markets, analysts at energy consulting firm Ritterbusch and Associates said in a note.Keeping pressure on oil prices, the U.S. Dow and S&amp;P 500 stock indexes fell after California-based bank PacWest Bancorp's latest woes sparked another rout in the regional banking sector.An extended period of high interest rates could put more stress on banks, but would be necessary if inflation stays stubbornly high, said Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari.U.S. producer prices rose moderately last month, the smallest annual producer inflation increase in more than two years.In other U.S. news, President Joe Biden's administration unveiled a sweeping plan to slash greenhouse gas emissions from the power industry, one of the biggest steps so far in its effort to decarbonize the economy to fight climate change.Story continuesNew Chinese bank loans tumbled far more sharply than expected in April, adding to worries that the economy's post-pandemic recovery is losing steam.""Oil prices are lower after another round of Chinese data, this time money metrics, confirmed their economic reopening from COVID continues to disappoint,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at data and analytics firm OANDA.The oil market largely ignored the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) global oil demand forecast for 2023, which projected demand in China, the world's biggest oil importer, would increase.OPEC projected Chinese oil demand would rise by 800,000 barrels per day (bpd), up from its 760,000-bpd forecast last month.OPEC, however, said that increase in Chinese demand could be offset by economic risks elsewhere, including the U.S. debt ceiling battle.On the supply front, Iraq has sent an official request to Turkey to restart oil exports through a pipeline running from the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region in northern Iraq to the Turkish port of Ceyhan, which could add 450,000 bpd to global crude flows.(Additional reporting by Shadia Nasralla in London and Jeslyn Lerh in Singapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy, David Gregorio and Cynthia Osterman)]"

(NYSE: FE) is encouraging Maryland customers of its subsidiary Potomac Edison to evaluate electric supply offers from competitive suppliers that fit their budget and protect against rising energy prices this summer. Due to the results of recent competitive auctions, Potomac Edison customers in Maryland who rely on the company for all aspects of service will see an increase in the price they pay for electric generation beginning June 1.Potomac Edison Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)Customer bills are divided into two parts: a charge from Potomac Edison for delivering electricity to a home or business, and a separate charge for the actual electricity used by a customer. For the second component, customers can shop and choose a competitive energy supplier who may be able to offer a lower price for generation.The electric company is required to purchase electricity through a competitive auction process for customers who do not choose an energy supplier. ""Non-shopping"" customers pay an Energy Supply Charge, which is one of the components included in the Standard Offer Service (SOS) rate listed on their monthly bills. Effective June 1, the Energy Supply Charge rate included in the SOS for Potomac Edison's non-shopping residential customers in Maryland will be 8.514 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) through Sept. 30, 2023.A typical non-shopping residential customer using 1,000 kWh per month is expected to see their total bill increase by about 23% from May to June. The prices, which update annually on June 1, are seasonal, with summer pricing in effect for the months of June through Sept., and non-summer pricing in effect for all other months. Non-summer prices are expected to remain higher than those seen this past winter.""With energy rates elevated as we head into the hot, summer months, now is a great time to review your options so that you can select a rate or program that works best for you and your family,"" said Mark Jones, vice president of customer engagement for FirstEnergy.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for PG&amp;E How Fast Is PG&amp;E Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Strong earnings per share (EPS) results are an indicator of a company achieving solid profits, which investors look upon favourably and so the share price tends to reflect great EPS performance. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. Commendations have to be given in seeing that PG&amp;E grew its EPS from US$0.13 to US$0.95, in one short year. Even though that growth rate may not be repeated, that looks like a breakout improvement.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It was a year of stability for PG&amp;E as both revenue and EBIT margins remained have been flat over the past year. That's not a major concern but nor does it point to the long term growth we like to see.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for PG&amp;E's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre PG&amp;E Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$34b company like PG&amp;E. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. To be specific, they have US$44m worth of shares. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. While their ownership only accounts for 0.1%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.Should You Add PG&amp;E To Your Watchlist?PG&amp;E's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering PG&amp;E for a spot on your watchlist. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 2 warning signs for PG&amp;E (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of.Although PG&amp;E certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Marathon Oil's shares before the 16th of May to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.10 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.40 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Marathon Oil has a trailing yield of 1.8% on the current share price of $22.67. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Marathon Oil can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Oil Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Marathon Oil has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 9.0% of its income after tax. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Luckily it paid out just 6.5% of its free cash flow last year.It's positive to see that Marathon Oil's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. It's encouraging to see Marathon Oil has grown its earnings rapidly, up 44% a year for the past five years. With earnings per share growing rapidly and the company sensibly reinvesting almost all of its profits within the business, Marathon Oil looks like a promising growth company.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Marathon Oil has seen its dividend decline 5.2% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see. Marathon Oil is a rare case where dividends have been decreasing at the same time as earnings per share have been improving. It's unusual to see, and could point to unstable conditions in the core business, or more rarely an intensified focus on reinvesting profits.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Marathon Oil? Marathon Oil has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past 10 years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.While it's tempting to invest in Marathon Oil for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. To that end, you should learn about the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Marathon Oil (including 1 which is a bit concerning).A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

The outperformance reflects higher domestic oil and gas production.However, the company’s bottom line fell from the year-ago adjusted profit of $1.02 due to weaker oil realizations in the United States and higher overall costs.The company reported revenues of $1.7 billion, which came 4.4% above the consensus mark but fell 4.2% from the year-ago sales of $1.8 billion.In good news for investors, the company is using the excess cash from a supportive environment to reward them with dividends and buybacks. As part of that, MRO executed $334 million in share repurchases in the first quarter.Marathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Oil Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Marathon Oil Corporation Quote Segmental PerformanceThis Texas-based energy explorer’s total net production (from U.S. and International units) in the quarter under review came in at 396,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared to 345,000 BOE/d in the year-ago period.U.S. E&amp;P: This U.S. upstream unit reported an income of $425 million, down from $661 million in the year-ago period due to lower oil realizations and higher costs, partly offset by stronger production.Marathon Oil’s average realized liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $74.69 per barrel were lower than the year-earlier level of $94.43. Additionally, natural gas liquids average price realizations decreased 35% to $24.27 a barrel. Finally, average realized natural gas prices plunged 38.4% year over year to $2.95 per thousand cubic feet.Meanwhile, production costs were $5.82 per BOE, representing a 4.1% year-over-year rise.Net production of 341,000 BOE/d was up 21.4% from first-quarter 2022. Total U.S. output comprised approximately 52% oil, or 176,000 barrels per day (bpd).Significantly higher year-over-year production from Eagle Ford favorably affected the company’s quarterly performance, which was partly offset by lower volumes from the Bakken area. The Eagle Ford region recorded an average production of 144,000 BOE/d, surging 80% from the level in first-quarter 2022, while output from Bakken was 94,000 BOE/d compared with 118,000 BOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, Oklahoma output came in at 54,000 BOE/d, up from the year-ago level of 52,000 BOE/d.International E&amp;P: The segment, which explores and produces oil and gas in Equatorial Guinea, reported earnings of $89 million compared with $115 million in the year-ago period due to lower output.Marathon reported production available for sale of 55,000 BOE/d, down from 64,000 Boe/d in first-quarter 2022.Marathon’s average realized liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $58.57 per barrel reflected a 1.8% deterioration from the year-earlier quarter. Natural gas and natural gas liquids’ average price realizations came in at 24 cents per thousand cubic feet and $1 a barrel, respectively, the same as the corresponding period of 2022.Story continuesFinancial PositionTotal costs in the quarter were $1.1 billion, $127 million higher than the prior-year period. Marathon Oil reported an adjusted operating cash flow of $942 million for the first quarter, down 26.4% from a year ago.As of Mar 31, 2023, it had cash and cash equivalents worth $178 million and long-term debt of 5.7 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio of the company was 33.4.Marathon Oil spent $601 million in capital and exploratory expenditures during the quarter and raked in $309 million in adjusted free cash flow.2023 GuidanceMarathon has maintained its budgeted capital spending between $1.9 billion and $2 billion this year. Meanwhile, MRO continues to prioritize shareholder returns over production growth. The company is targeting production in the range of 385,000 BOE/d to 405,000 BOE/d, up more than 15% (at the midpoint) from last year. Further, Marathon expects oil volumes in the band of 185,000-195,000 barrels per day. Assuming $80 WTI, Marathon Oil expects to return a minimum of 40% of its cash flow from operations.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMarathon — a leading upstream oil and gas company — carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.          Meanwhile, investors interested in the energy sector might consider operators like Weatherford International WFRD, Riley Exploration Permian REPX and Sunoco LP SUN.

But that trend has recently reversed slightly, making them attractive prospects for large pharmacy benefit managers like Cigna's (CI) Express Scripts, as well as startup discount platforms like Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs.The number of independents has gradually grown by 8% over the past 10 years, even though for decades they lost market share to big retail outfits. Between 2022 and 2023, so far, 99 new independent pharmacies have opened, which translates to 0.4% growth, according to the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association.That gradual change in landscape is attracting the attention of both Express Scripts and Cost Plus. In addition, indie pharmacies can help fill the coverage hole left by big retail chains.Cuban's Cost Plus, a discount platform that partners with PBMs, is capitalizing on growth in the niche market with new benefit cards that will be accepted by more than three dozen independent pharmacies in Indiana, Texas and New Jersey, with a growing list daily, it says.In a tweet announcing the move, Cuban said the new benefit card will not be available for big retail pharmacies because ""they don't like us. We will be working with indie pharmacies, groceries and others.""Unlike other discount cards, the benefit card is a membership tied to individual patients. And unlike discount cards, which charge pharmacies a fee for filling the prescription using their discount, Cost Plus will pay the pharmacies $8 — equivalent to the charge of labor of shipping if a patient orders from its website, according to the company.CEO Alex Oshmyansky said the goal is to cut out the middlemen and their fees by directly negotiating with manufacturers and passing on the savings. By doing so, ""We can decrease the cost to patients while making independent pharmacies....more sustainable as a business in the long term,"" he told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview.Story continues""It's always been in our plan to try and support the local pharmacists who are really in their community, who know their patients,"" Oshmyansky said. He added that big pharmacy managers, which set the drug prices, are often owned by the drug store chains like CVS. Thus, they have squeezed profits for independent pharmacies.""I think these entities are just addicted to these absurd profit margins, from these ultra-high-cost generic products, and are unwilling to bring them down,"" Oshmyansky said.Cost Plus is largely playing in the generics market, where other discounters like Walmart (WMT) and GoodRx (GDRX) have been for some time—and where there is significant competition for lower prices. Online pharmacies or mail-order platforms are also increasingly competitive for generics, including with Amazon (AMZN) now in the mix.All of this has added to the competition that independent pharmacies have faced in recent years.Meanwhile, Cigna's PBM, Express Scripts, announced a strategy that would increase reimbursements to independent pharmacies that fill prescriptions for its members, plus a longer-term strategy to increase the importance of these pharmacies in the communities they serve.Mark Cuban: Offering a lifeline to indie pharmacies?

Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports)One for Express Scripts, according to president Adam Kautzner, is to ensure that underserved populations in both rural and urban areas finally get the attention they've been missing.Lack of access Underserved populations vary from rural areas to pockets that lack access in urban areas.The access gap has been amplified in recent years: Large retail chains like CVS, Walgreens (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) have announced that they have, or will be, closing locations. This year, CVS said it would shutter 900 outlets, but didn't specify where. (Rite Aid said it would open mini locations to serve rural areas.)A University of Southern California study shows that ""as of 2020, pharmacies in Black and Latino neighborhoods were more likely to close and less likely to offer immunizations, 24-hour, and drive-through services than pharmacies in other neighborhoods,"" according to the study's authors.The Cost Plus focus on these vulnerable populations can help independent pharmacies in these markets. The company recently announced a partnership with Zócalo Health, a telehealth platform that provides care for cash for underinsured and uninsured individuals in the LatinX market community, according to CEO Erik Cardenas. The National Hispanic Medical Association has told Congress that Latinos are more likely to be uninsured.It's why Zócalo teamed up with Cost Plus. The care providers at Zócalo can help ensure and track the fulfillment of prescription needs of patients, and answer questions about medications as needed.And the benefit goes both ways. The more independent pharmacies do business, the more drug manufacturers and insurers will too. Which is also why the additional screening and testing services, which could create more prescription volume, is part of the strategy.""By continuing to have accessibility to independent pharmacies, to keep them strong and to be able to continue to grow their own businesses, patients will be able to and get new prescriptions, refill their prescriptions, and stay adherent (to current prescriptions),"" Express Scripts' Kautzner said.More than drugs""I'm a pharmacist from rural America. So this area is also top of mind to me, of the role independent pharmacists play,"" Kautzner said.That's why he's spearheading the effort that will provide greater reimbursements for prescriptions for rural pharmacies that are within a 10-mile radius of an Express Scripts member.Express Scripts will also help boost the services such as common medical screenings and vaccinations.The company, meanwhile, is also convening a new advisory committee focused on independent pharmacies. That committee will also be instrumental in coordinating with state and federal government bodies to ensure these independent pharmacists are able to succeed. Kautzner said that in rural areas, which serve about 20% of the U.S. population, pharmacists sometimes are the only medical professional a person has access to as physicians are in short supply. ""So this is a way for them to expand the level of services that they can provide.""Kautzner said Express Scripts decided to launch the strategy after studying the independent pharmacy space last year and coming to the conclusion that there are more pharmacies opening up in some areas. He added: ""That's definitely encouraging, post-pandemic, that we are starting to see some of them continue to thrive and expand.""Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The stock has lost 23.5% compared with the industry’s 28.1% decline.Walgreens exited second-quarter fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company’s U.S. Healthcare business expanded, led by key contract wins, continued partnership growth and a strong focus on execution. The company continues to play a leading role in COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, administering 2.4 million vaccinations in the reported quarter. It has reaffirmed 2023 EPS guidance, reflecting continued growth momentum.Meanwhile, the intensifying competition in the U.S. pharmacy retail drugstore market has compelled Walgreens Boots to diversify its product offerings through new partnerships. In April 2023, Walgreens entered into a partnership with the Dublin-based biotech company, Prothena Corporation. The collaboration aims to accelerate patient identification and recruitment for Prothena’s ongoing ASCENT-2 multiple ascending dose clinical trial.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

The International segment was also impacted by an adverse currency impact of 7.5% in the second quarter.Story continuesMoreover, escalating costs and contraction of gross margin remain a concern. In the last few years, slowdown in generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. In addition, of late, increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering Walgreens’ margin on a significant level.In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, gross profit fell 8.5% year over year. Gross margin contracted 260 bps to 20.2%. Selling, general and administrative expenses were up 5.6%.Further, Walgreens Boots faces headwinds in the form of increased competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to grab market share from other traditional drug store retailers, major mass merchants such as Target and Wal-Mart are expanding their pharmacy businesses and enjoying a fair market share.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector are Penumbra PEN, Accelerate Diagnostics AXDX and SiBone SIBN.

This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home The ubiquitous coffee chain has instructed staff to begin charging extra for certain customizations of its popular Refreshers fruit drinks since Tuesday.Those that ask to hold the water will have to pay a dollar more, since it requires extra ingredients to be added.“Starbucks Refreshers beverages can still be customized with light or no ice free of charge,” a spokesperson told the New York Post.While responses on social media sites called the company “greedy” or “stingy”, some observers frustrated by the recent trend toward TikTok hacks that holds up the line and anger baristas applauded the move.“I couldn’t be more excited for the price increase!!!! Hack over,” wrote poster “MarielenaR” on the viral platform.When the popular drink first debuted in 2012, the company said it offered a “distinctly new take on thirst-quenching refreshment while providing a natural boost of energy from green coffee extract and real fruit juice.”The beverage, which uses caffeine from unroasted arabica beans, has since expanded to numerous flavors. Last week it won notable praise from finance chief Rachel Ruggeri as a difficult-to-replicate menu item that requires consumers to come to Starbucks to buy them.New changes in store under Schultz successorThe new charge is one of the first menu changes instituted under the leadership of Laxman Narasimhan, who took over from company founder Howard Schultz on March 20.When the board first named the native Indian, Schultz borrowed a metaphor from U.S. professional sports, calling the former Reckitt Benckiser CEO “a number one draft choice” that would obviate the need for him to return a fourth time as CEO. Story continuesDuring the second fiscal quarter conference call, it became clear the board hired him not just for his international background and experience in emerging markets, but for his background as a corporate consultant at McKinsey with a focus on efficiency and optimization.“To strengthen our health, we need to think of our businesses having theaters in the front with a factory in the back,” he told investors last Tuesday.In other words, everything a consumer sees when they enter a store should add to the Starbucks experience, while everything behind the curtain needs to operate like a well-oiled machine with as little waste, duplication and complexity as possible.“Currently we have over 1,500 cup and lid combinations across our network, as we streamline, we will create a portfolio of fewer, more sustainable and less costly cups while further simplifying operations in our stores,” he said. “All of these opportunities will deliver topline growth and margin expansion.”Perhaps most surprising however was his departure from the rule of thumb that if something isn’t broken, don’t fix it.“As a leadership team, we fully acknowledge a need to evolve and modernize our brand our business our capabilities and our culture to meet the needs of an ever-changing world. We are therefore re-founding the company and as part of that we are getting back to its basics.”Investors will likely have to wait another few months to find out from Narasimhan precisely what that means going forward.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Synergies from the Meggitt acquisition, coupled with benefits from the Win strategy, will bolster PH’s growth story in 2023. The company’s shareholder-friendly policies hold promise.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s Diversified Industrial segment is benefiting from continued broad-based growth in the North American region. The Diversified Industrial segment’s revenues increased 10.8% year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.Robust original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) and maintenance, repair and operations (“MRO”) commercial activity is aiding the Aerospace Systems segment. The Meggitt acquisition (September 2022), which has expanded PH’s presence in the UK, positioning it well to provide a broader suite of solutions for aircraft and aeroengine components and systems, has bolstered the Aerospace Systems unit. Revenues from the unit surged 88.9% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to contribution from the Meggitt buyout. PH expects to achieve synergies of $75 million from the buyout in fiscal 2023. By fiscal 2026, it expects to achieve synergies of $300 million.Improved margins, thanks to the unique Win Strategy (version 3.0 launched in fiscal 2020), which focuses on innovation, strategic positioning, distribution growth and incentive plan changes to drive organic growth, should drive Parker-Hannifin’s growth. With the Win strategy, the company’s adjusted EBITDA margin increased 80 basis points year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.Parker-Hannifin’s improved guidance for fiscal 2023 raises optimism in the stock. The company expects fiscal 2023 organic sales to increase approximately 10% compared with a rise of 6-8% anticipated earlier. Adjusted earnings are estimated to be between $20.60 and $20.90 per share compared with $19.20-$19.70 estimated earlier.Parker-Hannifin’s commitment to reward its shareholders through dividends is encouraging.  In April, PH hiked its dividend by 11% to $1.48 per share (annually: $5.92). In the first nine months of fiscal 2023, Parker-Hannifin rewarded its shareholders with dividends of $513.23 million, up 29% year over year.

It may not have been easy to hold on to PH for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Parker-Hannifin's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Parker-Hannifin's main business drivers.Parker-Hannifin Corporation is a global diversified manufacturer of motion &amp; control technologies and systems. The company provides precision engineered solutions for a wide variety of mobile, industrial and aerospace markets.Diversified Industrial Segment (73.4% of third-quarter fiscal 2023 sales): This segment is engaged in the production of a wide range of motion-control and fluid systems &amp; components. The products offered by this segment are used in transportation, mobile construction, refrigeration and air conditioning, agriculture and other markets.The segment sells its products through two main channels, namely, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and extensive distribution network to smaller OEMs and the aftermarket.Products offered include sealing devices (dynamic and static); filters, systems and instruments to monitor and remove contaminants from fuel, air, oil, water and other liquids and gases; fluid connectors that control, transmit and contain fluid; hydraulic components and systems for builders and users of industrial and mobile machinery and equipment; and high-quality flow control solutions.Aerospace Systems (23.6%): This segment supervises the designing and manufacturing of products and also provides aftermarket support for a broad range of aerospace products including commercial, business jet, military and general aviation aircraft and missile.Products offered include control actuation systems &amp; components, fluid metering, delivery &amp; atomization devices, fuel systems &amp; components, pneumatic control components, hydraulic systems &amp; components and lubrication components among others.The segment's products and services are offered to OEM and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) customers throughout the world. Notably, the products are marketed by field sales employees and are sold to manufacturers as well as end customers.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Parker-Hannifin a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in May 2013 would be worth $3,648.31, or a gain of 264.83%, as of May 10, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 153.23% and the price of gold went up 35.40% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for PH.Parker-Hannifin is poised for growth on the back of synergies from the Meggitt buyout (September 2022) and benefits from the Win strategy. The Meggitt buyout has bolstered the company’s Aerospace Systems unit (revenues jumped 88.9% year over year in the fiscal third quarter). Benefits from the Win strategy is driving the company’s margins. Strength in the Diversified Industrial segment due to growth in the North American region also bodes well for PH. The company’s measures to add shareholder value hold promise. In April, the company hiked its dividend by 11%. Backed by these tailwinds, shares of Parker-Hannifin have outperformed its industry so far this year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PH’s fiscal 2023 earnings has been revised upward in the past 60 days.

With 85% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Sysco. Check out our latest analysis for Sysco ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sysco?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Sysco already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Sysco's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Sysco. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.4%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.3% and 6.1% of the stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of SyscoWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Sysco Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$64m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

63,005c4993-d922-36c4-9a26-e7b6b047e0a8,XEL,2023-05-11,Those who invested in Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) five years ago are up 80%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-xcel-energy-nasdaq-103129126.html,1683801089,STORY,['XEL'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) share price is up 57% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 44% (ignoring dividends).With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Xcel Energy To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Xcel Energy managed to grow its earnings per share at 6.5% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 9% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Xcel Energy's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Xcel Energy's TSR for the last 5 years was 80%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveXcel Energy shareholders are down 3.6% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 6.3%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 13%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Xcel Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Xcel Energy has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  we think you should know about.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

64,e3dfb32b-84d5-3511-b7e8-b1ec63914006,ADM,2023-05-11,Why You Might Be Interested In Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) For Its Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-interested-archer-daniels-101345188.html,1683800025,STORY,['ADM'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase Archer-Daniels-Midland's shares before the 16th of May in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 7th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.45 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.80 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Archer-Daniels-Midland has a trailing yield of 2.4% on the current share price of $74.64. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Archer-Daniels-Midland's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Archer-Daniels-Midland paid out just 21% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Dividends consumed 56% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see Archer-Daniels-Midland's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 24% per annum for the past five years.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Archer-Daniels-Midland has delivered an average of 9.9% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Archer-Daniels-Midland? From a dividend perspective, we're encouraged to see that earnings per share have been growing, the company is paying out less than half of its earnings, and a bit over half its free cash flow. There's a lot to like about Archer-Daniels-Midland, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Archer-Daniels-Midland is facing. To help with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Archer-Daniels-Midland that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

66,fdab8a29-2733-3ea9-9670-576cc9c8c24c,HST,2023-05-11,Bet on These 5 Low Leverage Stocks to Avoid Market Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bet-5-low-leverage-stocks-104710432.html,1683715630,STORY,"['INSW', 'HST', 'ALK']","[Wall Street stocks closed lower on May 9 as investors remained concerned about the scheduled meeting between U.S. political leaders related to the debt ceiling and its outcome. On top of that inflation woes are still looming large on the U.S. stock market.Considering the current situation, an investor might not feel encouraged to invest in the stock market. However, a prudent investor knows that this is the right time to buy stocks that are safe bets. To this end, we recommend stocks like e.l.f. Beauty ELF, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts HST, Alaska Air Group ALK, Addus HomeCare ADUS and International Seaways INSW, which bear low leverage and therefore can shield investors from incurring losses in times of crisis.Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let’s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to exorbitant debt financing.Therefore, the crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.Such an event shows how volatile the equity market can be at times and as an investor if you don’t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks, which bear low leverage and are hence less risky.To identify such stocks, historically several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Story continuesAnalyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.With the first-quarter earnings cycle almost in its last lap, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.Yet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen.e.l.f. Beauty: It operates as a cosmetic company. On Apr 27, 2023, the company launched its new digital series, ""Vanity Table Talk."", which is the social-first show. It is a playful mashup of popular formats, including the late-night talk show and the TikTok-native Get Ready With Me (GRWM). Much like TikTok’s viral GRWM format, guests will sit solo at e.l.f.’s gorgeous vanity and apply products while storytelling and reacting to questions flying in from off-camera.ELF delivered an earnings surprise of 104.99%, on average, in the trailing four quarters. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 currently. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 earnings implies a 70.3% improvement from the fiscal 2022 reported figure.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts: It is one of the leading lodging real estate investment trusts (REITs), engaged in the ownership, acquisition, and redevelopment of luxury and upper-upscale hotels in the United States and abroad. In May 2023, the company released its first-quarter 2023 results, wherein its comparable hotel RevPAR increased 31% from the first quarter of 2022, exceeding the top end of its guidance by four percentage points.HST currently has a Zacks Rank #2. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 14.58% in the last reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales suggests a 6.7% improvement year over year.Alaska Air Group: It is an airline company, which, together with its partner regional carriers, serves more than 120 cities across North America.

She was smoking a pack per day by high school.She tried quitting on several occasions using various methods from nicotine patches to hypnotism, before she managed to stop smoking for a nine-month period in 1979 and 1980, the court said.When she resumed smoking after the nine-month pause, she switched from Marlboro Red cigarettes to Marlboro Lights after seeing advertising promsing that they delivered less tar and less nicotine, the court said.She smoked a pack of Marlboro Lights per day until she finally quit for good in 1995.Greene was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2013, which had spread to her brain by 2018, requiring multiple surgeries and radiation, the court said.Greene first sued Philip Morris in Middlesex Superior Court in 2015. The company was found liable for civil conspiracy and Greene was awarded the judgment in 2021.Philip Morris appealed, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support the judgments against it, and saying that interest rates that resulted in the final award amount were excessive.]"

However, the van and reefer TVI numbers were the lowest since February 2021, when a polar vortex and unprecedented winter storms disrupted logistics activity across large areas of the United States and Canada.""May will be pivotal for shippers, brokers and carriers,"" said Ken Adamo, DAT’s Chief of Analytics. ""After a challenging first four months of the year, we expect to see the effects of seasonality on freight volumes and rates. The question is how sustainable those effects will be.""Truckload demand and pricing easedNational average load-to-truck ratios decreased, indicating weaker demand for truckload capacity on the spot market. The last time van and reefer ratios were this low was May and April 2020, respectively, during the supply chain shocks of the pandemic:The van ratio was 1.9, down from 2.0 in March, and 3.4 in April 2022.The reefer ratio was 2.7, down from 3.0 in March and 6.3 year over year.The flatbed ratio was 12.1, down from 12.1 in March and 64.5 year over year.Lower demand for truckload services led to a drop in national average spot van and reefer rates:The spot van rate averaged $2.06 per mile, down 10 cents compared to March and 71 cents lower year over year.The spot reefer rate fell 9 cents to $2.41 a mile, 72 cents lower than in April 2022.The spot flatbed rate dipped 4 cents to $2.67 a mile, down 70 cents year over year.Story continuesLine-haul rates, which subtract an amount equal to a fuel surcharge, continued a pattern of month-over-month declines in 2023. The national average van line-haul rate was $1.59 per mile, down 8 cents compared to March, while the reefer line-haul rate fell 7 cents to $1.89 a mile. The average flatbed line-haul rate was $2.10 a mile, down 2 cents.Fuel surcharge amounts fell 2 cents to an average of 47 cents a mile for van freight, 52 cents for reefers and 57 cents for flatbeds. At $4.10 a gallon, the price of diesel was 11 cents lower compared to March.Will seasonality kick in?National average rates for contracted freight were lower compared to March but the spread between contract and spot rates rose to near all-time highs: 62 cents for van freight, 60 cents reefers and 66 cents for flatbeds.Adamo called the spread between spot and contract rates ""an indicator of where we’re at in the freight cycle—the balance of bargaining power among shippers, brokers, and carriers.""For the gap to close, two things need to happen. ""One, the supply of trucks on the spot market needs to diminish, which unfortunately means more carriers exiting the market. Two, there needs to be higher demand for trucks—in other words, shippers with more loads than they planned for.""In 2016 and 2019, it was precisely the third week in May when the spot market entered a recovery phase after prolonged declines and stagnation,"" he explained. ""Seasonality kicked in and shippers needed more trucks to move fresh produce, construction materials, imports and summer and back-to-school retail goods. If we see an uptick in demand before Memorial Day, it will be a welcome sign for owner-operators and small carriers as we head into the summer and fall.""About the DAT Truckload Volume IndexThe DAT Truckload Volume Index reflects the change in the number of loads with a pickup date during that month; the actual index number is normalized each month to accommodate any new data sources without distortion. A baseline of 100 equals the number of loads moved in January 2015, as recorded in DAT RateView, a truckload pricing database and analysis tool with rates paid on an average of 3 million loads per month.Spot truckload rates are negotiated for each load and paid to the carrier by a freight broker. National average spot rates are derived from payments to carriers by freight brokers, third-party logistics providers and other transportation buyers for hauls of 250 miles or more with a pickup date during the month reported. DAT’s rate analysis is based on $150 billion in annualized freight transactions.Load-to-truck ratios reflect truckload supply and demand on the DAT One marketplace and indicate the pricing environment for truckload freight.About DAT Freight &amp; AnalyticsDAT Freight &amp; Analytics operates the largest truckload freight marketplace in North America. Shippers, transportation brokers, carriers, news organizations and industry analysts rely on DAT for market trends and data insights based on more than 400 million freight matches and a database of $150 billion in annual market transactions.Founded in 1978, DAT is a wholly owned subsidiary of Roper Technologies (NYSE: ROP), a diversified technology company and constituent of the S&amp;P 500 and Fortune 500 indices.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230510005873/en/ContactsAnnabel ReevesCorporate Communications, DAT Freight &amp; AnalyticsPR@dat.com / annabel.reeves@dat.com; 503-501-0143]"

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for TransDigm Group The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.32bUS$1.64bUS$1.89bUS$2.10bUS$2.25bUS$2.38bUS$2.49bUS$2.59bUS$2.67bUS$2.75bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x2Est @ 7.25%Est @ 5.71%Est @ 4.63%Est @ 3.87%Est @ 3.34%Est @ 2.97% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8% US$1.2kUS$1.4kUS$1.5kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$14bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.8%– 2.1%) = US$49bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$49b÷ ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$23bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$38b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$810, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TransDigm Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.957. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TransDigm GroupStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Healthy industrial and manufacturing activities augur well for the industry.Industry players like PPG Industries, Inc. PPG, Axalta Coating Systems Ltd. AXTA and Livent Corporation LTHM are poised to benefit from healthy demand. Strategic actions, including operating cost reductions, are also expected to help these companies navigate a still-challenging environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Chemicals Specialty industry consists of manufacturers of specialty chemical products for a host of end-use markets such as textile, paper, automotive, electronics, personal care, energy, construction, food &amp; beverages and agriculture. These chemicals (including catalysts, surfactants, specialty polymers, coating additives, pesticides and oilfield chemicals) are used based on their performance and have a specific purpose. Specialty chemicals can be single molecules or a combination of molecules referred to as formulations, and they provide a vast range of effects upon which various industries rely. Their compositions significantly influence the performance of the finished products. Specialty chemicals have applications in the manufacturing process of a vast range of products, including paints and coatings, cosmetics, petroleum products, inks and plastics.What's Shaping the Future of the Chemical Specialty Industry?Improved End-Market Demand Augurs Well: Companies in the chemical specialty space are expected to gain from higher demand across several major industries — including automotive. Demand for specialty chemicals is expected to be supported by an uptick in global industrial and manufacturing activities. Demand in the automotive market has improved this year after sluggishness in 2022, further aided by a recovery in automotive production on improved supply of semiconductors and other key inputs. Automotive OEM production is expected to improve in 2023 with the easing of the chip supply shortage and the ramp-up of production in China, post lockdowns. Moreover, a recovery in the construction sector bodes well for specialty chemical companies. These companies are also seeing higher demand in electronics and agriculture end markets. Improved demand is likely to support volumes of these companies over the near term.Self-Help Actions to Aid Results: The companies in this space are executing a raft of self-help measures — including cost-cutting and productivity improvement, expansion into high-growth markets, restructuring, operational efficiency improvement, and actions to strengthen the balance sheet and boost cash flows — in a bid to stay afloat amid the prevailing headwinds. Notably, the industry participants are aggressively implementing actions to cut costs. The measures are likely to help the companies sail through the ongoing challenges.Input Cost Pressure a Worry: Specialty chemical makers are facing headwinds from raw material cost inflation, and supply-chain and freight transportation disruptions. The closure of a large swath of factories to stem the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak disrupted the global supply chain. This has affected the availability of key raw materials for the chemical specialty industry. Some of the companies are also facing challenges from elevated logistics and labor costs. The shipping bottlenecks have led to a surge in freight costs. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and new lockdowns in China following a resurgence in coronavirus infections have put further pressure on the global supply chain. The lingering impacts of supply chain and logistic bottlenecks are expected to continue over the short haul and exert pressure on the margins of chemical specialty companies.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Upbeat ProspectsThe Zacks Chemicals Specialty industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #125, which places it in the top 50% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a bright near term.

Let's head over to Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith who's at the Goldman Sachs Industrial and Materials Conference. So, Seana, what are you seeing?SEANA SMITH: So, Rachelle, Yahoo Finance has exclusive access here to the Industrial and Materials Conference being put on by Goldman Sachs. We are hearing from the top names within those two sectors.One of the big themes that we are talking about is really just the landscape right now for the economy and what the second half of the year looks like. Last hour we spoke to the CEO of RXO, the truck brokerage business, Drew Wilkerson. And he was telling us that, yes, the macro environment is very, quote, ""tough,"" but he is optimistic about the improvement that we could see in the second half of the year.When we get to a couple of other big themes-- I was just listening in on a fireside chat with the CFO of Southwest, Tammy Romo, and she was saying that the company continues to see strong demand for travel, that leisure demand is really what has been driving the numbers here. She expects that to continue in the very important summer season.Another big theme is investment in technology. AI, we know that certainly has been the buzzword, Rachelle, over the last several months. Well, it's a buzzword right here at this conference today. RXO was saying that they had actually been investing in AI for 10 years, but they plan to incorporate it more and more. Differing in terms of what we've heard from some of those tech giants, they don't necessarily see it replacing jobs, rather really helping productivity here with each of their employees.Southwest also has plans to continue to invest in technology. We know that their network has had some issues over the last several months, and Romo saying that she expects the network to be in a much better place towards the end of the year.Story continuesOf course, there is some buzz around the debt ceiling, what exactly that will mean for these larger companies. Now, there is an optimistic tone in terms of the fact that people still think that lawmakers are going to get a deal done. But like Wilkerson told us, the CEO of RXO, that you need to be agile. You need to be flexible. You need to be ready to adapt to all different types of markets. That certainly has been the case over the last few years for these business leaders.Coming up later today, I will be speaking with Mike Battles. He's a co-CEO of Clean Harbors. Really getting a sense of the waste and recycling business where he is seeing demand there.Now, this company has certainly been an outperformer. Shares up 20% since the start of the year-- since the start of the year, nearly 40% over the past year. So we're going to talk about what is driving that business right now and also talk about reshoring and regulation efforts and exactly how that plays in to Clean Harbors. So we've got all that for you coming up here on Yahoo Finance today, Rachelle.]"

(GS) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-goldman-sachs-group-130001704.html,1683723601,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[Goldman Sachs (GS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned -0.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Goldman falls in, has lost 0.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Goldman is expected to post earnings of $7.89 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $31.83 points to a change of +5.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $36.54 indicates a change of +14.8% from what Goldman is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Goldman.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Goldman, the consensus sales estimate of $12.32 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.8%. The $48.45 billion and $51.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.3% and +6.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGoldman reported revenues of $12.22 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.5%. EPS of $8.79 for the same period compares with $10.76 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.03 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -6.16%. The EPS surprise was +7.99%.Over the last four quarters, Goldman surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Goldman is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Goldman. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The three largest North American containerboard/box producers reported box demand declines ranging from 8%-13% in Q1, and demand has been consistently worse than they expected over the past three quarters. The third-largest producer, Packaging Corp. of America, reported a historically large 13% shipment decline in Q1, though it said on its earnings call April 25 that it had seen a “big turnaround” starting in April, with bookings in the first 13 days of the month 11% higher than those in March. Two weeks later (Tuesday), the Tri-City Herald reported that Packaging Corp. is indefinitely idling one of its seven containerboard mills (in Wallula, Washington) that produces about 1,800 tons of paper a day, a decision that will result in hundreds of layoffs.Why would the company be indefinitely idling a sizable mill when demand is improving? The answer to that question isn’t clear to us. Based on several economic indicators that we track (of which the freight market is one), there’s no reason to expect improvement in box/goods demand anytime soon. Just Wednesday, in fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released April real (inflation-adjusted) earnings; real average weekly earnings have been falling for two years, a trend that continued in April. Bank lending standards are tightening and loan demand is weakening, facts made clear in the April 2023 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices that was released on Monday. And small business confidence hit a 10-year low in April, according to a report from the National Federation of Independent Business on Tuesday.The post Another sign of profound box demand weakness appears appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani Kalani who's got all the details for us. Anjalee.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right, Akiko. Historic day for women's health, a historic milestone at the least, with this advisory committee voting in favor, unanimously, in a 17 to 0 vote to allow Opill that's Perrigo's birth control pill, to be available over the counter without a prescription. Now, in a quote from the company's CEO to Yahoo Finance, they said today's vote is a ""new groundbreaking chapter in reproductive health.""And Perrigo noting that they are leading the way in making contraception more available to women. This, of course, comes at a time where we're dealing with the impact of the overturning of Roe v Wade and a lot of concern over the access to abortion pill around the country. So this is one step back from that in birth control itself.The business opportunity is quite huge for the company, according to JPM. $100 million opportunity not currently accounted in current guidance. And they're seeing the market as mostly uninsured women between the ages of 15 and 49. So that's about 10% of the population right now.And of course, we know there are other channels as well that could potentially benefit from this. When we heard from the advisory committee members, there is some concern about the FDA and their concerns looking at potential access for adolescents, so that younger portion of the population, as well as individuals who might have conflicts with medication or the like, and whether or not they might be able to access that.To that point, one of the voting members, that's Dr. Evey Epsey, from the chair of the University of New Mexico's Department of OB-GYNs, said, quote, ""it would take a very high bar of concern to justify non approval of over-the-counter status given what we know about the medication."" And then another voting member, Dr. Leslie Walker-Harding, saying that it-- she would not really support any restrictions on adolescents. But, again, it is up to the FDA, the final say. And JPM analysts did say that this puts a lot of pressure on the regulatory agency now to make a decision, which we expect to happen sometime this summer.]"

""We are motivated by the millions of people who need easy access to safe and effective contraception. Today's outcome reflects Perrigo's steadfast commitment to women and people, and their health.""Opill® consists of 0.075 mg norgestrel, which has been used to prevent pregnancy in millions of women in the U.S. since it was approved by the FDA in 1973. Nearly 50 years of use and scientific evidence show that progestin-only pills such as Opill® are effective at preventing pregnancy and are safe for most women to use.The Opill® OTC development program, conducted over the last eight years, included several Label Comprehension studies (LCS) that demonstrated consumers could understand the OTC label, and an actual use trial, ACCESS (Adherence with Continuous Dose Oral Contraceptive: Evaluation of Self-Selection and Use), which showed that consumers could use Opill® correctly based on the label, and follow the dosing instructions. Notably, adherence in the ACCESS study, taking the pill daily, was no different from published data on oral contraception adherence in the prescription setting(1).Story continuesAdditionally, Perrigo's data package included a published pregnancy impact model that estimated the number of unintended pregnancies Opill® OTC could prevent, demonstrating the significant impact the switch to OTC could have on personal and public health in the United States. Overall, data demonstrate that consumers can use Opill® safely and effectively as guided by the proposed labeling and highlight the benefits of removing the prescription barrier to oral contraception access.""Today's vote reflects the strong data showing that Opill® can be used safely and effectively over-the-counter,"" said Frederique Welgryn, Perrigo Global Vice President for Women's Health. ""FDA's approval of Opill® for over-the-counter use would address a key unmet need for contraceptive access, be a groundbreaking expansion for women's health nationwide and a step forward toward ensuring people can have improved access to contraception without unnecessary barriers.""Nearly one-third of adult U.S. women who have ever tried to obtain a prescription or refill for a contraceptive pill, patch, or ring reported difficulties doing so. Removing the prescription requirement with Opill® would improve access to a contraceptive method that is well tolerated and notably more effective at preventing pregnancy than all current methods available OTC(2).OTC oral contraception has support from major medical organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association, and the American Academy of Family Physicians. If approved, Opill® would be the first birth control pill available over-the-counter in the U.S.(1) Bosworth, 2018; Burnier, 2019; Potter, 1996; Fox, 2003; Hou, 2010.(2) Trussel et al, Contraceptive technology. 21st ed. 2018.

90,a0cfdba5-3290-3f65-bbcf-91bb36c696be,PRGO,2023-05-11,FDA panel backs over-the-counter sales of birth control pill,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-panel-backs-over-counter-172451701.html,1683739491,STORY,['PRGO'],"[WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal health advisers said Wednesday that a decades-old birth control pill should be sold without a prescription, paving the way for a likely U.S. approval of the first over-the-counter contraceptive medication.The panel of FDA advisers voted unanimously in favor of drugmaker Perrigo’s request to sell its once-a-day medication on store shelves alongside eye drops and allergy pills. The recommendation came at the close of a two-day meeting focused on whether women could safely and effectively take the pill without professional supervision. A final FDA decision is expected this summer.If the agency follows the nonbinding recommendation, Perrigo’s drug, Opill, would become the first contraceptive pill to be moved out from behind the pharmacy counter. The company said sales could begin late this year if OK'd.The outside experts said they were mostly confident that women of all ages could use the drug appropriately without seeing a health provider first.“In the balance between benefit and risk, we’d have a hard time justifying not taking this action,"" said Maria Coyle, an Ohio State University pharmacist, who chaired the panel. “The drug is incredibly effective, and I think it will be effective in the over-the-counter realm just as it is in the prescription realm.""The positive vote came despite numerous criticisms from FDA scientists about how Perrigo studied the drug, including questions about whether study participants were able to understand and follow labeling instructions.“We have an application with many complicated issues and uncertainties, including questionable reliability,” FDA’s Dr. Pamela Horn told panelists on Tuesday.But the panel largely set those concerns aside, emphasizing the benefits of providing more effective birth control — particularly to young people and lower-income groups — than what’s available over the counter now, like condoms and gels.Most birth control pills used in the U.S. today contain a combination of progestin and estrogen. Opill is part of an older class of contraceptives that only contain progestin. They generally have fewer side effects and health risks but can be less effective if they’re not taken around the same time daily.Story continuesFDA’s decision won’t apply to other birth control pills although advocates hope that an approval decision might push other drugmakers to seek over-the-counter sales. Birth control pills are available without a prescription across much of South America, Asia and Africa.Opill was first approved in the U.S. five decades ago based on data showing it was more than 90% effective in preventing pregnancy when taken daily. Even if the pill is approved for over the counter, it’s unclear how popular it might be. Opill has not been marketed in the U.S. since 2005.Some women should not take it, particularly those with breast cancer, because of the risk that it could accelerate tumor growth. Women who have unusual vaginal bleeding are instructed to speak with a doctor before using it, because bleeding could indicate a serious health issue.But in reading comprehension studies conducted by Perrigo, 68% of women with unexplained bleeding incorrectly answered they could take the drug. And a few women with breast cancer also told researchers they could use Opill.Panel members said almost all women with a history of breast cancer would be under the care of a cancer specialist, who would advise them not to take hormonal drugs that could make their condition worse.“I would think any woman who had a breast cancer diagnosis in the past would be highly aware of that, so I don’t think that’s going to be a concern,” said Dr. Deborah Armstrong of Johns Hopkins University.Perrigo said its 880-patient study of the drug showed that women will consistently take the pill daily if it’s made available over-the-counter. But the FDA found several problems in the study, including more than 30% of participants who erroneously reported taking more pills than they were actually supplied. FDA reviewers said the problem called into question the company’s overall conclusions about the drug’s use and effectiveness.FDA regulators also suggested changes in U.S. demographics since the pill was first tested — including increased obesity and other chronic conditions— could reduce the drug’s effectiveness.Despite those concerns, Opill has the support of dozens of reproductive rights and medical groups that have long pushed for expanded access to birth control.“Opill over the counter would give us one more option for access and the more options that are available the better,” said Clare Coleman, president of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health AssociationColeman was one of more than 25 speakers who supported Perrigo’s application during a public comment session Tuesday.Catholic groups, including the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, oppose the move, saying women should be evaluated by a doctor before getting it.Perrigo has not publicly discussed pricing for the drug, if approved. Nonprescription medicines are usually cheaper, but generally not covered by insurance. Requiring insurers to cover over-the-counter birth control would require a regulatory change by the federal government.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

PEN America will not be presenting the award this year, saying the honor is premised upon the recipient accepting in person.The Gala, to be held May 18 at the American Museum of Natural History, is one of the year's literary highlights and will feature the presentation of several awards, including one to “Saturday Night Live” creator Lorne Michaels for Literary Service.“Given the threat to disrupt this wonderful evening, I thought it was best to pull out so as not to distract from the important work that PEN America does for writers and journalists, as well as the celebration of my friend and personal hero Lorne Michaels,"" Sarandos said in a statement released Wednesday by Netflix. ""I hope the evening is a great success.”A PEN spokesperson said that no one this year will be given the Business Visionary Award, which in 2022 was won by Audible founder Don Katz. A Netflix spokesperson said there would be no comment beyond Sarandos' statement.Michaels, whose show has been off the air since the strike began May 2, is still planning to attend, according to PEN. The head writer at SNL, Writers Guild member Colin Jost, will be serving as emcee.In a statement Wednesday, PEN America praised Sarandos' “singular work translating literature to artful presentation on screen and his stalwart defense of free expression and satire,"" and added that as ""a writers organization, we have been following recent events closely and understand his decision.“Our Gala program, with honorees including Saturday Night Live‘s Lorne Michaels and emcee Colin Jost, will center on the escalating campaign of book bans in this country, tightening constraints on satire and comedy, and support of threatened writers worldwide.

He may not like what you are going to tell him, but as long as you are not surprising him you will be OK,"" American Express Stephen Squeri told Yahoo! Finance.Execs at media giant Paramount — where Buffett is a 15.3% holder after building an initial stake in Nov. 2022 — must not have gotten that sage advice from the OG investor.And that calls into question what the Oracle will do next with his ownership stake.Last week, Paramount — which has made major progress on the streaming subscriber front with Paramount+ — surprised the heck out of investors like Buffett.Paramount posted a first quarter direct to consumer business loss of $511 million. A year ago, Paramount's direct to consumer business lost $456 million.That's a lot of losses for a business like Paramount+, which had 60 million subscribers exiting the first quarter. But it underscores how costly it is to produce content such as the hit Paramount show Yellowstone while also staying sharp on pricing to compete with fellow streamers Netflix, Disney, Amazon, etc.It's just a brutal business to be in.The fact ad revenue in Paramount's traditional TV business is under pressure in part to macroeconomic conditions only amplifies the losses at the streaming business.""Paramount is still moving through a difficult combination of heavy investments to try to offset structural decline in a weak cyclical top-line environment,"" said Macquarie Research analyst Tim Nollen in a client note.Nollen maintained an under-perform rating on Paramount's stock.Story continuesThe company then surprised investors again — such as Buffett — by slashing its quarterly dividend to $0.05 from $0.24.Buffett loves dividends. He loves collecting the big fat checks from a Coca-Cola and aforementioned AmEx.Now he stands to collect smaller quarterly checks from Paramount, provided he still owns the stock.Buffett is likely to release a 13f filing early next week disclosing movements in his vast stock portfolio. If Paramount isn't in there — or the stake has been reduced — Paramount investors could feel more pain.Buffett didn't exactly voice support for the company at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.“It’s not good news when any company cuts its dividend dramatically,"" Buffett told a packed CHI Health Center.No it's not, Warren.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

(NFLX) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-inc-nflx-attracting-investor-130001310.html,1683723601,STORY,['NFLX'],"[Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this internet video service have returned -1.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has lost 5.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Netflix is expected to post earnings of $2.80 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.19 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.5%. This estimate has changed -0.8% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.56 indicates a change of +30.1% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NFLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.25 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $33.77 billion and $37.81 billion estimates indicate +6.8% and +12% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNetflix reported revenues of $8.16 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.7%. EPS of $2.88 for the same period compares with $3.53 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.18 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.25%. The EPS surprise was +1.77%.Over the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Netflix is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the metric declined 9.5% from the prior-year reported figure.Total revenues of $560.7 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $564 million and our estimate of $562.4 million. Markedly, total revenues increased 4.3% year over year.We note that subscription revenues improved year over year. Digital-only subscriber average revenue per user increased on a sequential basis to $9.04 from $8.93 in the preceding quarter. Both digital and print advertising revenues declined year over year due to cyclical challenges. Nonetheless, the company’s strategic bundled subscription offering is gaining momentum.Subscription Revenues RiseSubscription revenues of $397.5 million grew 6.9% year over year. The upside can be attributed to an increase in the number of subscribers to the company’s digital-only products, the benefits of subscriptions graduating to higher prices from introductory promotional pricing and higher revenues from The Athletic stand-alone subscriptions.Subscription revenues from digital-only products jumped 14.1% to $258.8 million. However, print subscription revenues fell 4.4% to $138.8 million due to lower domestic home delivery revenues, which declined 4.2%.The company ended the quarter with roughly 9.73 million paid subscribers across its print and digital products. Of the 9.73 million subscribers, approximately 9.02 million were paid digital-only subscribers. There was a net increase of 190,000 and 790,000 digital-only subscribers compared with the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2022, respectively.Management envisions second-quarter 2023 subscription revenues to increase about 6-8%, with digital-only subscription revenues anticipated to rise approximately 12-15%.The New York Times Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe New York Times Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe New York Times Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The New York Times Company QuoteStory continuesA Look at Advertising RevenuesTotal advertising revenues of $106.2 million witnessed a decline of 8.6% from the prior-year period. The challenging macroeconomic environment hit digital and print advertising spend.Print advertising revenues declined 8.7% to $45 million in the quarter under review. The metric decreased primarily in the media, advocacy, finance and technology categories, partly offset by growth in the luxury category.Meanwhile, digital advertising revenues fell 8.6% to $61.3 million. This year-over-year decrease was due to lower revenues from podcasts and creative services, partly offset by the addition of digital advertising revenues from The Athletic.For the second quarter of 2023, The New York Times Company expects a low-to-mid-single-digit decline in digital advertising revenues and a 4-8% decline in total advertising revenues.Other HighlightsWe note that other revenues jumped 15.8% year over year to $57 million during the quarter under review due to higher revenues from television and film, licensing and commercial printing. The New York Times Company estimates high-single-digit growth in other revenues in the second quarter of 2023.Adjusted operating costs rose 6.3% to $506.7 million during the quarter. Management anticipates adjusted operating costs to increase approximately 6-8% in the second quarter of 2023.The total adjusted operating profit decreased 11.4% to $54 million during the quarter under review. Higher adjusted operating costs and lower advertising revenues more than offset higher digital subscription and other revenues.Segment DetailsThe New York Times Group’s revenues increased 1.3% year over year to $532.1 million. Subscription revenues rose 3.3% to $373.5 million due to growth in subscription revenues from digital-only products, partially offset by decreases in print subscription revenues. Advertising revenues fell 10.8% to $102.1 million, stemming from soft digital and print advertising revenues.The adjusted operating profit decreased 8.8% to $61.8 million. This can be attributed to higher adjusted operating costs and lower advertising revenues, partially offset by higher digital subscription and other revenues.Revenues totaled $28.6 million in The Athletic segment, primarily from subscription revenues. Subscription revenues rose to $24.1 million from $10.4 million in the first quarter of 2022, mainly due to an increase in digital-only subscribers with The Athletic and the favorable impact of an additional month in 2023. The adjusted operating loss amounted to $7.8 million.Financial AspectsThe New York Times Company ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of about $474.4 million, reflecting a decrease of $11.9 million from $486.3 million as of Dec 31, 2022.The company incurred capital expenditures of about $6 million during the quarter. Management envisions capital expenditures of about $50 million in 2023.The board of directors authorized a $150 million share repurchase program in February 2022. As of May 5, 2023, the company repurchased 3,937,593 shares for about $135.7 million, and $14.3 million remained under the authorization. In February 2023, The New York Times Company’s board of directors also approved a new $250 million Class A share buyback program.We note that this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has risen 20.7% so far in the year compared with the industry’s growth of 18.8%.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.4%.Revenues are expected to be $11.82 billion, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.18% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for TJX?For TJX, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.70%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that TJX will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that TJX would post earnings of $0.89 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.89, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.TJX doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Welcome to GAN Limited's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Robert Shore. Robert, you may begin.Robert Jason ShoreThanks, Morgan, and good afternoon, everyone. GAN's first quarter 2023 earnings release was issued today after the market closed and is posted on the company's website at gan.com.With me today are Dermot Smurfit, President and CEO; and Brian Chang, Interim CFO. I'd like to remind our audience today that we may make forward-looking statements on the call which are protected under our safe harbor afforded by the Federal Securities laws and in each case are qualified with our forward-looking disclaimers contained in our earnings release. Please refer to our filing with the SEC to understand how we calculate any of these metrics discussed in today's call. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Dermot Smurfit. Dermot, go ahead, please.Dermot Stopford SmurfitThank you, Bobby, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to update the market today that our iGaming exclusivity in the U.S. for FanDuel Group has now been extended on a rolling basis following the expiration of the initial exclusivity period in the first quarter. We believe this has been an overhang of uncertainty, and I'd like to thank the executives at FanDuel Group continuing to trust GAN with providing FanDuel with our mission-critical B2B solution. I'll also take the brief opportunity to highlight our B2C division's significant value proposition with revenues of nearly $90 million last year and an all-time revenue record in our largest B2C market achieved last month speaking to the underlying growth opportunity ahead of us. The B2C division has also contributed their award-winning modern international sports technology to our B2B division which, during the first quarter, was deployed at scale in both retail and online channels in Massachusetts for Wynn Resorts Encore Boston Harbor property. Wynn just reported a 20% increase in sign-ups to their Wynn Rewards loyalty program year-to-date attributed to their new sports book, and I believe that B2B partnership has an exciting future as we roll out together across the nation. In the first quarter, therefore, we made solid progress in executing our strategy in such a way that we are confident we will ultimately drive revenue gains and reduce our cost structure. Post quarter end, we disclosed a restructuring of our debt with Sega Sammy Holdings, Inc. that puts us on a significantly stronger financial footing. Firstly, we materially reduced our annual cash interest cost; and secondly, we eliminated potential covenant issues. Furthermore, we reduced the cost of exclusively licensing Ainsworth's iGaming content by $15 million in exchange for a small equity stake in our company. We also elected to exit our B2C division from the highly competitive Ontario, Canada market in order to deploy our marketing capital in faster rate of return markets available to us in Latin America. And as a reminder, our B2B division continues in Ontario, Canada as both the exclusive PAM and iGaming platform provider to FanDuel, which is a strong partnership executing well together since launch just 1 year ago. These 3 steps already taken in this strategic review process evidence our clear commitment towards realizing shareholder value. Step 1, restructure our debt; step 2, reduced exclusive Ainsworth iGaming content costs; and step 3, exit B2C from Ontario. Speaking to the first step taken, I could not be happier with the outcome of this strategic debt capital refinancing, which I'm confident will be beneficial to our shareholders, our employees and, of course, our B2B clients. And I'll speak a bit more on the broader strategic review process in my closing remarks. So getting into the first quarter results. We generated revenue of $35.1 million, which was a decrease of 6% from the prior year quarter. The decline was primarily related to a decrease in our contractual revenue rates with the client in the B2B division, which correspondingly decreased our overall take rate for the B2B division. With respect to our take rate, we do expect this trend to trend upwards in the coming quarters as we roll out GAN Sports across the United States. Our sports betting technology capability and particularly our retail sports betting technology carries a favorable economic model. Positively, our contract with the largest B2B customer remains in place until January of 2025 and some of the rate decreases partially offset by their market share gains in domestic iGaming. B2C revenues in the first quarter were consistent year-over-year even when factoring in adverse foreign exchange with modest underlying growth on a local currency basis. In the wake of the World Cup, nearly 40% of new customers acquired during that soccer tournament were retained on coolbet.com, which recently benefited from major soccer sponsorships in key Latin American markets, which appear to be performing well with an all-time record in revenues and active players last month, pointing towards a solid return to growth for our B2C division. The underlying key performance indicators or KPIs, excluding the take rate, were very strong across both of our operating segments. On the B2B side, we processed $423 million of gross operator revenue through our platform, which was an increase of over 40% from the prior year period. B2C KPIs remain healthy post the soccer World Cup with double-digit or 12% growth in new customers. And importantly, our marketing spend ratio remains well below U.S. peers at just 21%. Notably, this ratio is even lower for Latin American markets, which is a key focus of ours to drive profitable growth in geographies where we see better return profiles from customer acquisition marketing. Adjusted EBITDA was modestly positive as cost-saving measures offset the decrease in our revenue. The team remains focused on profitability. And as we've mentioned in prior quarters, all our new real money iGaming or sports gambling B2B clients will be launching on the new GameSTACK 2.0 version of our technology platform. While our first quarter revenue results are a bit lighter than our expectations, we're making great strides to reallocate resources to our higher return opportunities, to diversify our revenue base and transition to our new technology platform that will meaningfully accelerate our scalability and improve our cost structure. As we noted last quarter, our focus simply put, is on B2B GAN Sports and LatAm B2C. On GAN Sports, we've laid the groundwork for what we believe is the #1 sports betting solution in the U.S. market with a marquee client roster to prove it. In Massachusetts, our major partnership with Wynn Resorts yielded impressive 60-plus percent share of handle at the retail channel, attracting major VIP sports gamblers with individual retail sports wagers placed in excess of $100,000 on popular local and national sporting events, including the Super Bowl and March Madness. The historic regular season run by the Bruins resulted in a high level of betting interest, but certainly proved to impact the overall performance margins of the retail book, while the mobile operations delivered very promising results in the first week of operations and are continuing well into the second quarter. We look forward to developing this major partnership with Wynn and rolling that nationally, including in Nevada, where we will be both their PAM and their sports tech provider across retail and online channels. GAN is now licensed in 18 U.S. states and we ultimately expect GAN Sports to be operational in every license U.S. jurisdiction. In Nevada, we continue to work through the licensing process. Moving to Coolbet's growth in Latin America. It's clear that our strong performance during the World Cup has allowed us to grow our presence in these markets. We saw strong KPIs this quarter with new customer growth of over 10%, continued low customer acquisition costs and encouraging but still very early initial metrics out of our recent entry into the Mexican market. Finally, our largest LatAm market had a record April in net gaming revenue, partly driven by a new soccer team sponsorship, which appears to be delivering ahead of expectations in a toughening competitive climate. We will continue fine-tuning marketing capital spend to the highest return regions throughout Latin America. To illustrate this point, we clearly exited the B2C market from Ontario, Canada in order to shift marketing capital deployed at a 12-month rate of return to a 6-month or faster rate of return in Latin American markets. Finally, our new platform or GameSTACK 2.0, which combines the best elements of our existing platform and Coolbet's technology, is progressing well. All of our new real money B2B gambling clients will be launched on GameSTACK 2.0, which will result in greater functionality for the operators and conservatively result in $10 million in annual cash savings. I'll now turn the call over to our Interim Chief Financial Officer, Brian Chang, to provide more color on financial and accounting items, and then I'll conclude with additional color on strategy and the strategic review process. Brian, over to you.Story continuesBrian ChangThank you, Dermot, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we discuss our quarterly results, I wanted to provide some more details on our amended credit facility as well as the amendment to our Ainsworth agreement, each of which were executed as part of the first phases of our strategic review. We believe these changes were truly a great outcome for GAN and its stakeholders. As a result of the amendment to our credit facility, we were able to secure waivers for all potential events of default and amended certain financial covenants and we are very pleased to report that we are now fully in compliance with all of our financial covenants. Our new interest rate is fixed at 8% compared to our prior rate that was variable based on SOFR, which was effectively 15.5% in the prior year quarter. In addition to lower fixed interest rate, our interest rate is paid in kind, otherwise known as PIK interest, which allows us to defer any cash interest until the maturity of the loan. While we will still recognize interest expense through our P&amp;L, there will be no cash outflows until maturity. We estimate this will result in $4 million annual savings and cash interest. Related to our agreement with Ainsworth, as Dermot noted, we reduced our future cash commitments by $15 million or $5 million on an annual basis in exchange for an equity stake in the company of 1.25 million shares. This will modestly increase our share count from 42.6 million to approximately 43.8 million. As a result of this amendment, we recognized a $9.2 million gain in the quarter that is recorded in other income that significantly contributed to the reported net income this quarter of $1.5 million. From a cash perspective, the amendments to our credit facility and Ainsworth agreements will lead to a reduced cash outflows of approximately $9 million per year. Moving on to the quarter. B2B revenues were $8.6 million versus $10.7 million in the prior year period. This is primarily attributable to a decrease in our take rate as described earlier. For expenses, our capitalized development run rates have been adjusted, which added approximately $1.5 million of expenses to our P&amp;L, but did not impact free cash flow. We also note that FX in the quarter did not materially impact us as the majority of our foreign revenues and expenses are aligned and constant currency exposure was a loss on earnings. Lastly, we ended the quarter with $40.8 million in cash, down from $45.9 million as of year-end, driven primarily from changes in working capital. Our cash balance at the end of April approximated our year-end balance. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Dermot.Dermot Stopford SmurfitThank you, Brian. As we mentioned last quarter, we initiated a formal strategic review process that continues to progress at a good pace. Importantly, we've already executed 3 distinct initial steps year-to-date, and I'll provide more color on the 2 most important of those steps. The amended Ainsworth exclusive iGaming content distribution partnership reduces our future cash commitments by $15 million, and our successful refinancing transaction provides for much greater financial flexibility and approximately $4 million in reduced annual cash outflows over the next few years. While each of these steps are immensely positive in isolation, the strategic review continues forward, and we will update the market when appropriate. As we go through the process, our collective belief remains unshaken that there is significant unrealized value in our proprietary technology offerings that encompasses omnichannel sports, PAM and leading iGaming aggregation, our patented IP and a growing profitable B2C business. We are unable to provide forward guidance at this time given the nature of our strategic review process, and as a result, the variability of potential outcomes prevents us from providing an outlook within a reasonable range. Although we expect to be in a position to provide guidance for the year upon the resolution of these discussions, hopefully, in the near future. To wrap up, I'm confident in our go-forward strategy to drive revenue growth with B2B sports and B2C growth in LatAm. We are taking a more simplified and focused approach to how we allocate our capital and resources. We are, in fact, in the very early innings of the rollout of GAN Sports. And at this time next year, of course, subject to regulatory approvals, we expect that GAN sports will be operational with marquee clients across the biggest U.S. gaming markets. This past quarter, we made strong strides to shore up our balance sheet, providing financial flexibility to profitably grow our business. Finally, we are moving at a good pace on our strategic review process designed to deliver incremental value for shareholders, and we will update the market when appropriate. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ryan Sigdahl of Craig Hallum Capital Group.Ryan Ronald SigdahlI want to start -- so you guided for Q1 one day before quarter end on March 30, and you missed the low end by $2 million. So I guess curious what happened from then until now?Dermot Stopford SmurfitYes. Brian, look, I'll take that. So we have continuing commercial discussions with some, if not all of our B2B clients on a continuing basis. We had multiple conversations where we were seeking incremental economic value from our B2B clients throughout the duration of the first quarter. And we had some wins, and we had some that continued in negotiation stage through into the second quarter. So you're right to call it out. We didn't get things closed in time.Ryan Ronald SigdahlSo I guess does that imply a retrospective renegotiation? I guess I still don't quite follow given the quarter is almost over.Dermot Stopford SmurfitWell, just to give you an illustration, right? We actually signed a -- our definitive material agreement with one of our clients on literally the last day of the quarter, so it's very hard to predict these things. And there's obviously a rush which our clients sometimes know all about as you approach the end of the quarter. So you have to be quite strategic about the decisions you make and the timing of those decisions.Ryan Ronald SigdahlGot you. As it relates to that largest B2B customer, what was the new rate? How does that compare to your old rate?Dermot Stopford SmurfitI mean, Ryan, we're not disclosing anything to do with our specific individual customer contracts. That's just a byproduct of the strategic review, and I'll just politely decline to answer at this point.Ryan Ronald SigdahlI guess it -- okay. It's really hard to forecast this business going forward, given $3 million to $4 million delta in Q1 and not knowing those changes in the contract terms going forward with, by far, your most important, about 1/3 of that B2B business. So any help. I guess, maybe I'll ask one other a different way, do you expect more or less revenue from that customer this year?Dermot Stopford SmurfitAgain, in the round under the strategic review process, we really can't comment at this point. I mean, we're very happy with the direction of travel with our B2B division in GAN Sports through the balance of this year, and we see significant growth in adoption rates and demand. Now that we've got GAN Sports fully deployed in the U.S., in Massachusetts, both online and retail, which is a key inflection point for customers, making commitments to our business. So again, hard to be specific in the questions, and I accept and understand the frustration.OperatorYour next question comes from Chad Beynon of Macquarie.Chad C. BeynonFirst on Coolbet. Dermot, I believe you said that revenues were up on a constant currency basis. Can you talk about kind of, a, where the business is in Mexico, the opportunity, if you're still as excited as you were previously in terms of what this could mean for the business? And then secondly, can you kind of dive in a little bit further into markets where you're seeing growth, understanding that you exited Ontario. Just trying to get a better sense of what's going on kind of deep in the Coolbet markets.Dermot Stopford SmurfitNo problem at all, Chad. Thanks for the question. Yes, the B2C division, as I said on the call, we entered the second quarter with great run rate, great growth, all-time record NGR and activity. Very, very happy with the byproduct results of major soccer club sponsorship activity that started onrolling at the very end of the first quarter and into April. So very positive indications of growth there in Latin America. The growth is centered around Latin America. We are still excited about Mexico. It's been perhaps a little bit slower out of the gate than we anticipated at the very beginning of this year, but the early indications are positive. As with all new market entries, you have to be very, very patient and optimize the conversion funnel to new depositing players before you start allocating significant amounts of marketing capital. So we're going to continue to optimize the product, but the product itself, coolbet.com, has been extremely well received in all the Latin American markets that it's rolled out into, and we expect and anticipate the same team will continue to achieve market penetration and market growth rates in the Mexican regulated market, which will align with our previous experiences in that particular region. So very excited about the B2C division and the return to growth prospects after a relatively pedestrian growth performance in 2022, which is behind our expectations. But the indicators in the current quarter, and looking forward through the year, are very positive.Chad C. BeynonGreat. And then on GAN Sports, can you help us just kind of think about how long it takes to get a customer up and running, really just kind of adoption rates? The reason why I'm asking it is when would we need to hear about new contract launches to be live ahead of NFL season, which is obviously the biggest contributor for most B2C operators. Is there anything -- any big contracts that are coming up, opportunities there? And when would we need to hear something to have contribution for 2023?Dermot Stopford SmurfitWell, for '23, it's really a rollout deployment story for Wynn Resorts nationwide. We have a very large number of markets going live this summer for Wynn Resorts, which is very exciting. We also have the -- and this is very much subject to successful conclusion of the licensing and certification process in Nevada, which is seriously complex as an undertaking the summer launch for station casinos. I think that's going to be a massive and highly impactful industry-wide shift in the tectonic plates of vendor infrastructure provision in major gaming markets. So we're super excited to get that out. The first early indicator of that was really the very positive reception by our client, Wynn Resorts, and a lot of other people in the industry paying attention to the rollout by GAN of GAN Sports for Wynn Resorts in Massachusetts, not just the very fast rollout of retail, but the day 1 successful launch of online sports for Wynn in Massachusetts on March 10 in the first quarter. So super positive rollout. It was weeks, not months to get the retail operation stood up, which is super exciting. Retail scales and deploys very, very effectively and very well in states where we are licensed. Other states, any new states where licensing cycles are required or technical certification requirements are slightly different, which they tend to be from state to state, can be a multi-month cycle, but we do anticipate significant new B2B clients of GAN Sports as we progress through the balance of '23.Chad C. BeynonAnd then one last housekeeping one. Brian, you mentioned that after the Ainsworth conversion, you're at 43.8 million for shares. The diluted number was larger than that in the press release. Can you give us the end of the quarter or current fully diluted number with all the warrants options?Brian ChangI believe that we should be around 47 million. We have obviously the effect of options, the Ainsworth and our RSUs that have invested that would make up that delta.OperatorAt this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Dermot Smurfit for any closing remarks.Dermot Stopford SmurfitThank you, operator, and thank you, of course, to everyone for joining this afternoon's call. From here, we will lean hard into GAN Sports in the U.S. and selected international markets for B2C, where we are best positioned and see clearly attainable path to profitability. I remain excited about the opportunity ahead of us, and I'm confident we have the right team and plan to execute from here. Thank you all.OperatorThis concludes today's presentation. Thank you, everyone, for attending.]"

One ""tool in the toolkit"" is the purchase and use of carbon offsets, allowing organizations to offset their greenhouse gas emissions by supporting a variety of sustainable projects.What are voluntary carbon offsets?Voluntary carbon offsets are an instrument organizations can purchase to support projects around the globe to either reduce emissions entering the atmosphere or remove carbon dioxide (CO2). These offsets are generated from a wide variety of sustainable projects, such as wind and solar farms, reforestation initiatives and other nature-based solutions, energy efficiency measures, as well as harmful industrial process reduction technologies. The goal of these projects is to reduce the amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases that are released into the atmosphere, either through avoiding emissions or through direct removal of CO2. Voluntary carbon offsets are called ""voluntary"" because they are not required by law but are instead purchased by organizations to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and reduce their impact on the environment.Types of voluntary carbon offsetsThere are several types of voluntary carbon offsets available, each with its own specific focus and benefits. Some of the most common types of carbon offsets and related sustainable projects are:Renewable Energy Offsets include wind and solar farms, hydroelectric dams, biomass energy and landfill gas to power facilities. The purchase of carbon offsets from these facilities can ensure that the projects receive the financing needed for construction and operation.Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) support activities like planting trees in degraded areas (reforestation and afforestation), paying stakeholders to not cut down trees (avoided deforestation), improved forest management (sustainable forestry practices), agricultural soil carbon sequestration, and wetlands restoration.Energy efficiency technologies include upgrading energy-efficient lighting and or HVAC systems, improving building insulation, and replacing outdated and inefficient appliances.Industrial processes typically refer to the capture and destruction of methane and other ozone depleting substances (ODS). Various industrial sectors use ODS in refrigeration, air conditioning, and the production of insulating foam and cushioning.Story continuesWhy is carbon offsetting important?Large, sophisticated businesses and organizations are among the largest emitters of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. By reducing their carbon emissions, they can better meet sustainability goals while also improving their brand reputation and appeal to customers, employees, and other stakeholders who are concerned about the environment. Demonstrating a commitment to sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint, organizations can distinguish themselves from their competitors.With several different types of carbon offsets available, organizations can choose the type that best fits their needs and goals and demonstrate their commitment to sustainability in a meaningful and impactful way. Stay tuned, next I'll explore how carbon offset projects are evaluated to ensure they are a true solution in the fight against climate change.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from NRG Energy on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: NRG EnergyWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/nrg-energyEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: NRG EnergyView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/754046/Understanding-Carbon-Offsets]"

108,e66a036a-0172-374c-a98d-80df7b1a72e1,MA,2023-05-11,"Mastercard Economics Institute Releases Travel Industry Trends 2023: Mainland China Re-Opens, Experiences Endure, and Business Travel Bounces Back",Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-economics-institute-releases-travel-040100765.html,1683777660,STORY,['MA'],"[PURCHASE, N.Y., May 11, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--New insights from the Mastercard Economics Institute reveal that consumers are taking advantage of a more traditional travel ecosystem in 2023, prioritizing leisure travel and pioneering new corridors around the world. Released today, Travel Industry Trends 2023 delivers key insights about the global state of travel, punctuated by shifting economic landscapes, persistent consumer demands, and a reopening of mainland China.In the face of a changing economic landscape, post-pandemic preferences for experiences over things1 and a consistent demand for leisure travel shape the 2023 outlook. Initially lagging leisure travel, business travel found its footing in the latter half of 2022, especially in cultures prioritizing a return to office. With an uncertain economy providing some cross-market turbulence, mainland China’s reopening is expected to bolster growth globally with concentrated impact in Asia Pacific, according to Mastercard Economics Institute estimates.Key findings include:Leisure and business travel are growing at the same pace. Global leisure travel remains robust, with flight bookings up roughly 31% in March 2023 compared to the same month in 2019.2 In the second half of 2022 into early 2023, corporate flight bookings caught up to leisure flight bookings driven by regions with a strong return to office culture.3 Global leisure and business travel are now growing at similar rates. Our insights show demand for in-person meetings, with the most significant growth in commercial travel and entertainment expenses being led by Asia Pacific and Europe up 64% and 42%, respectively, between January-March 2023.4Mainland China’s reopening benefits global and Asia Pacific tourism. China’s reopening following tight COVID regulations comes at a time when it will likely have a positive impact on the experience economy as pent-up demand for travel is expected to drive strong tailwinds. By March 2023, spending on experiences was notably 93% of where it was in 2019 despite minimal travel last year.6 Economies in the Asia Pacific region could be obvious beneficiaries of China's opening, given their strong ties to international trade, tourism, and geographical proximity. Based on Mastercard Economics Institute estimates, other countries that are expected to benefit include northern Europe – Germany and France – and Brazil, which could see a boost in their exports to China as the economy recovers.Travelers establish new corridors. As consumers are enjoying higher incomes and returning to some level of pre-pandemic comfort, they’re also starting to venture further from home to new locations. Germany and Spain are becoming more popular for Latin American travelers, while Saudi Arabia and Egypt have become popular destinations for travelers from Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The U.S., previously ranked as number 5 in the top destinations for European travelers in 2022, now ranks number 4, signaling a building desire to explore across the pond7. Traditionally tourism-driven European countries like France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece could disproportionately benefit from resilient global tourists.Tourists continue to prioritize experiences. Preference for experiences over things persists, and travelers are demonstrating new demand for the unique. Potentially influenced by social media and entertainment, travelers are landing in lesser-known destinations in search of cultural immersion. As of March 2023, global spending on experiences was up 65% while spending on things is up 12% compared to 2019.8 Experience-oriented spending is surging in certain corridors where pandemic lockdowns have expired, but Chinese tourists who traditionally over-index on luxury retail compared to other tourists could provide a boost to goods spending across markets.Story continues""In the first full year of unfettered travel since the pandemic, consumers are acting on pent-up desire to explore new locales, connect with friends and family, and accumulate experiences to make up for lost time,"" said Bricklin Dwyer, Mastercard chief economist and head of the Mastercard Economics Institute. ""Despite evolving economic landscapes, resilient consumers continue to prioritize travel. And with new corridors emerging and China reopening, the 2023 outlook indicates good reason to be optimistic.""Comprehensive Support to Travelers &amp; Tourism SectorTravelers want a good experience from the time they book their plane ticket to their first step on new soil, and companies that understand that are better positioned to establish longer and more valuable relationships with their consumers. This key shift in expectations has already started to change not only how companies work with their consumers, but also the way in which we travel. And though consumer behavior will continue to shift alongside the macroeconomic environment, providing more choice in how to pay (like redeeming points for bookings), and tailoring experiences, recommendations, and offers are just two strategies that keep the individual traveler at the center of engagement.Mastercard is dedicated to helping the global tourism sector recover and welcome travelers through a range of services, from market analysis and high-frequency data insights that help make sense of changing consumer trends to marketing solutions and consumer engagement strategies that drive brand loyalty and maximize bookings.You can view the full Travel Industry Trends 2023 report here.

As one of the world's leading wireless technology innovators, we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible across devices and networks to enable next-generation experiences and drive digital transformation.We design platforms, chipsets, software, tools and services that help OEMs and developers bring those technologies into products and create experiences that change how we live and work. And we do this at scale, building technologically advanced, in-demand end products that support everything from low- to high-complexity devices - helping us serve virtually every industry at the connected intelligent edge.5G LeadershipOur innovations are driving the 5G standards and the benefits that define 5G, including speed, responsiveness, reliability and capacity. Our products are accelerating the expansion of 5G, and our work behind the scenes is enabling the growth of the broader 5G ecosystem. In addition to consumer applications, such as smartphones, 5G is also bringing increased efficiency across industries, enterprises and educational institutions.And now, with 5G Advanced, we are entering the second phase of the 5G decade, bringing a new wave of wireless technology innovations. 5G Advanced will incorporate machine learning to customize performance to varied deployment and application scenarios, including scalable deployments of XR to power remote work, remote education and other economically transformative applications. We're continuing to lead the industry in 5G Advanced with our unique expertise that spans connectivity, multimedia, AI and computing technologies.Looking into the longer-term future, we're also leading research into foundational technologies for 6G to realize the full benefit of emerging trends in cloud computing, spectrum sharing and machine learning. We believe that the convergence of the physical, digital and virtual worlds in 6G will enable new and transformative use cases across numerous industries, deliver next-generation experiences and continue to address societal, sustainability and economic challenges into the next decade.Story continuesSome examples of the societal benefits of 5G are provided below.Digital Transformations for a Sustainable WorldLike the Internet and electricity, 5G serves as a foundation to connect everything, helping to develop a more resilient, equitable and sustainable society. Building on our broad technology portfolio, we're at the intersection of transformative trends that are creating new and diverse opportunities for promoting sustainability across industries. Our help solutions improve efficiency, enable enhanced capabilities, improve safety and equity, create jobs and much more.Enabling a more reliable, resilient and sustainable gridQualcomm is helping to enable the digital transformation of the energy industry to create a more modern, resilient and sustainable grid. Our smart sensors, smart meters and edge gateways offer electric utilities cost- and power-efficient solutions for the monitoring of grid assets and management of decentralized resources, enabling faster decision making for improved reliability and energy efficiency. Using the power of the connected intelligent edge, network infrastructure is deployed without costly infrastructure upgrades, while security, reliability and resiliency are enhanced. We help utilities and their customers increase the efficiency of power distribution and consumption and integrate renewable energy resources. While preparing for the electrification of everything, 5G, which offers faster data transfer, higher reliability and lower latency, can help utilities accelerate their transition to a more sustainable grid with cleaner energy to better serve their communities.Creating safer and more efficient transportationQualcomm® CellularVehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) solutions, which include vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) and vehicle-to-network (V2N) communication, can complement use of 5G networks and provide direct communications connectivity for low-latency, safety-critical and mobility-benefiting applications. Together, these technologies can increase safety and equity for vehicle passengers and vulnerable road users and advance sustainability.Connected transportation systems are designed to support new roadside and driver services that mitigate roadway incidents and improve trip planning, transportation mode choice and traffic efficiency - enhancements that also lower emissions and reduce fuel consumption. Examples include real-time route guidance to bypass congestion, adjusting vehicle dynamics for optimal speed with less braking and idling for lower emissions and fuel use and personal mobility services for additional travel options. With wide-scale market penetration, the annual environmental impact of C-V2X could be equivalent to more than 46 million acres of U.S. forests sequestering carbon10.C-V2X applications can improve safety and travel mode options for vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and pedal cyclists in underserved communities who are disproportionately impacted by fatalities in both urban and rural areas. Cyclist fatality rates are 23 percent higher for Latinos and 30 percent higher for African Americans11. Low-income, Black and Latino communities also have higher vehicular traffic volumes, trucking routes, major arterial roads, intersections that are unsafe or impassable by foot or bike and an overall lower level and quality of walking and cycling infrastructure12. In addition to preventing collisions for enhanced safety, information exchanged between road users and infrastructure can also inform mobility-on-demand to increase transportation equity in these communities. In rural areas, the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled is 2 times higher than in urban areas13; and the lack of connectivity to support emergency response could be a major cause of rural deaths. Complementary network coverage on rural roads is key to addressing these challenges.Vehicles equipped with connectivity can communicate with their surroundings to enhance safety for road users. Connected vehicles communicate safety information to reduce road incidents and potentially save lives - a notable example involves providing emergency vehicles the ability to pre-empt traffic signals as they approach, turning them green while also alerting surrounding vehicles of their approach, providing them with advanced notice to safely move out of the way. Connectivity also benefits automated vehicles, such as allowing a robotaxi to communicate with passengers and emergency responders in the event of a malfunctioning vehicle. In circumstances where automated vehicles are unable to understand their environment and make decisions, connectivity also allows for remote driving to support continued operation. Vehicles used for last mile deliveries also benefit from connectivity when operating in restricted areas with low mobility. In addition to cellular networks, satellite connectivity can provide communication in a multitude of scenarios to support safer roads everywhere.Addressing the digital divideWith 37 percent14 of the world population still offline, people without broadband Internet connectivity are cut off from information and opportunities, including access to work, education and healthcare. 5G Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) and mobile broadband can provide improved connectivity and affordability and help to narrow the digital divide. Our pioneering work in millimeter wave and devices with large antenna counts allows FWA technology to meet today's challenging customer needs.5G FWA can be up to 80 percent less expensive than fiber to deploy15, improving its affordability, especially in developing and emerging countries. It has already been launched in 45 countries or territories by 83 operators16. If deployed fully, FWA could provide home Internet access for the first time to 850 million people around the world within the next decade16. This would almost close the home Internet divide in high-income countries and connect the homes of 750 million people in emerging and developing countries16. As connectivity facilitates access to work, income, information, markets and services, this holds the potential to facilitate global economic growth in 2023.Power EfficiencyAs each generation of device gets ""smarter"" more power is typically required. The additional power must be drawn from a device's relatively small battery. Mitigating this energy challenge has always been a chief focus at our Company, and commitment to power efficiency runs deep in our Snapdragon Platforms.We expect on average of 10 percent days-of-use power reduction year over year in our Snapdragon premium-tier chipset from 2021 to 2025. In particular, we improved the 5G modem power by 20 percent from Snapdragon 8 Gen1 in 2021 to Snapdragon 8 Gen2 in 2022. The efficiency and power-savings advances in each processor functional block add up to considerable potential battery run time savings.We are leveraging our strong foundation in building power-efficient smartphone devices into all our product categories. Our solutions for AI, vehicular autonomy and network infrastructure each have leading performance for power consumption.In addition to fostering power efficiency for mobile devices, we are collaborating with wireless network and service providers in creating technologies targeting improved power efficiency in communication networks, thereby enabling greener wireless communications.Learn more in Qualcomm's 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report10 C-V2X: A new era of smart transportation in the United States11 The New Majority: Pedaling Towards Equity 12 Neighborhood Social Inequalities in Road Traffic Injuries: The Influence of Traffic Volume and Road Design 13 Rural/Urban Comparison of Motor Vehicle Traffic Fatalities 14 International Telecommunication Union, 2021 15 GSMA (2022) The 5G FWA opportunity A TCO model for a 5G mmWave FWA network; GSMA (2022) The 5G FWA opportunity: a TCO model for a 5G FWA network using mid-band plus mmWave 116 5G and the Digital DivideQualcomm, Wednesday, May 10, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Qualcomm on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: QualcommWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/qualcommEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: QualcommView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/753997/Qualcomms-Approach-to-Breakthrough-Inventions]"

Source: Dennis Schaal/SkiftExpedia Group has been at the forefront of the travel industry in releasing two generative AI tools for trip planning. Chairman Barry Diller claimed the company had a head start because of its ties with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.An independent director, Altman has been on the Expedia Group board of directors since September 2019.Addressing what he described as “the topic of the second,” artificial intelligence, at an Expedia Group partner conference at its Seattle headquarters Tuesday, Diller claimed that months before ChatGPT’s public release, Altman demonstrated the chatbot’s capabilities at an event for one of “our companies.”Diller said this show and tell took place in November 2022. It presumably happened at an event for one of his IAC brands because other Expedia officials confirmed that this didn’t take place at an Expedia event. Diller is the senior executive and chairman at both Expedia Group and IAC.Diller said they had asked ChatGPT to describe the relationship between Diller and his wife Diane von Furstenberg, and how they met.He quipped the chatbot answered with a “somewhat salacious description” because he and his wife have a “history.”Diller said he was dumbstruck and scared by the demo, but also wowed.He claimed Expedia, therefore, started working on ChatGPT “before anyone else,” and the Altman connection helped Expedia become “front-footed” in utilizing generative AI.Starting in April, Expedia’s iOS app users could use its ChatGPT-based bot for help in trip planning, and they get answers along with a potential hotel or trip idea. A month earlier, Expedia — along with Booking Holdings’ Kayak and OpenTable — debuted OpenAI plug-ins for ChatGPT.It’s unclear whether Expedia actually had any inside information about ChatGPT from Altman. OpenAI released ChatGPT last November, the same month Diller said Altman gave a demo of it at an event for one of his companies.In an interview later in the day Tuesday, Expedia Group CEO Peter Kern said Altman talked about ChatGPT with other board members, but he didn’t reveal anything that he hadn’t already made public.Story continuesOpenAI didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about Diller’s remarks.Toward the end of Expedia’s partner event Tuesday, NYU professor and podcaster Scott Galloway gave a talk and recommended that Expedia should blow up its earnings and spend millions of dollars marketing the fact that it is a travel industry leader in generative AI.Galloway follows tech developments keenly and said he didn’t realize that Expedia was a leader in the space. A couple of companies in each industry will emerge as AI leaders, and Expedia would be missing an opportunity if it didn’t create awareness about its initiatives in AI, he said.In other remarks, Diller discussed his previously articulated opposition to the work-from-home trend, although other Expedia officials overruled him to some extent on the subject. Expedia employees generally come into the office a few days per week.Diller called work from home “its own kind of pandemic.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

In addition, it says that price negotiations for small molecule drugs (such as pills) can begin nine years after they reach market and large molecule drugs (such as injectables) can begin after 13 years on the market.""What that's going to do over time is shift capital away from these medicines. There are many diseases you can only treat with small molecule drugs,"" Narasimhan said in an interview with Yahoo Finance Tuesday.It's something Eli Lilly's chief scientist recently noted as well, saying that, ""Both small and large molecule medicines need at least 13 years before they come under the Medicare price control regime or incentives to pursue risky research into precision medicine will evaporate.""But Narasimhan added that since the IRA provisions won't be implemented until 2025, there may be time to address his concerns with Medicare officials.Meanwhile, the European Union is considering compulsory licensing during emergencies, such as the COVID pandemic, which would require companies to share their drug formulas. The drug industry fought against global attempts to share their vaccine and treatment recipes. Some agreed not to enforce patents, but also didn't provide resources for interested parties to gain the knowledge needed to actually produce the products.Story continues""They have to create the right innovation ecosystem,"" Narasimhan said of Europe's rule proposal.""If they erode patent protections, in even small ways, it just erodes the ability for us to invest in that region,"" he said.Medical bottles and syringe are seen with Novartis logo displayed on a screen in the background in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on November 10, 2022.

This decline can be attributed to a decrease in deliveries of AV7909 and BioThrax to the U.S. government’s Strategic National Stockpile.Narcan (naloxone HCl) nasal spray added $100 million to product sales, up 8% year over year. This rise was likely due to higher volumes of Narcan sprays sold to public customers in Canada.Sales of smallpox vaccine totaled $7.2 million, down 69% from the year-ago-quarter’s level, due to the timing of ACAM2000 international sales.Other product sales amounted to $13.9 million, up 23% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by higher Vivotif and Vaxchora product sales.Revenues from contracts and grants plunged 32% year over year to $6.5 million.Total CDMO revenues came in at $15.2 million compared with $60.8 million in the prior-year period. CDMO services revenues declined 74% year over year to $13.4 million. CDMO lease revenues totaled $1.8 million, indicating a substantial decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $9 million.Story continuesThis significant decline was due to negligible combined revenues from AstraZeneca AZN and Janssen, a Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ subsidiary.In July 2020, J&amp;J and Emergent entered into an agreement to provide CDMO services for J&amp;J’s single-shot, adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine for five years. In June 2022, the companies announced their decision to terminate the deal, citing contract breaches.The decline in CDMO lease revenues was largely due to a reduction of lease revenues related to the Janssen contract termination.Emergent suffered a setback in 2021 due to a manufacturing mishap at its Bayview facility. Reportedly, the COVID-19 vaccine ingredients of J&amp;J and AstraZeneca got mixed at the facility, which led to several faulty batches of J&amp;J’s vaccine. Emergent lost its contract for AstraZeneca’s vaccine following the mishap.2023 GuidanceEmergent has updated its guidance for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and net loss. The company also revised the categories used in discussing product/service level revenues.Projection for total revenues remains unchanged in the $1,100-$1,200 million range.

It also projects an adjusted net loss of $85-$35 million compared with the previous guidance of a loss of $80-$30 million.Adjusted gross margin is expected between 39% and 42% (earlier estimate: 41-44%).Management expects Anthrax Medical Counter measures (Anthrax MCM) sales — comprising AV7909, BioThrax, Anthrasil and raxibacumab — in the range of $260-$280 million. Revenues from the Narcan nasal spray are expected in the band of $360-$380 million (previously $290-$310 million).Product sales from Smallpox MCM (comprising ACAM2000, Vigiv and Tembexa) are expected to add $235-$255 million to total revenues. EBS expects revenues of $120-$140 million (previously $165-$185 million) from other products.It projects CDMO revenues in the range of $90-$110 million compared with the previous guidance of $115-$135 million.Emergent Biosolutions Inc.

118,81e0c49c-2bb5-3e0f-b18c-a5dd78e69bca,JNJ,2023-05-11,States With the Lowest to Highest Capital Gains Tax Rate,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/states-lowest-highest-capital-gains-133037447.html,1683725437,STORY,"['ABBV', 'JNJ']","[In this article, we will take a look at states with the lowest to highest capital gains tax rates. You can skip our detailed analysis of capital gains taxes and the overall tax structure of different states, and go directly to read 10 States With the Lowest to Highest Capital Gains Tax Rate. Capital gains tax is imposed on the profits or gains earned from the sale or disposal of certain types of assets known as capital assets. These assets include stocks, bonds, real estate properties, precious metals, and other investments held for a specific period of time. Capital gains can not be earned as an employee or from a business but are received due to the increase in value of an investment. For this reason, they are taxed differently than regular income. Capital gains can be either short-term or long-term, depending on how long the asset was held before it was sold.Short-term capital gains occur when an asset is held for one year or less before being sold. They are taxed at the same rates as your ordinary income tax rates, which can be up to 37%. This mainly depends on one’s income level and tax bracket. Long-term capital gains, on the other hand, apply to assets held for more than one year before being sold. The tax rates for long-term capital gains are determined based on income level and filing status and are comparatively lower than short-term capital gains. The highest long-term capital gains tax rate is 20% but can either be 0% or 15% depending on income. According to Charles Schwab, the maximum long-term capital gains rate rose to nearly 40% in the late 1970s for investors with bigger gains.Long-term capital gains are also applied to qualified dividends. This means that if dividend-paying investments are held for more than a specified holding period, the payouts received may be subject to lower long-term capital gains tax rates. So, profits from the sales of dividend stocks like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are subject to capital gains taxes.Story continuesOver the years, capital gains realizations have fluctuated, reaching their 40-year high of over $2 trillion in 2021 and representing 8.7% of GDP, according to data from Congressional Budget Office. However, the federal agency forecasts realizations to revert to about 3.7% of GDP over the next 10 years. The report also mentioned that approximately 7.3% of individual income tax revenues are expected to come from capital gains realizations in the fiscal year 2033.In one of the recent developments, the current administration in the US has proposed an increase in the capital gains tax rate. As mentioned above, the highest capital gains tax rate is 20%, which could be increased to 39.6% for people earning at least $1 million, as reported by CNBC. This increase in the tax rate could significantly impact high-income earners who make a considerable profit from the sale of assets. The change in the tax rate could also discourage investors from selling their assets, which could impact the liquidity of the market.These proposed changes in capital gains could also impact business owners who are planning to sell their businesses. The higher tax rate could reduce the amount of profit they make from the sale, which could impact their retirement plans or their ability to invest in other ventures. This is one of the main reasons why people avoid capital gains taxes. The higher the tax rate on capital gains, the less money they get to keep from their investments.In addition to lower profits, taxpayers avoid capital gains taxes to preserve cash flow and rebalance their investments. For these reasons, individuals should consider utilizing tax-advantaged accounts such as individual retirement accounts (IRAs) or 401(k) plans, as contributions in these accounts may be tax-deductible. Moreover, investors should hold investments for the long term because long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates.Individuals who are concerned about high tax burdens, including capital gains taxes, may consider relocating to states that offer more favorable tax environments. For instance, California is one of the country’s most expensive states to live in, which has seen a decline in its population for over 30 years now. According to a report by CNBC, over 360,000 people left California in 2021 for states offering lower taxes. Moreover, California and New York also lost over $90 billion in income during the Covid pandemic.Many states like Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming do not have taxes on capital gains.

The specialized tread compound that provides enhanced all-season traction will include Monolith carbon black produced by methane pyrolysis. In doing so, Monolith and Goodyear are taking the next step on a journey toward zero-emissions carbon black in tire manufacturing.Goodyear announces industry's first tire to use carbon black produced via methane pyrolysis. The tire tread in a select size of the Goodyear ElectricDrive™ GT will include Monolith carbon black.This tire, which will be manufactured with this specific carbon black, is the first tire for sale in the industry to have this type of carbon black produced by Monolith.Carbon black is a key ingredient in tires, providing compounds in the tires with strength, improved tear resistance, and increased abrasion resistance. While traditional carbon black commonly comes from the combustion of fossil fuel oils, Monolith's plasma-based process takes advantage of renewable electricity to complete methane pyrolysis and results in the output of only carbon and hydrogen, with no combustion required. Methane pyrolysis allows for the splitting of the methane molecule into the constituent elements—carbon and hydrogen.""At Goodyear, we are continually looking at and working with our supply base to understand and discover new innovations and technologies to use in our products,"" said Chris Helsel, senior vice president Global Operations, and Chief Technology Officer. ""The use of carbon black produced by methane pyrolysis is an example of how we are collaborating with our suppliers, like Monolith, to utilize sustainable materials in our consumer products, without compromising on performance and safety.""""Working with innovative partners to incorporate sustainable ingredients is at the core of what we do, and Goodyear has been at the forefront of that mission,"" said Rob Hanson, cofounder and CEO, Monolith. ""We're thrilled for the tire made with Monolith carbon black to launch and excited for the continued product research and development in this industry-leading partnership.""Story continuesThe Goodyear ElectricDrive GT delivers long-lasting tread wear and a quiet ride for EV drivers and passengers. The ElectricDrive GT features Goodyear's SoundComfort Technology®, which acts as a built-in sound barrier that helps reduce road noise. The ElectricDrive GT 235/40R19 is available through Goodyear.com and is an ideal fit for vehicles such as the Tesla Model 3.Goodyear plans to explore expanding the use of Monolith carbon black produced via methane pyrolysis across additional product lines in the coming years. Goodyear also plans to continue to investigate with Monolith the potential use of new technologies, such as the use of carbon black produced from methane derived from waste sources.Goodyear entered into a collaboration agreement with Monolith, a world leader in clean hydrogen and materials production, in December 2021 for the development and potential use of carbon black produced from methane and/or biomethane for its tires.Goodyear defines a sustainable material as a bio-based/renewable, recycled material or one that may be produced using or contributing to other sustainable practices for resource conservation and/or emissions reductions including mass-balance materials.

But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) shareholders, since the share price is down 35% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 50%. Even worse, it's down 8.8% in about a month, which isn't fun at all. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders, they're still in the red over the last three years, so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline. View our latest analysis for Illumina While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over the three years that the share price declined, Illumina's earnings per share (EPS) dropped significantly, falling to a loss. Due to the loss, it's not easy to use EPS as a reliable guide to the business. However, we can say we'd expect to see a falling share price in this scenario.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 6.3% in the last year, Illumina shareholders lost 1.7%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. However, the loss over the last year isn't as bad as the 4% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. We would want clear information suggesting the company will grow, before taking the view that the share price will stabilize.

Both sides blame each other for high drug prices.Testifying on Wednesday were the CEOs of major insulin manufacturers Eli Lilly and Co, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi, which together control 90% of the U.S. market, and top PBM executives from CVS Health Corp, Cigna Group's Express Scripts, and UnitedHealth Group Inc's Optum RX, which control 80% of the prescription drug market.""Why, in the richest country on Earth, do 1.3 million Americans ration insulin because of the cost? Why are 1 out of 4 Americans not able to afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe?"" asked Senator Bernie Sanders, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee.The Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi CEOs all said drugmakers pay substantial rebates aimed at lowering costs but that PBMs and insurers are incentivized to choose drugs with higher prices because they lead to larger rebates.""Higher list prices allow for higher fees and rebates, which can increase patients out of pocket costs while benefiting employers, insurance companies and people who don't use medicines,"" Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said.PBM executives said manufacturers alone set the drug prices and abuse patent protections to stifle competition. Drug costs would be even higher without the rebates that PBMs negotiate for their customers, Optum Rx CEO Heather Cianfrocco said.""They count on us to be a counterweight to the substantial market power of manufacturers, which have the sole discretion in setting and raising prices for their products,"" she said.Story continuesThe Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi CEOs pointed to their companies cutting list prices by more than 70% for some insulin products in March and said they hoped to provide insulin to more customers a year from now.The cuts could help around 2 million people pay for insulin. Although many people, including some 3.3 million on Medicare, pay $35 a month or less, about 1-in-5 with private insurance and the 17% of insulin users who are uninsured stand to benefit.Uninsured people often have to pay full list prices, an average of $900 a month, forcing many to ration or skip doses.In response to a question from Sanders, the pharmaceutical executives all committed to keep their newest insulin available to patients at $35 a month or less.

130,1ac21bc2-4a15-422f-8967-6a3c260057f6,CI,2023-05-11,"Why indie pharmacies, with the help of the likes of Mark Cuban, are on the rise",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-indie-pharmacies-with-the-help-of-the-likes-of-mark-cuban-are-on-the-rise-193953230.html,1683747593,STORY,"['CI', 'WMT', 'GDRX', 'WBA', 'RAD', 'AMZN', 'CVS']","[Independent pharmacies have lost a lot of market share over time. But that trend has recently reversed slightly, making them attractive prospects for large pharmacy benefit managers like Cigna's (CI) Express Scripts, as well as startup discount platforms like Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs.The number of independents has gradually grown by 8% over the past 10 years, even though for decades they lost market share to big retail outfits. Between 2022 and 2023, so far, 99 new independent pharmacies have opened, which translates to 0.4% growth, according to the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association.That gradual change in landscape is attracting the attention of both Express Scripts and Cost Plus. In addition, indie pharmacies can help fill the coverage hole left by big retail chains.Cuban's Cost Plus, a discount platform that partners with PBMs, is capitalizing on growth in the niche market with new benefit cards that will be accepted by more than three dozen independent pharmacies in Indiana, Texas and New Jersey, with a growing list daily, it says.In a tweet announcing the move, Cuban said the new benefit card will not be available for big retail pharmacies because ""they don't like us. We will be working with indie pharmacies, groceries and others.""Unlike other discount cards, the benefit card is a membership tied to individual patients. And unlike discount cards, which charge pharmacies a fee for filling the prescription using their discount, Cost Plus will pay the pharmacies $8 — equivalent to the charge of labor of shipping if a patient orders from its website, according to the company.CEO Alex Oshmyansky said the goal is to cut out the middlemen and their fees by directly negotiating with manufacturers and passing on the savings. By doing so, ""We can decrease the cost to patients while making independent pharmacies....more sustainable as a business in the long term,"" he told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview.Story continues""It's always been in our plan to try and support the local pharmacists who are really in their community, who know their patients,"" Oshmyansky said. He added that big pharmacy managers, which set the drug prices, are often owned by the drug store chains like CVS. Thus, they have squeezed profits for independent pharmacies.""I think these entities are just addicted to these absurd profit margins, from these ultra-high-cost generic products, and are unwilling to bring them down,"" Oshmyansky said.Cost Plus is largely playing in the generics market, where other discounters like Walmart (WMT) and GoodRx (GDRX) have been for some time—and where there is significant competition for lower prices. Online pharmacies or mail-order platforms are also increasingly competitive for generics, including with Amazon (AMZN) now in the mix.All of this has added to the competition that independent pharmacies have faced in recent years.Meanwhile, Cigna's PBM, Express Scripts, announced a strategy that would increase reimbursements to independent pharmacies that fill prescriptions for its members, plus a longer-term strategy to increase the importance of these pharmacies in the communities they serve.Mark Cuban: Offering a lifeline to indie pharmacies? (Photo by Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports) (USA TODAY USPW / reuters)One for Express Scripts, according to president Adam Kautzner, is to ensure that underserved populations in both rural and urban areas finally get the attention they've been missing.Lack of access Underserved populations vary from rural areas to pockets that lack access in urban areas.The access gap has been amplified in recent years: Large retail chains like CVS, Walgreens (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) have announced that they have, or will be, closing locations. This year, CVS said it would shutter 900 outlets, but didn't specify where. (Rite Aid said it would open mini locations to serve rural areas.)A University of Southern California study shows that ""as of 2020, pharmacies in Black and Latino neighborhoods were more likely to close and less likely to offer immunizations, 24-hour, and drive-through services than pharmacies in other neighborhoods,"" according to the study's authors.The Cost Plus focus on these vulnerable populations can help independent pharmacies in these markets. The company recently announced a partnership with Zócalo Health, a telehealth platform that provides care for cash for underinsured and uninsured individuals in the LatinX market community, according to CEO Erik Cardenas. The National Hispanic Medical Association has told Congress that Latinos are more likely to be uninsured.It's why Zócalo teamed up with Cost Plus. The care providers at Zócalo can help ensure and track the fulfillment of prescription needs of patients, and answer questions about medications as needed.And the benefit goes both ways. The more independent pharmacies do business, the more drug manufacturers and insurers will too. Which is also why the additional screening and testing services, which could create more prescription volume, is part of the strategy.""By continuing to have accessibility to independent pharmacies, to keep them strong and to be able to continue to grow their own businesses, patients will be able to and get new prescriptions, refill their prescriptions, and stay adherent (to current prescriptions),"" Express Scripts' Kautzner said.More than drugs""I'm a pharmacist from rural America. So this area is also top of mind to me, of the role independent pharmacists play,"" Kautzner said.That's why he's spearheading the effort that will provide greater reimbursements for prescriptions for rural pharmacies that are within a 10-mile radius of an Express Scripts member.Express Scripts will also help boost the services such as common medical screenings and vaccinations.The company, meanwhile, is also convening a new advisory committee focused on independent pharmacies. That committee will also be instrumental in coordinating with state and federal government bodies to ensure these independent pharmacists are able to succeed. Kautzner said that in rural areas, which serve about 20% of the U.S. population, pharmacists sometimes are the only medical professional a person has access to as physicians are in short supply. ""So this is a way for them to expand the level of services that they can provide.""Kautzner said Express Scripts decided to launch the strategy after studying the independent pharmacy space last year and coming to the conclusion that there are more pharmacies opening up in some areas. He added: ""That's definitely encouraging, post-pandemic, that we are starting to see some of them continue to thrive and expand.""Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Its revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Trulicity, Taltz and others.Eli Lilly is regularly adding promising new pipeline assets through business development deals. Lilly expects to launch four new medicines by 2023 end with Mounjaro for type II diabetes and cancer drug Jaypirca already launched. Mounjaro sales are already benefiting from strong demand trends.However, the CRL for donanemab will probably delay the potential launch of the candidate. Generic competition for several drugs, rising pricing pressure in the United States and some international markets are some top-line headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Verizon Communications have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past six months (+1.4% vs. -4.1%). The company is witnessing significant 5G adoption and fixed wireless broadband momentum. It plans to accelerate the availability of the 5G Ultra Wideband network with C-Band deployment, focusing on 5G mobility, nationwide broadband and mobile edge compute.Customer-focused planning, disciplined engineering and continued network upgrades will likely augment its market position.

However, United Parcel Service now expects revenues in 2023 to be around $97 billion. The new forecast is at the low end of the previous outlook and much lower than 2022's actual figure. According to the Zacks analyst estimate, it is currently pegged at $96.98 billion.The gloomy forecast is mainly due to weak consumer sales. Notably, average daily volume declined 5.4% in first-quarter 2023 at the U.S. Domestic package segment.

Despite the double beat, PFE shares faced selling pressure post-earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, Pfizer shares aren’t expensive on a relative basis, with the current 11.5X forward earnings multiple sitting nicely beneath the 12.4X five-year median and highs of 13.5X just last year.The company sports a Style Score of “A” for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor those seeking an income stream, Pfizer has that covered; the company’s annual dividend presently yields a rock-solid 4.3%, with the payout growing 3.9% over the last five years.As shown below, the current yield is more than double the Zacks Medical sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlbemarleOn May 5th, CEO Kent Masters purchased roughly 5,400 Albemarle shares at a price tag of $181.64 per share, totaling nearly $1 million.Story continuesThe company has been a big beneficiary of elevated lithium prices, with earnings forecasted to climb 14% on 40% higher revenues in its current fiscal year. The growth tapers off in FY24, with earnings forecasted to pullback roughly 6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd similar to PFE, Albemarle shares provide a passive income stream, with the annual dividend currently yielding 0.8%. While the yield may be currently on the lower end, the company is committed to increasingly rewarding its shareholders, as shown in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEnphase EnergyMandy Yang, CFO, and VP, has purchased 3000 ENPH shares throughout May, with the transaction totaling roughly $550 thousand.

Welcome to the Royalty Pharma First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to George Grofik, SVP, Head of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead, sir.George Grofik: Good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Thank you for joining us to review Royalty Pharma’s first quarter 2023 results. You can find the press release with our earnings results and slides of this call on the Investors page of our website at royaltypharma.com. Moving to Slide 3. I would like to remind you that information presented in this call contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. I refer you to our 10-K on file with the SEC for a description of these risks. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Royalty Pharma, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand our financial performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release available on our website. And with that, please advance to Slide 4. Our speakers on the call today are Pablo Legorreta, Founder and Chief Executive Officer; Marshall Urist, EVP, Head of Research and Investments; and Terry Coyne, EVP, Chief Financial Officer. Pablo will discuss the key highlights Marsh will then provide a portfolio update, after which Terry will review the financials. Following concluding remarks from Pablo, we will hold a Q&amp;A session when we will be joined by Chris Hite, EVP, Vice Chairman. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Pablo.Pablo Legorreta: Thank you, George, and welcome to everyone on the call. I am delighted to report a strong start to 2023 as we deliver on our strategy as a leading funder of Innovation and Life Sciences. Slide 6 summarizes our financial and portfolio achievements in the first quarter, which again highlights our strong momentum and the power of our business model. First, we delivered strong performance. Adjusted cash receipts, our top-line grew by 11%. Adjusted EBITDA also by 11%, and adjusted cash flow grew by 49%. All the strong metrics were prior to the Biohaven related payments, which I will discuss on the next slide. Second, on capital allocation, we announced royalty position of up to $1.6 billion including $600 million in upfront payments and a multiyear share repurchase program of up to $1 billion.Story continuesI also personally intend to acquire up to an additional $50 million of Royalty Pharma stock given the compelling value, I believe the share represents. Third, we strengthened our royalty portfolio. We added three new therapies, including the SMA blockbusters Spinraza, and the exciting development stage therapies, pelacarsen and KarXT, both of which are potential future blockbusters on consensus estimates. Additionally, three medicines in our portfolio were approved by the FDA, and Xtandi had a positive Phase 3 readout for a potential label expansion with the EMBARK study. Fourth, we are reaffirming our increased full year guidance for adjusted cash receipts. Our guidance reflects expected underlying growth from our portfolio of between 4% and 9% prior to the Biohaven related payments.Consistent with our standard practice, our guidance is based on our current portfolio and does not include the benefit of any future acquisitions this year. On Slide 7, you can see our financials in more detail. We delivered 11% growth in our top-line prior to the Biohaven related payments and 87% growth if we increase includes the payments. As a reminder, the major nonrecurring items here are the $475 million milestone we received from Pfizer in March 2023, following the approval of Zavzpret for migraine, as well as the $13 million fixed Biohaven related payments were received in the same period a year ago. Foreign exchange continued to represent a headwind impacting our top-line by around minus 3% to minus 4% in the quarter. Consistent with our top-line, we grew our adjusted EBITDA by 11% in the quarter prior to the Biohaven related payments and 88%, including this payment.Adjusted EBITDA is an important non-GAAP measure for us, which is arrived at by divesting payments for operating and professional costs from our top-line. Lastly, our adjusted cash flow, our bottom line grew by 49% in the quarter prior to the Biohaven related payments and 165%, including this payment. The substantial increase in the quarter also reflected the $100 million upfront and milestone development stage payments to Cytokinetics in the prior year. Slide 8 shows our impressive track record of strong top-line growth since our IPO in June of 2020, including our double-digit growth in the first quarter. This reflects our ability to execute successfully and consistently against our strategy. Slide 9 provides a deeper dive into our top-line performance in the quarter to show the various moving parts.The strong performance of our base business and our acquisition of the Trelegy royalties allow us to deliver 11% top-line growth before taking into account the impact of the Biohaven related payments. Royalty expirations and tranching together represented a combined headwind to growth in the 7% to 8% range. The strong underlying dynamics in the quarter once again underscore the unique power of our business model to replenish our portfolio and to drive compounding growth. With that, I will hand it over to Marshall to update you on our portfolio.Marshall Urist: Thanks, Pablo. On the next few slides, I want to discuss our recent transactions in schizophrenia and also to provide a broader perspective on our approach to portfolio strategy. Last month, we were delighted to announce the acquisition of PureTech’s royalty on Karuna’s KarXT. This is a novel oral muscarinic agonist with two positive Phase 3 trials in schizophrenia. KarXT is also in development for the treatment of psychosis in Alzheimer’s disease. In return for an upfront payment of $100 million and $400 million in potential regulatory and sales milestones we will receive a 3% royalty on annual sales of KarXT up to $2 billion and approximately 1% above this threshold to provide some context for modeling the potential outflows for this transaction.The vast majority of the milestones require very strong commercial performance. Our excitement about this development stage medicine is driven by the results of the clinical program, including two Phase 3 studies, EMERGENT-2 and EMERGENT-3 and the significant need for new novel therapies in schizophrenia. Not only did the trials demonstrate early and sustained reductions in the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but importantly, – the tolerability profile was very encouraging, especially regarding some of those common adverse events typically associated with current medications, including weight gain, somnolence and extrapyramidal symptoms. Based on these strong results, Karuna plan to submit a new drug application to the FDA in the third quarter of this year.The street has certainly recognized the exciting profile of this compound with consensus sales projections rising to $5 billion by 2030. Slide 12 expands on the significant unmet need for new treatments in schizophrenia. On the left hand side, you can see that close to a third of patients do not respond to current therapy and only about half have a partial improvement or suffer unacceptable side effects. When taken together with the particular challenges of this disease, this results in approximately three quarters of patients discontinuing treatment within 18 months, which underscores the need for new treatment approaches. This is why we are so excited to have invested in two novel mechanisms of action through KarXT and MK-8189. Each potentially offers a differentiated clinical profile from current medications most notably on tolerability.KarXT, as I just highlighted, has already reported positive Phase 3 results and will be marketed by Karuna subject to FDA approval, and MK-8189 is a PDE10A inhibitor in Phase 2b where a potential royalty arises from a unique collaboration between Royalty Pharma and Merck. Taken together, this is another illustration of our unique ability to invest in multiple therapies in the same category where we see the potential for innovation to transform patient lives. Slide 13 returns to a concept that we showed at our Investor Day last year on selected investment themes of interest. Our investments in the schizophrenia category are consistent with two of these themes. The first is to explore the potential of under-innovated large markets where there is arguably been less industry-focused given the shift towards specialty markets with smaller patient populations and higher price points.Schizophrenia is a great example of a large under-innovated market, and we believe that KarXT and MK-8189 could bring important benefits to patients in this complex and difficult-to-treat population. In addition, we believe brain disease has tremendous scope for innovation with limited effective treatment options in many cases. Schizophrenia sits squarely in this heterogeneous category. Lastly, on Slide 14, I want to provide a long-term perspective on our balanced royalty acquisition strategy. This data shows how we have deployed our capital since 2012 between approved and development stage opportunities. On the left-hand side, you see that since we started investing in development stage therapies in 2012 of the approximately $21 billion in capital deployed, the majority of the investments have been in approved products.Pharmacy, Medicine, HealthPhoto by freestocks on UnsplashOn the right-hand side, you can see that the percentage deployed annually has exhibited significant variability on an annual basis, in part reflecting the opportunistic nature of our business, but in aggregate has also been skewed towards approved products on average at 59% of total capital. So while we do not have target levels of investment between approved and development stage, our therapeutic area agnostic approach to investing and position us the partner of choice in the royalty funding market – has allowed us to fund innovation in a balanced way while maintaining strong returns and long-term growth. With that, I’ll hand over to Terry.Terry Coyne: Thanks, Marshall. Let’s move to Slide 16. Total royalty receipts grew 72% in the first quarter versus the year ago period. Excluding the Biohaven related payments in each quarter, royalty receipts grew approximately 8%. The magnitude of growth reflects the $475 million Zavzpret milestone payment, together with strong contributions from the cystic fibrosis franchise, Tremfya and the Trelegy royalty, which we acquired last July. We also saw growing royalty contributions from Evrysdi and Cabometyx and from other medicines not shown on this slide, particularly Trodelvy and Orladeyo. Lastly, we received a $35 million payment related to AstraZeneca’s Airsupra. These positive factors were partially offset by the loss of the DPP-IV royalties by weakness in Imbruvica and to a lesser extent, Tysabri and by the adverse FX impact.Slide 17 shows how our efficient business model generates substantial cash flow to be redeployed. As you’re aware, adjusted cash receipts is a key non-GAAP metric for us, which we arrived at after deducting distributions to non-controlling interests. This amounted to $1.1 billion in the quarter or growth of 87% compared with last year’s first quarter. As Pablo noted earlier, prior to the impact of Biohaven related payments, growth would have been 11% in the quarter. As we move down the column, operating and professional costs were approximately 8% of adjusted cash receipts in the quarter. As a consequence, we reported 88% growth in adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, relatively consistent with our top-line growth. When we think of the cash generated by the business to be redeployed into new value-enhancing royalties, we look to adjusted EBITDA less net interest paid.Net interest paid in the quarter of $67 million reflected the semiannual timing of the payments on our $7.3 billion of unsecured notes, which occur in the first and third quarters. This figure included $16 million we received in interest given the strong cash position on our balance sheet, which benefited from higher interest rates. We did not have upfront and milestone payments for development stage funding in the quarter, whereas the prior year period included a $100 million payment related to Cytokinetics. As a consequence, adjusted cash flow, our bottom line grew significantly faster than adjusted cash receipts and adjusted EBITDA and amounted to $973 million or $1.60 per share for the quarter. This resulted in an adjusted cash flow margin of 86%, which once again highlights the efficiency of our business model.Let’s move now to Slide 18 and our financial position. We continue to maintain significant financial firepower for future royalty acquisitions. In the first quarter, we deployed a little over $600 million of capital on royalty acquisitions as well as around $120 million on dividends. This was more than offset by our strong cash flow generation over the quarter, so that our cash and marketable securities increased to $2 billion at the end of March. Our leverage at the end of the quarter stood at a comfortable 2.3 times total debt-to-EBITDA and 1.7 times net debt-to-EBITDA. As I have previously highlighted, the fixed rate average coupon on our debt is slightly above 2%, which compares to our target returns on royalty acquisitions in the high single-digit to teens percentage range.In addition, around 60% of our debt matures in 2030 or beyond. Taken together, we continue to believe that our cost of capital and debt maturity profile represent a durable competitive advantage for our business. Based on our financial strength and efficient business model, we remain confident in our ability to execute on our business plan and create value for shareholders. On Slide 19, I want to remind you of our capital allocation strategy and how we expect this to drive shareholder value creation. At our Investor Day last May, we outlined that over a five-year period through a combination of cash generation and our debt capacity we expect to have access to around $20 billion of capital. As you can see on this slide, the majority of our capital will be deployed on value-enhancing royalty acquisitions – with a target of $10 billion to $12 billion invested over the period.In fact, as many of you are aware, we are running a bit ahead of this schedule, having announced transactions of up to $5 billion in 2022. Furthermore, given the tailwinds in our industry and our powerful market positions, our transaction pipeline continues to remain robust and highly active. We aim to balance this primary focus on royalty acquisitions with returning to capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and when appropriate, share repurchases. Recently, the Board authorized a multiyear share buyback program of up to $1 billion, which is a reflection of the compelling value we see in our share price and our focus on efficient capital allocation to drive shareholder returns. By executing against this capital allocation strategy, we are confident we will continue to deliver on our mission of accelerating innovation in life sciences while generating strong returns and creating significant shareholder value.Slide 20 provides our full year 2023 financial guidance. We expect adjusted cash receipts to be in the range of $2.85 billion to $2.95 billion, consistent with the raised outlook we provided in March following receipt of the Zavzpret milestone payment. Importantly, and consistent with our standard practice, this guidance is based on our portfolio as of today and does not take into account the benefit of any future royalty acquisitions. Turning to our operating costs. We expect payments for operating and professional costs to be approximately 8% to 9% of adjusted cash receipts in 2023, in line with previous guidance. We continue to believe that the degree of margin protection provided by our unique business model is impressive in today’s inflationary environment.Similarly, interest paid for full year 2023 is still expected to be around $170 million and to follow the established quarterly pattern with de minimis amounts payable in Q2 and Q4. This does not take into account interest received on our cash balance, which was $16 million in the first quarter. You should also note that we expect to make a $50 million milestone payment to Cytokinetics in the second half of 2023 based on the company’s guidance of initiating their pivotal trial of Aficamten in non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This $50 million expense will be recorded as a development stage funding payment and thus reduce adjusted cash flow this year. Lastly, as many of you are aware, the royalties we receive lagged sales by one quarter, live product sales by one quarter.Additionally, several of our largest royalties are tiered, which typically reset at the beginning of the year and have the potential to increase throughout the year. Therefore, there is some seasonality to our business, and the second quarter tends to be lower than other quarters in the year, and the first quarter tends to be higher. Accordingly, we would expect adjusted cash receipts in the second quarter to be slightly higher compared with the same quarter in 2022. My final slide drills down further on our adjusted cash receipts guidance. The graphic is illustrative, but sets out the various pushes and pulls behind our outlook for 2023. Starting with the left hand side, we have faced a high base of comparison due to the $509 million of Biohaven related payment, which we received in 2022.Adjusting for these payments brings the underlying base for 2022 adjusted cash receipts to $2.28 billion. On the right side, if we start from the adjusted cash receipt base prior to Biohaven, we expect underlying growth of 4% to 9% this year, which we anticipate to be driven by the CF franchise, Tremfya and a full year of Trelegy royalties. Partially offset by the losses of exclusivity on the DPP-IV and Imbruvica weakness, which we believe we have conservatively reflected in our guidance. We also expect a modest contribution from three quarters of Spinraza royalties. As mentioned earlier, this growth does not include the benefit of any future acquisitions. Using today’s U.S. dollar exchange rates, FX is expected to represent a relatively modest headwind of minus 1% to minus 2%.Putting this all together, including the $475 million payment, milestone payment on Zavzpret, we are reaffirming our increased top-line guidance of $2.85 billion to $2.95 billion. With that, I would like to hand the call back to Pablo for his closing comments.Pablo Legorreta: Thanks, Terry. Let me close by saying how pleased I am with our excellent start to 2023. This sets us up well to deliver on our guidance for the full year and to continue to execute strongly against our strategy. To finish on Slide 23, I would like to highlight why Royalty Pharma’s business model offers a unique way to invest in biopharma. Starting with growth. As we announced at our Investor Day, we expect to deliver a top-line CAGR of more than 10% or more over this decade, which compares with consensus expectations of 4% for large biopharma. Despite being a relatively small company in terms of head count, we offer the benefits of scale with exposure to 15 blockbuster medicines as compared with an average of nine for the large biopharma companies.We have a similar low cost of capital for our development stage investments tend to be lower risk as we generally do not invest in therapies before clinical proof-of-concept, thereby avoiding the high failure rate of preclinical and early-stage clinical compounds. We have consistently delivered an attractive low double-digit rate of return on our investments and our – and while we are unable to provide a precise comparison with large biopharma, as you know, the R&amp;D productivity of the industry and returns on acquisitions are open for debate. We also offer a yield around 2%. And last but not least, our management team is fully aligned with shareholder interest with high ownership of the company, which is significantly higher than the management ownership in large biopharma.The ownership for named executive officers of Royalty Pharma is 16%, which compares to less than 1% for our large cap biopharma peers. However, when we consider all employees and the Board, ownership of areas department is even higher at around 32%. Taken together, I truly believe Royalty Pharma offers a unique, powerful business model with a very attractive growth and return profile when compared to the biopharma industry. With that, we would be happy to take your questions.George Grofik: We’ll now open up the call to your questions.

Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.Gabrielle Brown: Thank you, Kiley. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2023 third quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding FOX Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings.Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.Lachlan Murdoch: Thank you, Gabby, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. FOX's strong fiscal third quarter operating results once again demonstrate the power of our content and the brands it underpins and the repeated capability of our focused strategy to deliver solid financial results. In the quarter, we grew top line revenue by 18%, led by the remarkable 43% growth in advertising and a solid 3% growth in affiliate revenue. Underpinning this performance was a record Super Bowl LVII on the FOX Broadcast Network which generated approximately $650 million of gross advertising revenue across our businesses and was the key driver of our 61% advertising revenue growth at our Television segment. This year's Super Bowl matchup between Kansas City and Philadelphia delivered 115 million viewers across FOX platforms, making Super Bowl LVII the most watched program in U.S. television history and the pinnacle of an extraordinary year for FOX Sports.Story continuesThe strong lineup of programming and advertising demand for FOX Sports continues into our fourth quarter, which includes the return of NASCAR the second season of the USFL, the start of Major League Baseball's 2023 season, the finals of the UEFA Nations League and a first for FOX the Belmont Stakes. Leveraging the reach of a Super Bowl lead-in, we launched the second season of Next Level Chef, which promises to be the next big lifestyle franchise from our Studio Ramsay partnership. Our entertainment business also found success with the number one new series and new drama over the year in Accused and the number one new unscripted series in Special Forces: World's Toughest Test. FOX has now debuted the top new unscripted series for 5 consecutive seasons.In fact, the combined power of our sports and entertainment programming places FOX at number one amongst broadcast network season to date in the key 18 to 49 demo. Our strong sports calendar also had a halo effect at the FOX Television stations, which saw many local advertising verticals higher in the quarter. In what continues to be mixed local advertising market conditions, we are encouraged by growth in categories, including auto, restaurants and entertainment, but are watchful across other categories, including bedding, retail and telecom. Meanwhile, Tubi's performance in the third quarter was nothing short of stellar with revenue growth of 31% supported by sustained gains and engagement, where total view time increased 38% year-on-year.And while still early in the fourth quarter, the April results for Tubi show the momentum across the platform accelerating. Having recently marked the 3-year anniversary of our acquisition of Tubi, our progress over this longer-term time frame is just as impressive having grown quarterly TBT by over 200% and revenue by 400%. Just as importantly, the Tubi brand has asserted itself on the broader media landscape. Our viral Tubi spot in the Super Bowl, which received massive press coverage, had almost 7 billion impressions. And our strong growth and engagement has now led to Tubi's inclusion in Nielsen's The Gauge, marking the first time Tubi has reached 1% of total TV viewing minutes and making Tubi the most watched fast service in the United States.And just last month, we announced the formation of Tubi Media Group, under Paul Cheesbrough, which brings together our digital capabilities in a more formalized and coordinated way to help us better monetize our digital touch points across all our FOX properties. We thank Farhad for his entrepreneurial leadership at Tubi over the last 3 years and, of course, before he leaves the business in terrific shape with an outstanding team to drive continued strong growth. At FOX News Media, we retained our leadership position amongst our peers. The FOX News Channel ended the third quarter as the most watched cable network in total day and prime time while maintaining its lead as the most watched cable news network beating CNN and MSNBC combined. Also notably, the FOX Business Network ended the quarter as the most watched business cable network, leading CNBC in total viewers during the business day and market hours for the fourth consecutive quarter.streaming TV moviesPhoto by Ashley Byrd on UnsplashLet me briefly address the settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We made the business decision to resolve this dispute and avoid the acrimony of a divisive trial and a multiyear appeal process. Our decision clearly in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. The settlement in no way alters FOX's commitment to the highest journalistic standards across our company or our passion for unabashedly reporting the news of the day. We're proud of our FOX News team, the exceptional quality of their journalism and their stewardship of the FOX News brand. Whether it be our coverage of politics and elections, world events such as the war in Ukraine or domestic issues, such as the crisis at the border, our journalists bring compelling news home to our viewers every day.The standards behind this reporting are not only what makes us the number one cable news network by the number one network in all of cable. In fact, in a recent poll, 41% of respondents chose FOX News as their most trusted network news. So as we look ahead, we are confident in the strength of the FOX brands and the strength of our balance sheet. And while we are not completely immune to the headwinds facing the broader industry and the general economy, we are well positioned given our areas of differentiation. Nonetheless, you can expect us to be even more focused on our cost base as we look to reinforce our strategy for future growth. We remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value creation through the thoughtful management of our existing business, the pursuit of new and exciting adjacencies and returning capital to our shareholders.With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to take you through the details of the quarter.Steven Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. FOX again delivered strong underlying financials in our fiscal third quarter with 18% revenue growth and 3% EBITDA growth, bolstered by a record-breaking Super Bowl LVII. Our advertising revenues increased 43%, led by the Super Bowl, along with the higher volume of NFL playoff windows and accelerating growth at Tubi. Meanwhile, our affiliate revenues grew 3% on the back of pricing benefits from recent renewals partially offset by trailing 12-month subscriber losses continuing to run in the 7% range. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $833 million, up $22 million over the prior year quarter as these revenue increases were partially offset by higher expenses. This was primarily due to higher sports rights amortization and production costs associated with our NFL, Super Bowl and playoff schedule.The net loss attributable to stockholders was $54 million or negative $0.10 per share compared to net income of $283 million or $0.50 per share reported in the prior year period. The variance was primarily due to other net where we recognize charges associated with the FOX News Media litigation, partially offset by the gain associated with the change in fair value of the company's investments. Excluding these and other noncore items, earnings growth was strong with adjusted net income growing 8% to $494 million and adjusted EPS of $0.94 per share, up $0.13 against last year's $0.81 per share. Now turning to our segments, starting with Television, where revenue grew an impressive 36% in the quarter. Television advertising revenues led this growth with a 61% increase fueled by Super Bowl LVII, which, as Lachlan mentioned, generated over $650 million in gross revenue.We also benefited from 2 additional NFL playoff games, 1 divisional and 1 wildcard partially offset by the timing of 1 less regular season game. Momentum at Tubi remained strong with advertising revenues up 31% to $170 million on the back of increased engagement and stable pricing. These strong advertising tailwinds in the Television segment were partially offset by lower prime time ratings at the FOX Network and mixed base market conditions at our local stations when excluding the Super Bowl. Television affiliate fee revenues were up 9% and as healthy growth in pricing across FOX owned and operated and affiliated stations continued to outpace the impact from subscriber declines. Other revenues remained essentially unchanged from the prior year quarter.EBITDA at our Television segment was up $82 million to $117 million. Expenses increased in the quarter driven by higher costs related to the Super Bowl and a higher volume of NFL games. The increase in expenses was partially offset by lower costs at FOX Entertainment, including the absence of a write-down of certain scripted programming in the prior year quarter. Our net EBITDA investment in Tubi of approximately $60 million was broadly in line with the prior year quarter. At Cable, we saw revenues generally in line with the prior year. Cable advertising revenues were down 7% due to the impact of a softer direct response marketplace at FOX News Media, while being partially offset by the benefit of the World Baseball Classic on the national sports networks.Cable affiliate fee revenues were broadly flat, coming in at $1.1 billion with rate growth broadly offset by subscriber declines. Cable other revenues were up 10% in the quarter led by higher FOX Nation subscription revenues. EBITDA at our Cable segment was $792 million compared to the $864 million reported last year largely due to these revenue impacts along with elevated legal costs at FOX News Media and higher expenses associated with the second season of the USFL and the World Baseball Classic at FOX Sports. Now turning to cash flow where we generated strong free cash flow of $1.48 billion in the quarter, reflecting our normal seasonal cycle of collecting advertising revenues from our fall programming coupled with our major sports rights payments being concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year.From a share repurchase perspective, as we foreshowed on our last call, we continued with our normal cost buyback activity of $250 million in the quarter and deployed $1 billion of additional capital to an accelerated share repurchase transaction. We retired approximately 80% of the shares associated with the ASR in the March quarter and expect the remainder to settle in the coming months. We remain committed to fully utilizing our current $7 billion authorization, where we now cumulatively repurchased approximately $4.4 billion, representing 20% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. These meaningful capital return measures are enabled by the strength of our financial position, where we closed the quarter with $4.1 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt.While this reported cash balance does not include the impact of the Dominion settlement, we continue to maintain a very robust balance sheet that supports our ongoing commitment to capital returns as well as flexibility to pursue value-accretive investment. And with that, let me turn it back to Gabby to open Q&amp;A.Gabrielle Brown: Thank you, Steve. And now we would be happy to take questions from the investment community.See also 15 Best Interest Yielding Checking Accounts in the US and 13 Best Consulting Stocks to Buy Now.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

He may not like what you are going to tell him, but as long as you are not surprising him you will be OK,"" American Express Stephen Squeri told Yahoo! Finance.Execs at media giant Paramount — where Buffett is a 15.3% holder after building an initial stake in Nov. 2022 — must not have gotten that sage advice from the OG investor.And that calls into question what the Oracle will do next with his ownership stake.Last week, Paramount — which has made major progress on the streaming subscriber front with Paramount+ — surprised the heck out of investors like Buffett.Paramount posted a first quarter direct to consumer business loss of $511 million. A year ago, Paramount's direct to consumer business lost $456 million.That's a lot of losses for a business like Paramount+, which had 60 million subscribers exiting the first quarter. But it underscores how costly it is to produce content such as the hit Paramount show Yellowstone while also staying sharp on pricing to compete with fellow streamers Netflix, Disney, Amazon, etc.It's just a brutal business to be in.The fact ad revenue in Paramount's traditional TV business is under pressure in part to macroeconomic conditions only amplifies the losses at the streaming business.""Paramount is still moving through a difficult combination of heavy investments to try to offset structural decline in a weak cyclical top-line environment,"" said Macquarie Research analyst Tim Nollen in a client note.Nollen maintained an under-perform rating on Paramount's stock.Story continuesThe company then surprised investors again — such as Buffett — by slashing its quarterly dividend to $0.05 from $0.24.Buffett loves dividends.

149,a382db12-91b1-3df4-aa49-805abb1824d3,PYPL,2023-05-11,PayPal And Palantir Both Took The AI Plunge But Reactions Were Different,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-palantir-both-took-ai-182943258.html,1683743383,STORY,"['PYPL', 'PLTR']","[Two companies that were both partly founded by Peter Thiel reported their first quarter results, namely PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE: PLTR). Palantir shares catapulted on Tuesday after CEO outlined plans to capitalize AI boost, while PayPal increased its outlook for the year but its increased profitability was mostly the result of cost cutting, including staff cuts.PayPal’s Raised Profit Expectations Were Eclipsed By Adjusted Margin GuidanceWith its first quarter results, PayPal was able to beat estimates on both lines. The revenue beat was not very meaningful but the 9% YoY growth was pleasing as the posted revenue amounted to $7.04 billion. The earnings beat was sizeable as first quarter profit amounted to $795 million, a net income of 70 cents per share with adjusted earnings being $1.17 per share. Despite the fact PayPal’s trajectory weakened compared to the pandemic boom that fueled online transactions, PayPal still showed solid business growth despite the e-commerce spending slowdown, as well as intensified competition in the digital payments field.OutlookFortunately for PayPal, there seems to be plenty of room and potential in the digital payments space. Last year, online sales made only 15% of retail sales and that figure is expected to grow to 22% by 2025. PayPal raised its full year guidance despite the not so strong second quarter guidance. Yet, it did it by less than the market had anticipated, with a large part of the increased profitability coming from cutting staff and other costs. For the undergoing June quarter, PayPal expects EPS in the range between $1.15 to $1.17 while full-year earnings are guided at $4.95 per share.Full year adjusted operating margin is expected to expand 100 basis points, downsized after the prior forecast of 125-basis points growth.Palantir Reported Strong QuarterFor the period ended on March 31st, Palantir’s revenue expanded 18% to $525 million while adjusted earnings amounted to 5 cents. On Monday after market close, Palantir reported it earned a GAAP net income of $17 million on the back of government revenue rising 20% to $289 million, which was in line with estimates, and commercial revenue from the private sector, that makes up about 40% of its total revenue, and that rose 15% to $236 million,topping expectations of 217 million, according to Investor’s Business Daily.Story continuesOutlookThe maker of data analytics software gave a relentlessly bright outlook as it included AI power into its projections. For the undergoing June quarter, Palantir guided for revenue of $530 million, below estimates of $537 million.AI Demand Is Without PrecedentChief Executive Alex Karp believes the software maker is well-positioned to capitalize on AI developments, stating that the engagement and demand for the new AI Platform is without precedent, as the company works its way to convert this demand into an expanded reach.  First iteration will be available to selected customers as early as this month.Palantir’s Bright Outlook Possibly Dimmed By Its Dependence On Government WorkA cloud over Palantir that could dim Palantir’s bright AI-owed prospects is the fact that despite its conscious effort to diversify its business across health care, energy and manufacturing sectors, government agencies still account for almost 60% of its revenue. This is no longer a stable revenue stream as it used to be, considering Congress’ recent spending cuts initiatives.Different Stock ReactionsYear to date and heading into the latest reported, Palantir stock rose 15% in 2023. On the other hand, PayPal tumbled 12% upon the report on Tuesday despite solid results and most likely due to a cut outlook for the adjusted operating margin.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

PayPal stock slumped 5.4% after market on May 8, responding to earnings results. Shares slumped due to transaction margin pressures despite a spike in guidance.The payments giant cautioned that its adjusted operating margin won’t grow as quickly as the company previously anticipated, even after spending on its platforms surged more than expected in the first quarter, per Bloomberg.Deutsche Bank analysts said that transaction margins are presently under pressure and can improve year over year only on a rebound in branded volumes (as share loss concerns prevail). Hence, improved revenues are anticipated to be entirely offset by decreased transaction margins, per the analysts, as quoted on investing.com.Inside the ResultsThe company came up with quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 per share helped by cost cuts and growth in e-commerce. This compares to earnings of $0.88 per share a year ago. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Paypal, which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry, posted revenues of $7.04 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.69%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $6.48 billion.The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. Active accounts grew 1% for the quarter year over year, bringing total active accounts to 433 million. Total payment volume (TPV), a key measure of performance, rose 10%, to $354.5 billion.PayPal's Pandemic SuccessDuring the pandemic, PayPal amassed a lot of success as consumers shifted to online transactions, resulting in a surge in its revenues. PayPal revenues, for example, shot up from $17.8 billion in 2019 to more than $25 billion in 2021, per CNBC. Shares of the company also saw new heights during that period.Story continuesHowever, as pandemic restrictions began to ease, PayPal's stock growth slowed down, leading to a series of disappointing earnings reports. The company's latest earnings report raised concerns among investors, due to a weak guidance.Recent Slowdown in GrowthAt the height of the pandemic, e-commerce sales accounted for 16.4% of total retail sales in the United States. Since then, the growth has largely slowed down, remaining under 15% the past two years. As the lockdowns ended, people returned to in-person spending. Some even went back to cash transactions, per analysts. Rising competition in the digital-payment space is another key contributing factor to the pain in the stock.GuidanceFor Q2, adjusted EPS was expected to grow 24% to 26% to $1.15 to $1.17 on revenue growth in a range of 6.5% to 7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings growth was 26.88% and revenue growth was 6.37%.The company now expects adjusted EPS for the full year to grow by about 20% to $4.95, up  from the prior guidance of 18% growth to $4.87.

Todd Brooks, FalconStor's Chief Executive Officer; and Vincent Sita, Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the company's results and activities, and we'll then open the call to your questions. The company would like to advise all participants that today's discussion may contain what some consider forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in FalconStor's reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in the company's press release issued today. During today's call, there will be discussions that include non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP results to GAAP has been posted on FalconStor's website at www.falconstor.com under Investor Relations. After the close of business today, FalconStor released its Q1 2023 earnings. Copies of the earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on FalconStor website at www.falconstor.com. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Todd Brooks. Todd, I believe you're on mute.Robert Todd BrooksThank you, Clark. I appreciate that. And thanks for everybody for joining our call today. I appreciate you taking your time. Q1 was obviously a very important quarter for us as we increased our annual recurring revenue, we added new hybrid cloud customers through our partnership with IBM. We expanded our MSP business, and we improved legacy customer retention. We are a trusted data protection innovator, and we enable the world's most demanding managed service providers and enterprises to modernize their disaster recovery and data backup operations for the hybrid cloud world, protecting data across on-premises data centers, public cloud and private cloud environments. Migration to the cloud data, center rationalization and increased leverage of outsourced managed services are top priorities for enterprise CIOs and are fundamental macro shifts to which FalconStor technology in our 20-plus years of market experience are well aligned. Our solutions deliver increased data security and provide for quick data recovery, including recovery from ransomware attacks. And our solutions accomplished these while driving down long-term data storage footprints by up to 95%. Our hybrid cloud data protection solutions excel in 4 key areas: first, is scalability as our solutions enable customers to protect their mission-critical enterprise workloads; second, in offsite protection as our customers have flexibility to leverage any storage medium from legacy tape to modern cloud-based object storage; third, in cost savings as our industry-leading patented data deduplication technology empowers our customers to decrease their backup data storage by up to 95%; and then fourth, in hardware vendor flexibility as our solutions integrate with IBM's Power System hardware or commodity Intel-based hardware. Packaged together, these advantages give our solutions competitive differentiation, especially within IBM-centric enterprise IT environments and managed service provider IT environments. We are -- we talk about this almost every earnings call, but we are really excited by the growth markets in which we operate and our -- and those markets' ability to drive significant recurring revenue growth for FalconStor. Data protection as a service, hybrid cloud and managed IT services are growing quickly and are clear reflection of macro shifts in our industry, to which FalconStor technology and experience are well aligned. In fact, the data protection as a service market is predicted to grow by 31% annually to $104 billion in 2027, the worldwide hybrid cloud market is predicted to grow by 20% annually to $204 billion in 2027, and the managed IT services market is predicted to grow by 8% annually to $355 billion in 2026. Our go-to-market focus on hybrid cloud partners, like IBM, and managed service providers will be key drivers for FalconStor to generate consistent and meaningful recurring revenue growth over the next several years. As mentioned during our last earnings call, for fiscal year 2023, we have implemented 3 key strategic initiatives, and we'll go through these each time during our earnings calls in 2023. First, the initiative is generating consistent recurring revenue growth by expanding our differentiated hybrid cloud data protection leadership position for the tens of thousands of companies that operate IBM Power System environments. Second, on accelerating our recurring revenue growth by extending our IBM-centric hybrid cloud data protection position into Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and AWS public cloud environments. And then finally, by continuing to aggressively control our operating expenses, deliver consistent profitability, limit our risk while we accelerate our hybrid cloud-focused recurring revenue base. To this point, we are excited by the hybrid cloud resell relationship we launched in late Q2 of last year with IBM to provide several new joint solutions, which combine FalconStor StorSafe VTL software with IBM Cloud Object Storage, IBM Power hardware and IBM Power Virtual Server cloud environments. And we're very happy to report that our sales continue to increase through this relationship with IBM Q1. And our customer satisfaction has remained very high with IBM customers using these solutions. And these joint solutions really fall into 3 categories to migrate and optimize data protection for IBM customers. And these include the following 3 solutions: first, an optimized backup and restore solution, where enterprise running their IBM applications on premises or in the IBM Power Virtual Server cloud can utilize our joint solution to securely and effectively back up or efficiently back up to IBM Cloud Object Storage. Second, within cloud migration solutions, for enterprises needing to migrate their existing on-premise applications to the IBM Power Virtual Server cloud, our StorSafe software takes a secure snapshot and restores it to the cloud, maximizing application availability and security. And then finally, an advanced hybrid cloud backup solution for MSPs looking to use the cloud for a secure air-gapped offsite location. FalconStor and IBM deliver an on-premises solution with a cloud instance for secure and encrypted off-site backups. This partnership with IBM is obviously a material step forward for FalconStor and should be a significant contributor to our long-term strategic goal to significantly increase hybrid cloud recurring revenue. Right. Let's move on now to our Q1 results. We have seen material recurring revenue growth since launching sales of IBM and IBM partners in the second half of last year. And that growth continued, as I mentioned, in Q1 as the ARR run rate of our hybrid cloud business increased 81% compared to the previous quarter. Within that hybrid cloud total revenue, our MSP ARR run rate increased by 23%. And clearly, we're very pleased with this continued validation, this early validation of our hybrid cloud focus with IBM. But we believe that we can increase these growth rates even further in coming quarters. As aid to this hybrid cloud growth and MSP ARR run rate growth, we retained 100% of our hybrid cloud customers in the second -- in Q1 and had storage capacity used by our installed base customers increase by 0.3% on average each month. In addition to that -- to strong customer retention and installed base capacity growth, we also saw wins again across all 3 of our major regions, the Americas, Asia Pacific and EMEA. We won 14 new hybrid cloud customers during the quarter, and we have received industry recognition from IT Jungle on -- which is an IBM-centric online publication, which I've actually shown a screenshot here. Clearly, I'm not going to read this, but this article and several customer references that we've received over the last couple of quarters are available on falconstor.com and we leverage these consistently within IBM in FalconStor-related marketing material. So with that, I'm going to, at this point, turn it over to Vince, who will provide a more detailed overview of our Q1 2023 financial results. Vince?Story continuesVincent SitaThanks, Mark. So if we look at the income statement, we closed Q1 of this year with $2.3 million in revenues, operating expenses of $2.3 million, net operating loss of $421,000 and a net loss of $448,000. So how did this compare to prior year, Q1 of 2022? So revenues represent an increase of 11%. Operating expenses were 16% lower or $400,000 lower than the previous year, Q1 2022. So as a result, net operating income was $0.7 million higher in 2023 versus 2022. Net income in Q1 2023 was a net loss of $448,000 versus a net loss of $1.1 million last year, Q1 2022. If we look at our -- the balance sheet on the next page, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 million compared to $2 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $3.4 million as at March 31, 2022 so, therefore, a decrease of $0.2 million from Q4 of 2022 and a decrease over Q1 2022 of $1.6 million. Looking at net working capital. So net working capital cash, which we exclude contract assets and deferred revenues, but include the redemption value of our term notes, ended at $872,000, a decrease of $0.3 million from Q4 2022 and a decline of $0.9 million from Q1 2022. We closed the quarter with $1.8 million in accounts receivable -- accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.7 million and deferred revenues of $5 million. So Todd, I'll turn it back to you if you have any other final comments.Robert Todd BrooksWell, thanks, Vince. I appreciate that. And clearly, we're encouraged by the progress that we're making with IBM and our every cloud focus. We've got a lot of work to do. We're going to clearly continue to work hard to manage our expenses, make sure that we are profitable or very close to profitability every quarter. Clearly, we fell short of that a little bit in Q1. Although we did dramatically improve, our net income still was a loss for the quarter, so we've got a little bit of work to do there. But nonetheless, we're excited by the increase in hybrid cloud sales and just engagement in general with IBM and that partnership and the IBM partners. So with that, let me pause and, Clark, you can open up the floor for questions.Clark LiddellAbsolutely. Thanks, Todd. (Operator Instructions) And if you want to type a question in that box, then I will read it to Todd and/or Vince, and they'll be glad to answer it for you. So we'll just give you a few seconds here to type a couple a question or 2 in. Okay. Todd, I'm not seeing any questions as of this time. So I'll turn it back to you.Robert Todd BrooksAll right. Thanks, Clark. Once again, thanks, everybody, for your time. I look forward to connecting again in the quarter and look forward to continue to work hard to grow this business with IBM and business in general with FalconStor. So thanks again for taking your time, and we'll talk next time.]"

This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home In a Q&amp;A with reporters on Monday, IBM chief Arvind Krishna said a redux of the tech the company created years earlier, dubbed “watsonx,” would help companies build models according to their needs, and predicted that A.I. will take over “repetitive back-office processes” from human workers.“We see this easily taking anywhere from 30 to 50% of that volume of tasks and being able to do them with really as much or better proficiency than even people can do,” Krishna said, according to CNBC.“That lot, we see getting embraced right away starting this year, and getting to full fruition over the next three to five years.”IBM did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.On Tuesday, IBM announced a host of other new A.I. initiatives, including a tool that can calculate carbon emissions and a new infrastructure on IBM Cloud that is tailored for A.I.-related uses. Krishna said that those A.I. tools would be seamlessly integrated in different roles such as customer care, IT operations and cybersecurity at the company.Krishna has previously said that IBM itself anticipates it will pause hiring for roles that A.I. could do, such as non-customer-facing roles like human resources. That would impact about 7,800 jobs, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. In a statement to Fortune last week, the company clarified that there’s no blanket hiring pause at the company, and that it’s instead “being deliberate and thoughtful in our hiring with a focus on revenue-generating roles,” and being “very selective” about hiring for jobs that aren’t client- or technology-focused. When asked for comment again, the company pointed to their previous statement.Story continuesIBM’s new A.I. products are in direct response to others like OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT, which took the world by surprise late last year. Google is also racing to catch up in the A.I. race. When IBM introduced the first Watson, it was costly for companies to adopt, according to Reuters. The company is now marketing the business-focused watsonx as an A.I. development platform that businesses could use to build their own models for a number of things, from customer care or writing code.“With IBM watsonx, clients can quickly train and deploy custom A.I. capabilities across their entire business, all while retaining full control of their data,” Krishna told Fortune this week. IBM is partnering with HuggingFace, an A.I. startup, by working with its open-source libraries, and the company already locked down NASA, Meta and Wix as clients. The new watsonx will be available in July 2023.A.I. and the Future of WorkThe future of work could be shaped by A.I. in more ways than we can imagine, and Krishna has been predicting for months that it will affect office workers in particular.“I do think clerical white-collar work is going to be able to be replaced by this,” Krishna told the Financial Times in February. He added that aggregating information before making decisions can be time-consuming, and A.I. can help speed up that process so things can move more quickly. He has also previously framed it as a solution to population trends.“We do have a shortage of labor in the real world, and that’s because of a demographic issue that the world is facing. So we have to have technologies that help,” he said in the FT interview.While people continue to weigh the impact of A.I. on jobs, experts are split on whether the shift will be positive or negative.“I think there’s a risk that ChatGPT makes us a lot more productive in easy-to-do stuff, but the hard part to figure out is how we can use A.I. to create innovation that then creates new occupations and new industries,” Carl Benedikt Frey, an Oxford economist who predicted automation would wipe out 47% of U.S. jobs 10 years ago, told Fortune in February.For their part, workers have started to get anxious about the relevance of their jobs in the face of powerful A.I. tools akin to ChatGPT. Data shows that 74% of employed Americans are already familiar with ChatGPT for work tasks, 40% of whom are concerned about their roles being replaced by A.I.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

""It really does change how people work.""Thomas’ advice for managers to start using A.I. if they want to future-proof their roles, rings similar to Yishan Wong’s advice to workers concerned about being replaced by A.I.Instead of wasting time worrying, Wong told Fortune that workers should look into how to side-step their careers into A.I. because it doesn’t require “an enormous amount of technical skill"".Story continues""Nontechnical people can build pretty valuable and novel applications on AI. There's this enormous amount of leverage that an individual can have,"" he added.Likewise, the economist Richard Baldwin echoed ""A.I. won't take your job"" during a panel at the 2023 World Economic Forum's Growth Summit. ""It's somebody using A.I. that will take your job.""Regardless of the job function, he thinks that automation and A.I. will disrupt every single role, and as such, “everyone will need to learn how to deal with it”.Managers would do well to listen: If they're worried about the longevity of their role, it may be wise to take up the experts’ advice and start learning how to use A.I. pronto.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Marathon Petroleum's shares before the 16th of May to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of June.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.75 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.00 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Marathon Petroleum has a trailing yield of 2.7% on the current stock price of $111.72. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Marathon Petroleum's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Marathon Petroleum has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 8.4% of its income after tax. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Luckily it paid out just 8.3% of its free cash flow last year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see Marathon Petroleum's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 42% per annum for the past five years. Marathon Petroleum earnings per share have been sprinting ahead like the Road Runner at a track and field day; scarcely stopping even for a cheeky ""beep-beep"". We also like that it is reinvesting most of its profits in its business.'Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Marathon Petroleum has lifted its dividend by approximately 16% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.Final TakeawayIs Marathon Petroleum an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We love that Marathon Petroleum is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.So while Marathon Petroleum looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. We've identified 2 warning signs with Marathon Petroleum (at least 1 which can't be ignored), and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

That is the point after all in getting a well-known figure for some promotional activities.But what happens when the chosen celebrity happens to be the wrong fit? Well, Anheuser-Busch can tell you all about that. The Bud Light-owner decided to run a promotional push for the beer by bringing on board transgender ‘influencer’ Dylan Mulvaney, who counts over 10 million followers on TikTok. Mulvaney advertised Bud Light on her feed – and a backlash duly ensued.Turns out the conservative crowd were unhappy with that choice and evidently there are a lot of conservative Bud Light fans. Calls for a campaign to boycott the drink/company did the job, and in April, Anheuser-Busch volumes fell by over 12% with Bud Light posting what Beer Business Daily has described as a ‘shocking deterioration’ of 21.4%.Meanwhile, competitors have been reaping the rewards of the conservative ire. Rivals Molson Coors and Constellation notched respective growth of 7.6% and 3.8% during the same period.So, until this controversy dies down and the next outrage kicks off, it might be worth leaning into the stocks that are already benefiting from the situation. We’ve turned to TipRanks, the world’s most comprehensive database of analysts and research, to get insights from Wall Street experts. Let’s take a closer look.Constellation Brands (STZ)In the wake of the Mulvaney fallout, Constellation Brands’ top brass must be rubbing their hands with glee. As the importer of the best-selling imported brands in the US – Modelo and Corona – the company is already reaping the rewards. Those brands aside, Constellation owns a diverse portfolio of well-known names, including Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford, Casa Noble Tequila, Svedka Vodka and High West Whiskey, amongst plenty of others.In recent years, the firm has focused on expanding its presence in the high-end beer market, particularly with the growth of the craft beer industry. Furthermore, in addition to its alcohol activities, the company has investments in cannabis and healthcare.Story continuesInvestors did not seem too flustered by the company not being on point with all metrics in the most recent financial report – for fiscal 4Q23. Revenue fell by 4.8% year-over-year to $2 billion, while also falling $20 million short of the forecast. On the bottom-line, however, EPS of $1.98 trumped the $1.84 anticipated by the Street. For the coming year, Constellation expects EPS to come in the range between $11.70-$12.00, slightly higher than the consensus midpoint of $11.80. The company also said it would bump the quarterly dividend up by 11.3% to $0.89 from $0.80 per share. That currently generates a yield of 1.43%.While Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian concedes the latest financial statement had “puts and takes,” there are enough positive developments to fuel the bull-case.“Taking a step back, there has been a lot of beer depletion volatility the last few quarters, but with solid trends ex California and assumed California weather normalization going forward, STZ’s positive topline tone and clarity now on margins, we see STZ’s 17.1 times CY24e P/E as way too low vs 7% corporate topline growth, and like the stock here,” Mohsenian explained. “Margins have been a big focus in recent quarters, but with greater clarity on FY24 and potential outsized FY25 expansion as lower spot costs flow through, we expect this debate to now recede.”Putting these thoughts into ratings and numbers, Mohsenian considers STZ as Overweight (i.e., Buy), while his $277 price target makes room for 12-month returns of 23%. (To watch Mohsenian’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on the Street, STZ receives an additional 11 Buys and 3 Holds, all coalescing to a Strong Buy consensus rating. (See STZ stock forecast)Molson Coors (TAP)The next “Mulvaney Gate” name we’ll look at has also seen its sales get a recent strong boost from the Bud Light palaver. Molson Coors is the maker of Coors Light (up 17.3% in April) and Miller Lite (up 19.1%). Those are just some of the well-known brands in the multinational brewing company’s portfolio – Carling, Molson Canadian, Blue Moon, Peroni Nastro Azzurro and Cobra are some of the others.In addition to beer brands, Molson Coors also owns and markets a range of hard seltzers, such as Vizzy, Coors Seltzer, and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, as well as ready-to-drink cocktails. The company also produces and markets a range of non-alcoholic beverages and a variety of craft beers through its Tenth and Blake division.It’s a value proposition that served the company well in the recently reported Q1 earnings. Revenue increased by 6.3% year-over-year to $2.35 billion, coming in $120 million above the forecast. Adj. EPS of $0.54 beat the $0.26 expected by the analysts. For the 2023 outlook, the company reiterated its previous targets, including expectation of a low single-digit increase for net sales compared to 2022 (on a constant currency basis).Roth MKM analyst William Kirk notes the guide might disappoint some investors, but he remains unperturbed.“While some may consider an unchanged guidance worrisome, we believe the potential variance to the guide sits squarely on the positive side: U.S. April volumes are running +HSD, and with y/y cuts to marketing spend, the P&amp;L leverage is likely to be outstanding,” Kirk explained. “Volume performance, even adjusted for an extra selling day, was much better than prior quarters. Importantly, this 1Q beat comes before U.S. demand shifted away from Bud Light and toward Miller Lite and Coors Light.”So, what does this all mean for investors? Kirk maintained a Buy rating on Molson shares to go alongside a $75 price target. Should the figure be met, investors stand to pocket gains of 16% over the next year. (To watch Kirk’s track record, click here)Not all on the Street, however, are quite as confident. The stock garners a Hold consensus rating based on 8 Holds and 4 Buys and Sells, each.

Originally brewed for Colorado gold and silver miners to enjoy after a hard day's work, Coors Banquet has been a part of history and pop culture for a century and a half. The iconic stubby bottle was even smuggled across the country before it became available east of the Mississippi in 1981.

""The Coors Banquet Legacy Fund will help entrepreneurs of the next generation get one step closer toward their goals by providing funds to help make their business dreams a reality.""Coors Banquet will accept U.S.-based submissions that meet the criteria and uphold the brand's values, like the willingness to persevere through hardships and a commitment to making a positive impact in the community.

GM, Park Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. PK and PVH Corp. PVH.These 4 Low Price-to-Cash-Flow Stocks Have Winning PotentialValue style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock's inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company's financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Unum Group, General Motors Co., Park Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. and PVH Corp. boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company's earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company's liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company's liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesHowever, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are four of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Unum Group, which provides financial protection benefit solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 9.1% for three-five years.

165,a4c0b368-4328-4af8-899a-968cbbbbcb3f,TGT,2023-05-11,Wealthy Americans are getting hit hardest by the economy slowing down,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wealthy-americans-are-getting-hit-hardest-by-the-economy-slowing-down-160522161.html,1683734722,STORY,"['BAC', 'LOW', 'TGT', 'HD', 'AMZN', 'MMM', 'PG']","[Wealthier Americans aren't spending — or earning—like they used to.Data from Bank of America Institute out Wednesday reveals households making more than $125,000 have seen wage growth slow down faster than lower-income households while spending trends have followed a similar pattern. Higher-income households' discretionary spending on Bank of America credit and debit cards has slipped below lower- and middle-income groups since the start of this year.The data is notable, Bank of America argues, because the highest-earning 40% of households by income accounts for more than 60% of overall consumer spending. Its calculation of wages includes bonuses, which tend to fluctuate more than base pay.“A labor market slowdown driven by the higher end of the income scale could have an outsized impact on the overall economy,” BofA wrote in a note to clients. “As of now, the labor market is beginning to soften from a very buoyant initial position, so it will likely take quite some time before the full impact on consumer spending comes through.”While unemployment remains at historically low levels, Bank of America says unemployment benefit claims are rising the fastest in the highest income group. Higher income houses filing for unemployment benefits rose 40% in April from the same month a year prior — more than five times the rate of the lower income bracket, according to BofA internal data on direct deposits into customer accounts in 30 states.So while the April jobs report showed an overall resilient labor market coming in hotter-than-expected for the 13th straight month, BofA’s data shows the cracks are occurring in the highest income bracket, where headlines of layoffs have littered the tech industry for months.Bank of America Institute data shows households making more than $125,000 are seeing wage growth decline faster than any other income cohort.Overall, total card spend declined on a yearly basis in April for the first time since February 2021, per Bank of America data. Within retail, luxury fashion is one the biggest laggards, falling 15% compared to 2022. In services, lodging fell more than 3% compared to last year while spending at airlines dropped 4.5% compared to the month prior.Story continuesWhile savings and checking balances at Bank of America still remain over 40% higher than pre-pandemic levels, the slowing trends in spending fit in line with other economic data from pervious months and commentary from quarterly earnings calls.Retail sales fell double what analysts had predicted in March, as some economists pointed out the picture was only growing worse.“Monthly data suggest that consumer spending has lost momentum over the past few months,” Jay Bryson Wells Fargo Chief Economist said in a note on April 27. “Moreover, consumers are relying increasingly on credit and stockpiled cash to finance their purchases. These factors are not sustainable, in our view.”“We continue to forecast that the U.S. economy slip into recession, which we expect will be of moderate severity, in the second half of the year.”Procter &amp; Gamble's Dawn and Bounty are seen in a store in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly (Andrew Kelly / reuters)'A cautious consumer' Some of America’s largest consumer brands flashed similar warning signals during their earnings calls. Amazon (AMZN) warned of “cautious spending.” 3M Company (MMM) sees weakness in ""consumer-facing markets."" And Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) said its “more careful” consumers are conserving sheets of paper towels.The gloomy outlooks come as several big box retailers still haven’t reported earnings. Home Depot (HD), Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are all expected to report first-quarter earnings next week.And while earnings have widely beat the Street’s muted first quarter expectations, investors will closely watch what each company says about the remaining nine months of 2023.“The earnings season in retailers is going to provide the most opportunity, in my opinion, for the individual investor in terms of where to see what comes next, and the most important part are going to be those CEO comments.,” JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America, told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday.Josh is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Increasingly, robots are being used to help with everything from cleaning our floors to performing medical procedures. It appears as if the futuristic growth potential of robotics has no end in sight.Robots have become so pervasive that many of us today are unaware of how they’ve infiltrated our daily lives, helping to park our cars and adjust the temperature in our homes. Today, the robotics industry is worth $35 billion and growing, according to market research firm Statista. Service robots that aid consumers and homeowners are the biggest segment of the robotics market, generating $26 billion in annual revenue.Going forward, robots are expected to become even more prevalent in our daily lives, especially as artificial intelligence (AI) explodes. Here are the top three robotics companies to invest in.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comDigital personal assistants, delivery drones and iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) are a few of the reasons why investors should view e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a robotics company. Increasingly, Amazon is turning to robots, whether to locate and pack items at its fulfillment centers or to sell to consumers for use in their homes. Amazon has bid $1.7 billion to acquire iRobot, the company behind the popular robotic vacuum cleaner called Roomba. That deal is currently awaiting regulatory approval.Clearly, Amazon sees robots as a big part of its future, both to drive productivity and sales. The adoption of robots could increase as AI is integrated into more machines, making them even more capable and productive. For investors, the push into robotics is yet another reason to take a position in a leading tech company whose stock is available at bargain basement prices right now. AMZN stock is down 18% over the last 12 months and nearly 30% below its 52-week high of $146.57. Buy the dip.Story continuesiRobot (IRBT)An iRobot (IRBT) Roomba inside Saturn electronic storeSource: Grzegorz Czapski / Shutterstock.comSpeaking of iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT), investors looking for big gains in robotics stocks might want to take a position in the core robotics company’s stock before the Amazon purchase is completed. Currently, IRBT stock is trading 65% below the $61 per share price that Amazon has agreed to pay shareholders for the company. That means an investment made in iRobot today would result in a 65% profit for investors once the deal closes. How likely is it that the deal will be approved by regulators? While not a slam dunk, it does have a reasonable chance of getting the green-light.The $1.7 billion price tag on the iRobot acquisition is negligible to Amazon. Plus, acquiring IRBT will not give the e-commerce company an excessively large share of the robotics market. The main issue is that the Roomba vacuum cleaners could give Amazon data on consumers’ homes, their interiors, and their lifestyles. While those concerns might be overblown given the focus of the Roomba on cleaning floors, the worries have nevertheless pushed IRBT stock down 34% in the last 12 months, setting up what could be a nice merger arbitrage.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comMedical device company Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) has been on a tear lately. In the past six months, ISRG stock has rallied 26% and is now trading near its 52-week high. The company is surfing a wave of strong earnings and robust sales of its da Vinci surgical system. The Covid-19 pandemic created a surgical backlog that is now unwinding big time, driving sales for the company upwards. Over the past five years, ISRG stock has nearly doubled.Sales are particularly strong for the surgical instruments and accessories that are used with the da Vinci system. Da Vinci uses robotics to carry out minimally invasive surgical procedures on the heart, and to remove all or part of the prostate gland. ISRG stock recently jumped 10% after the company’s first-quarter earnings beat analysts’ consensus forecasts. EPS increased 8.8% from a year earlier and sales of the da Vinci surgical system rose 12%.

172,f07f0bbd-ac7f-3a01-ad53-b86f4d99ae8e,MAR,2023-05-11,Do Marriott International's (NASDAQ:MAR) Earnings Warrant Your Attention?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marriott-internationals-nasdaq-mar-earnings-122111147.html,1683721271,STORY,['MAR'],"[The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Marriott International with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Marriott International How Fast Is Marriott International Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Recognition must be given to the that Marriott International has grown EPS by 47% per year, over the last three years. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Not all of Marriott International's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. Unfortunately, Marriott International's revenue dropped 4.3% last year, but the silver lining is that EBIT margins improved from 31% to 57%. That's not a good look.Story continuesThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Marriott International?Are Marriott International Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Marriott International has a market capitalisation of US$54b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$8.7b. This totals to 16% of shares in the company. Enough to lead management's decision making process down a path that brings the most benefit to shareholders. So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.Should You Add Marriott International To Your Watchlist?Marriott International's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest.

(Operator Instructions) A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Dennis Daly, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Dennis DalyThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Casa Systems released results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 ended March 31, 2023 this afternoon after the market closed. If you did not receive a copy of our earnings press release, you may obtain it from the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.casa-systems.com. With me on today's call is Ed Durkin, our Chief Financial Officer and Interim CEO. This call is being webcast and will be archived on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before I turn the call over to Ed, I'd like to note that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements based on the business environment as we currently see it, and as such, it does include certain risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release and our SEC filings for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the projections described in today's discussion. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call or in the earnings release are based upon information we believe as of today and undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, we report certain financial measures that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles. During the call, we may use non-GAAP measures if we believe it is useful to investors or believe it will be helpful to investors to better understand our performance or business trends. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed. Ed?Story continuesEdward M. DurkinThank you, Dennis, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call today. We issued 3 press releases and filed an 8-K this afternoon, including our first quarter 2023 financial results, which I'll cover in more detail momentarily. Since reporting on our fourth quarter results in mid-March, the entire team at Casa Systems has made great progress in streamlining our organization, executing on our 2023 business plan by delivering market-leading solutions to market, closing new sales deals and positioning ourselves to improve future profitability, and I'm pleased with the considerable changes we have made. But before I speak to our financial performance in the quarter, I'm also very pleased to say that in one of our other press releases today, we announced the execution of our strategic term loan B transaction support agreement, TSA, with the majority of our lender group, which when formally completed, will extend our debt maturity to December 2027, all as detailed in the 8-K we filed on this TSA matter today as well. When the financing completed by that TSA is finalized, we'll have a significantly extended maturity date of this facility from December 2023 to December 2027, which gives us the time and flexibility to continue with our efforts to significantly enhance shareholder value by executing on our previously announced cash and capital efficient growth plan and our plan to further aggressively delever. This is a significant milestone for Casa, and we believe the support of the large majority of the lenders for the TSA demonstrates their confidence in our operating plan and the resiliency of our business. As you can imagine, in a comprehensive process like the one we just went through, there are third parties involved looking at all aspects of our business. I'm very pleased with the feedback, particularly on the competitive differentiation of our cloud and cable product offerings and our ability to capitalize on the core market segments we are focused on. Our market-leading product portfolios for cable access and cloud are complete, with no major product portfolio gaps and with strong customer demand across all market segments. I would finally like to thank the whole Casa team and the talented teams at JPMorgan and Sidley Austin for all their hard work to allow us to announce this important TSA today. And I would finally like to thank our term loan B debt holders for their steadfast support and considerable efforts in getting this TSA agreement done. The other press release we issued this afternoon was a new virtual CCAP and RPD node customer win with Claro Colombia. This deal, which we originally thought would close in Q1 2023, but then was delayed for a few weeks as we dealt with some untruths being circulated by some of our fact-challenged competitors, was great validation of the capabilities of our virtual CCAP core and RPD node offerings, which we've invested heavily and over the past few years. And we hope to announce other like virtual CCAP core and RPD node customer wins in the very near future. This string of good news builds up the great momentum we had last month when we announced that our innovative DA 2200 Distributed Access node, the only FPGA-based DOCSIS 4.0 already Remote PHY node in the industry, was successfully deployed with Tier 1 cable MSOs in North and South America. This solution has set industry benchmarks for performance and flexibility as our DA 2200 Distributed Access nodes provides cable operators with a flexible foundation that enables a smooth, cost-effective future transition to distributed cloud native environments. Switching gears, in mid-April, we also announced that LG U+, a leading South Korean mobile network operator, is working with Casa and our partner, E-Tech System, to deploy our eNode B Gateway and Security Gateway solutions, which will enable LG U to simplify its network, improve, therefore, G service coverage and service quality and more easily capitalize on their growing market opportunity. We're continuing to work with multiple operators like LG U+ in the region, and we expect this deployment to be first of many engagements for Casa. Turning now to our strategic partnership with Verizon. We remain on track and have achieved all delivery milestones to date. Verizon's confidence in our offering is an important validation of our 5G core and MEC solution and our security gateway software solution as well. And it's a good validation of our go-forward strategy and leadership position in cloud-native 5G core and mobile edge compute solutions. We expect increased GAAP revenues from our Verizon partnership in our second quarter and second half of 2023, given the progress we are making and the positive status of this very important and large partnership. And finally, before I go into the Q1 financial results, I would like to note that the search for a permanent CEO remains active and ongoing, and the Board is interviewing candidates now for this role. We look forward to announcing more on this in the coming few months. Let's now move to our financial results for the first quarter. Revenue for the quarter came in at $45.3 million, which is down 30% from a year ago, while our revenue performance came in slightly below our expectations due to the slip timing of some cable orders due to the uncertainty regarding our term loan B status, including Claro, which we have now closed as well as timing of acceptance of a software delivery for one large cloud software contract. We believe we will see revenue contributions from both items in Q2 2023, and this was solely a timing matter and not any type of competitive loss. We continue to believe that revenue for the year will be within our guided range of $300 million to $325 million and weighted toward the second half of the year, given the timing of backlog shipments, shipments of our new 4G, 5G small cell radio offerings in the second half, later-stage pipeline deals we expect to convert to revenue in 2H 2023 and revenue recognition related to deferred revenues now on our balance sheet. To provide investors with a clearer view of our performance, we have modified how we are disclosing revenue by 3 product lines, which have similar attributes, the revenue contribution by product offerings are easier to follow. Breaking down revenue across our 3 product lines. Our Q1 cloud revenue, which consists of our 5G core and MEC software, our security gateway software product and the virtual BNG routing software was $4.2 million, which was up 86% from $2.3 million in the prior year. Q1 cable revenue, consisting of all products customarily associated with our cable line of business, was $15.3 million, which was down 46% from $28.6 million in the prior year. The decline in cable was largely due to lower software license revenue during the quarter. And finally, Q1 access revenue, which includes our access device products from our 2019 NetComm acquisition, plus our 4G/5G enterprise small cell radio products, was $25.8 million, which was down 23% from $33.5 million from the prior year. Turning now to backlog. We currently have approximately $140 million in backlog product and service orders, including scheduled 2023 Verizon 5G MEC contract billings, bringing our total backlog, deferred revenue and the remaining $92 million of future billings under the Verizon contract to be built in 2024 and beyond to approximately $270 million. As we noted last quarter, we also have approximately $57 million of closed multiyear contracted business for our 4G/5G enterprise small cell radios with a major North American MNO, where we get POs on an annual as-ordered basis. I want to note that this is not included in the backlog and deferred revenue numbers I just mentioned and that these small cell radios will begin shipping in the second half of 2023, pursuant to close contracts we have. As we noted in our fourth quarter call in March, we are continuing to see good improvements in supply chain and believe a significant majority of our backlog will ship in 2023, assuming there is no unanticipated deterioration in our supply chain in the future. Moving to gross profit. GAAP gross profit for Q1 came in at $18.2 million or 40% of revenue. GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at $45.3 million, including $3.9 million in nonrecurring charges related to Jerry's departure as President and CEO in March 2023. And while outside of the first quarter, it's also important to note that in April 2023, we made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by approximately 13% across all functions and geos and to reduce non-headcount costs as well. This is a necessary step to rightsize the cost structure to our revenue levels and was done surgically so we could continue to innovate in cable and cloud, retain our product lead and excellence and capitalize on future growth opportunities. This realignment of resources would help Casa towards our goal of returning to annual net adjusted EBITDA positive results in 2023 and beyond. Our GAAP operating loss for the quarter was $27.1 million. This was primarily driven by our softer-than-expected Q1 revenue results and the nonrecurring $3.9 million charge taken during Q1. As mentioned, the largest cable deal that did slip outside of Q1 is now closed. We also expect to receive formal acceptance on the software order that slipped outside of Q1 soon. And we have taken action to reduce our cost structure in April 2023 as just announced. Further, it should be noted our operating cash burn was very modest in Q1 at only $8.4 million. And this is important to recognize and reflects the high level of noncash charges flowing through our GAAP P&amp;L. Finally, related to our Q1 P&amp;L, our net loss for the quarter was $31.7 million or $0.33 loss per diluted share versus a net loss of $32.6 million in Q1 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, we had a loss of $24.5 million or $0.26 loss per share and reported adjusted EBITDA loss of $16.2 million as reflected in the schedule shown in our press release. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $115.6 million. Our cash balance at March 31, 2023 was down approximately $14 million compared to December 31 due primarily to an approximately $2 million reduction in our term loan B debt, another $2.9 million use of cash for financing activities, so modest fixed asset purchases and the modest operating cash burn during the quarter, as just mentioned. We ended the quarter with high-quality accounts receivables of approximately $47.5 million, which excludes major billings we are in the process of issuing Q2 related to our Verizon contract. Further, I'm pleased to say that our long-term debt, which was $274 million as of 3/31/22, is now down to $223 million, reflecting great progress on our delevering plan. Finally, we are reiterating our annual 2023 revenue guidance of $300 million to $325 million and positive net adjusted EBITDA results for the year. As noted earlier, we expect 2023 to be back-end weighted. And our guidance is based on visibility into our backlog, deferred revenue and later-stage pipeline deals, including large expansion deals at major customers, which we expect to convert into revenue later this year. So to wrap up, the team and I are incredibly excited about the recent developments at Casa. From our recent customer wins to new successful customer deployments to the progress we're making in our important partnership for Verizon, we're on the right path to drive growth and return to net adjusted EBITDA profitability. And we will soon have the December 23 maturity overhang formally resolved with the support of this majority of term Loan B lenders pursuant to the TSA we announced today. I want to thank the entire team at Casa for the dedication to serving our customers and staying focused on our long-term goals during this time of transition. I will now turn the call over to the operator to open the line for any questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperatorWe'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Simon Leopold from Raymond James.Simon Matthew LeopoldA handful of things. One more on the housekeeping front is with the redefined segments, will you be posting essentially a pro forma so that we could see what the trending has been with the new segmentation over the last 8 quarters, just to help with kind of forecasting and identification of trends? Is that something you plan to do or can do?Edward M. DurkinYes, Simon, we'll do that.Simon Matthew LeopoldGreat. That was an easy one. They'll get a little harder. What do you expect for your interest expenses going forward with the new term B? And congratulations for getting that done.Edward M. DurkinYes. Thank you. So I think the interest rate structure is in the 8-K. As we close it later in Q2, it should be kind of (inaudible) plus 6.5%, somewhere around 10%, so slightly higher, but still a very good market rate.Simon Matthew LeopoldOkay. And what is sort of the normalized expense run rate now? Because I guess the recent cuts were done during the current quarter. So really, I'm trying to get a better sense of where do you think operating expenses settle in the second, let's call it, 3Q, 4Q OpEx budget? What are you thinking?Edward M. DurkinYes. So we did do the rightsizing, Simon. It was surgical in nature and it preserved our ability to grow in our core market segments, including cable and cloud and RAN. In total, we took out of -- on an annualized basis, excluding severance charges, we took out about $28 million of expense with the April action. That said, we are continuing to invest in certain areas like cable and cloud and elsewhere. But the annualized savings from that April event was roughly $28 million.Simon Matthew LeopoldGreat. And then in terms of an update on the Verizon progress. I think at the end of the last quarter, there was, I believe, a $120 million lift in the project. You had only recognized a fraction of revenue last year. What are your expectations for how much of that Verizon project is baked into the 2023 forecast?Edward M. DurkinYes. So very good question. We did recognize only a fraction last year. I think we billed them $20 million and got paid from Verizon $20 million in nonrefundable payments in 2022 and only took about $7 million of -- $6.5 million or $7 million. We actually recognized no revenue from Verizon in Q1 2023. So we're just waiting on the formal acceptance, but the project itself is going great. And I would expect more meaningful revenue contributions from Verizon in Q2 and in the second half of 2023.OperatorYour next question today is coming from Tim Savageaux from Northland Capital Markets.Timothy Paul SavageauxCan you hear me okay?Edward M. DurkinYes. Hey, Tim.Timothy Paul SavageauxOkay. Great. So I'm just kind of working through this debt agreement. And does this leave you with -- still with some maturities at the end of the year over the old agreement?Edward M. DurkinYes. So the belief is that we will get substantially all of the term loan B lenders to sign on to this. This first phase was to get the 60% we have signed up today, but there are mechanisms that can be put in place now with this majority to incent the remaining lenders to join in the sense of us and JPMorgan is that, substantially all will sign on. And any type of stuff will be very minimal, if any, at the end of the year.Timothy Paul SavageauxOkay. And as it stands now, you've got 60% of it going out to '27, the $40 million paydown, and about $50 million kind of remaining that you hope to convert to the same '27 status. Is that accurate?Edward M. DurkinYes, that's correct, Tim. But again, this is part of the strategy. And again, we expect substantially all to sign on to this new deal.Timothy Paul SavageauxGot it. A question about the Claro then. I mean can you give us any metrics on kind of the size and importance of that opportunity to you guys and how significant a customer that could be, say, relative to big customers you've had in the past? Or any kind of metrics that you want to toss out there.Edward M. DurkinYes. So it was a great validation of our virtual CCAP core and RPD node, Tim. In terms of size, it was mid- to high single-digit millions. It was particularly gratifying to win that in that we had a deal with some fear, uncertainty and doubt that some of our true challenged competitors were selling after our March announcement. But they have confidence in us, and we're very pleased to announce that win, and we do think there is substantial land and expand inside of Claro as well.Timothy Paul SavageauxGot it. And given the pushouts into Q2, where I'm assuming you might have a fair bit of visibility there, I know you reiterate an annual guide. But given, I think, you have a lot of -- potentially a lot of parts moving in the right direction in Q2, which is revenues up and expenses down, I wonder if you might be able to give us a little more color on what your expectations are here short term.Edward M. DurkinYes. So that is part of the success plan, revenue up, expenses down. I think in mid-March when we gave guidance for the year, we did guide that it was going to be second half weighted plan, but we've got good visibility given the high backlog we have entering the year. The big growth in deferred revenues on our balance sheet, which ultimately will flow into our top line revenues. Actually, a very strong sales pipeline across all 4 market segments: cable, CAD, cloud and RAN. The fact that we're going to start shipping our 4G/5G small cell radios in the second half pursuant to that closed contract. We also got some great expansion opportunities inside some of our largest customers. Again, we're having success with our land and expand cohort sales model that you're familiar with. So I mean, all those factors are going to combine to allow us, in our opinion, to attain that revenue guidance we provided. And candidly, we just got a very high single-digit million cable order from a major customer in North America this past week that will ship for revenue in the second half. So it's the combination of all those factors that allow us to have confidence in our annual top line and bottom line guidance.Timothy Paul SavageauxOkay. Great. And one last question for me. And you mentioned no Verizon revenue recognized. And I realize that's probably separate from cash. But despite that, you put up gross margins in the 40% range in the quarter. I guess, I don't know what a normalized quarterly Verizon contribution is or software contribution. But I guess my question is, if there is such a thing, what should that add to gross -- what should gross margins look like with a more normalized either Verizon or, if you want to say, Tier 1 cloud software contribution?Edward M. DurkinYes. So in terms of the margin, it would probably be in the low 90s as a gross margin as a percent of revenue. From a GAAP 606 rev rec point of view, it's a little complex, but the margins on the cloud side are going to be very, very high.OperatorWe've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further closing comments.Edward M. DurkinNo, I guess to close up first. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Look, it's been a really busy few months at Casa and the whole team is working truly tirelessly to address the issues that were facing us, and we believe great progress has been made. As we enter Q2, we're bringing strong business momentum into the quarter. We're really pleased after a lot of late nights and hard work on the TSA announcement today. And with this term loan B cloud now moving away, we've also engaged Piper Sandler to assist us in assessing the potential for select noncore product line divestitures while we double down on cloud, cable and select access device offerings. And we'll continue to update everyone on our progress during the coming months with more press releases around customer wins and additions to the team that will be forthcoming soon. So please stay tuned, and thank you for your continuing support and interest in Casa. Thank you, operator.OperatorThank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.]"

These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Pensacola include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity as well as C-band spectrum designed for high capacity and wide coverage. 5G Ultra Wideband service is now available around the Cordova Mall and airport areas, downtown Pensacola, Gulf Breeze, and Pensacola Beach. Additionally, engineers have recently deployed new cell sites along Quintette Rd which provides coverage along Hwy 184 from Cantonment to the Pace Florida area as well as Riverview, near the Edinborough Estates, and Fawnwood which provides coverage along Hwy 90 from the University of West Florida area to Pace, FL.Pensacola’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum.  Verizon engineers are using 60 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Pensacola will be able to take advantage of even more spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband.  That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust servicesEven as engineers provide wireless service in more places, they are also enhancing the service by deploying leading edge, modernized technology in the area. Engineers have upgraded the hardware in many of the cell sites providing service throughout Pensacola adding capacity for more data to be used by customers, providing power efficiency, and providing virtualization. This technology milestone allows Verizon to rapidly respond to customers’ varied latency and computing needs, and provides greater flexibility and agility in the introduction of new products and services. The move to a cloud-based, virtualized architecture with standardized interfaces in every part of the network leads to greater flexibility, faster delivery of services, greater scalability, and improved cost efficiency in networks.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Pensacola. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.  Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network.  Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Pensacola area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Story continues“Verizon is committed to delivering the most reliable network experience and meeting our customer’s connectivity needs, no matter where they are. Our reliable, secure network connects families, friends, homes and businesses in Pensacola, FL with our secure, reliable, best-in-class 5G Ultra Wideband technology,” said Eric Lia, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon.With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways.

Highlights of the quarter include:Drove customer engagement with our brands, acquiring over 1.2 million new customers in North America alone, of which approximately half were Gen Z and Millennial consumers;Powered global growth, delivering a 5% revenue gain on a reported basis, or a 9% increase on a constant currency basis, which exceeded the company’s outlook and included growth at each brand;Fueled International revenue growth of nearly 20% at constant currency, led by a greater-than-expected inflection in Greater China, which rose approximately 20%, as well as growth of over 20% in Japan and Other Asia and a 4% increase in Europe;Achieved a low-single-digit revenue gain in North America, ahead of expectations, driven by higher-than-anticipated transactions;Delivered approximately 10% Direct-to-Consumer revenue growth at constant currency, led by a low-teens increase in stores and mid-single-digit gain in Digital, with both expanding operating margin compared to the prior year;Fueled fashion innovation and product excellence to drive handbag AUR gains, including growth in North America, supported by pricing actions, promotional discipline and the Company’s data and analytics capabilities;Reported gross margin above expectations and 290 basis points ahead of the prior year despite FX headwinds, benefiting from lower freight expense and operational outperformance;Expanded operating margin by over 275 basis points compared to last year, led by gross margin gains and supported by disciplined expense management;Delivered earnings per diluted share significantly ahead of expectations and last year, primarily due to operational outperformance, as well as a favorable timing shift of approximately $0.05 with the fourth quarter; drove earnings per diluted share over 50% above last year despite $0.10 of currency headwinds;Maintained tight inventory control, ending the quarter with inventory levels 2% above the prior year; now positioned to end the fiscal year with inventory approximately even with last year, favorable to the prior outlook given the Company’s third quarter outperformance and continued focus on inventory turn;Returned $270 million to shareholders in the quarter and $714 million year-to-date through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.Overview of Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Financial ResultsNet sales totaled $1.51 billion compared to $1.44 billion in the prior year, representing a reported year-over-year increase of 5%. Excluding a 370 basis point headwind from currency due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar, revenue increased 9% versus last year.Gross profit totaled $1.10 billion, while gross margin was 72.8%, which reflected a benefit of 360 basis points from lower freight expense, as well as operational improvements, partially offset by an FX headwind of 120 basis points. This compared to prior year gross profit of $1.01 billion, representing a gross margin of 69.9%.SG&amp;A expenses totaled $872 million and represented 57.8% of sales. This compared to reported SG&amp;A expenses in the prior year period of $836 million, which represented 58.1% of sales. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&amp;A expenses were $829 million, or 57.7% of sales in the prior year period.Operating income was $226 million, while operating margin was 15.0%. The Company’s operating margin was negatively impacted by an FX headwind of approximately 170 basis points. This compared to reported operating income of $169 million and operating margin of 11.8% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, prior year operating income was $176 million, while operating margin was 12.2%.Net interest expense was $6 million compared to $15 million in the year-ago period.Other income was $3 million in the quarter, primarily due to an FX gain associated with the movement of the U.S. Dollar within the quarter. This compared to other expense of $3 million in the prior year period.Net income was $187 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.78. This compared to reported net income of $123 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.46 in the prior year period. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $136 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.51 in the prior year period. The tax rate for the quarter was 16.4%, as compared to the prior year period tax rate of 19.2% and 13.8% on a reported and non-GAAP basis, respectively.Balance Sheet and Cash Flow HighlightsCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $652 million and total borrowings outstanding were $1.67 billion.Inventory of $934 million at quarter-end was favorable to expectations and approximately 2% above the prior year’s ending inventory of $913 million. Given strong inventory control, Tapestry now expects year-end inventory to be in-line with the prior year.Cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter was an inflow of $112 million compared to an outflow of $52 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow for the third quarter was an inflow of $71 million compared to an outflow of $55 million in the prior year period. This included CapEx and implementation costs related to Cloud Computing of $57 million versus $36 million a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operating activities was an inflow of $575 million compared to an inflow of $616 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow was an inflow of $425 million compared to an inflow of $541 million in the prior year. This included CapEx and implementation costs related to Cloud Computing of $206 million versus $119 million a year ago.Fiscal Year 2023 OutlookThe Company is raising its Fiscal 2023 revenue and earnings outlook due to its outperformance in the third fiscal quarter.Tapestry now expects the following for Fiscal 2023, which replaces all previous guidance:Revenue approaching $6.7 billion, which is in the area of prior year and includes approximately 320 basis points of FX pressure. On a constant currency basis, revenue is expected to grow approximately 3% versus last year;Net interest expense of approximately $30 million;Tax rate of approximately 19.0%;Weighted average diluted share count of approximately 242 million shares, incorporating approximately $700 million of expected share repurchases;Earnings per diluted share of $3.85 to $3.90, representing a low double-digit growth rate compared to the prior year on a non-GAAP basis despite a currency headwind of approximately $0.40.The Company's outlook assumes the following:No further appreciation of the U.S. Dollar; information provided based on spot rates at the time of forecast;Continued gradual recovery in Greater China from Covid-related disruption; no further significant lockdowns or incremental supply chain pressures from the Covid-19 pandemic;No material worsening of inflationary pressures or consumer confidence; andNo benefit from the potential reinstatement of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).Given the dynamic nature of these and other external factors, financial results could differ materially from the outlook provided.Conference Call DetailsThe Company will host a conference call to review these results at 8:00 a.m. (ET) today, May 11, 2023.

The Company believes presenting these non-GAAP measures, which exclude items that are not comparable from period to period, is useful to investors and others in evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating and financial results in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance and understanding how such results compare with the Company’s historical performance. Additionally, the Company believes presenting these metrics on a constant currency basis will help investors and analysts to understand the effect of significant year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on these performance measures and provide a framework to assess how business is performing and expected to perform excluding these effects.The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The Company's management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, the non-GAAP measures utilized by the Company may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.The Company operates on a global basis and reports financial results in U.S. dollars in accordance with GAAP. Percentage increases/decreases in net sales for the Company and each segment have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects from translating foreign-denominated sales into U.S. dollars and compared to the same periods in the prior quarter and fiscal year. The Company calculates constant currency net sales results by translating current period net sales in local currency using the prior year period’s currency conversion rate.Net sales changes for the Company and each segment are based on absolute sales dollar changes and are not presented in accordance with the Company’s comparable sales definition utilized historically due to the uncertain business environment resulting from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.The segment gross profit and segment SG&amp;A expenses presented in the Condensed Consolidated Segment Data, and GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation Table above, as well as SG&amp;A expense ratio, and operating margin, are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures have been presented both including and excluding Acceleration Program costs for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2022 and Debt Extinguishment costs for the first nine months of fiscal 2022. In addition, segment Operating Income (loss), Loss on extinguishment of debt, Provision for income taxes, Net income (loss), and Net Income (loss) per diluted common share, have been presented both including and excluding Acceleration Program costs for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2022 and Debt Extinguishment costs for the first nine months of fiscal 2022.There were no items affecting comparability in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023.The Company also presents free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure, Free cash flow is calculated by taking the ""Net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities"" less ""Purchases of property and equipment"" from the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available after capital expenditures for operational expenses and investment in our business. The Company believes that free cash flow is useful to investors because it measures the Company’s ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest in future growth and return capital to stockholders.Schedule 4: Condensed Consolidated Balance SheetsTAPESTRY, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSAt April 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022(in millions) (unaudited)(audited)April 1, 2023July 2, 2022ASSETSCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments$651.8$953.2Receivables 240.8 252.3Inventories 934.1 994.2Other current assets 392.2 374.1Total current assets 2,218.9 2,573.8Property and equipment, net 578.2 544.4Lease right-of-use assets 1,363.8 1,281.6Other noncurrent assets 2,823.5 2,865.5Total assets$6,984.4$7,265.3LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITYAccounts payable$331.0$520.7Accrued liabilities 495.4 628.2Short-term lease liabilities 294.7 288.7Current debt 25.0 31.2Total current liabilities 1,146.1 1,468.8Long-term debt 1,641.6 1,659.2Long-term lease liabilities 1,332.0 1,282.3Other liabilities 601.3 569.5Stockholders' equity 2,263.4 2,285.5Total liabilities and stockholders' equity$6,984.4$7,265.3Schedule 5: Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash FlowsTAPESTRY, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWSFor the Nine Months Ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022(in millions) (unaudited)(unaudited)April 1, 2023April 2, 2022Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesNet income$711.9 $667.5 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash flows from operating activities:Depreciation and amortization 130.5  148.1 Loss on extinguishment of debt -  53.7 Other non-cash items 45.7  71.5 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (313.3) (324.4)Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 574.8  616.4  Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesPurchases of property and equipment (149.6) (75.1)Purchase of investments (6.3) (523.4)Other items 196.5  261.0 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 40.6  (337.5) Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesDividend payments (214.2) (202.8)Repurchase of common stock (502.0) (1,249.8)Proceeds from issuance of debt, net of discount -  498.5 Payment of debt extinguishment costs -  (50.7)Repayment of debt (25.0) (500.0)Other items (27.5) 36.5 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (768.7) (1,468.3)Effect of exchange rate on cash and cash equivalents 0.7  (12.3) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (152.6) (1,201.7)Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period$789.8 $2,007.7 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period$637.2 $806.0 Schedule 6: Store Count by BrandTAPESTRY, INC.STORE COUNTAt December 31, 2022 and April 1, 2023(unaudited) As ofAs ofDirectly-Operated Store Count:December 31, 2022Openings(Closures)April 1, 2023CoachNorth America341-(11)330International6127(15)604 Kate SpadeNorth America2081(3)206International1926(5)193 Stuart WeitzmanNorth America37-(1)36International622(5)59TAPESTRY, INC.STORE COUNTAt July 2, 2022 and April 1, 2023(unaudited) As ofAs ofDirectly-Operated Store Count:July 2, 2022Openings(Closures)April 1, 2023CoachNorth America3432(15)330International60224(22)604 Kate SpadeNorth America2072(3)206International19112(10)193 Stuart WeitzmanNorth America39-(3)36International614(6)59 View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230511005121/en/ContactsTapestry, Inc.Media: Andrea Shaw ResnickChief Communications Officer212/629-2618aresnick@tapestry.com Analysts and Investors: Christina ColoneGlobal Head of Investor Relations212/946-7252ccolone@tapestry.com Kelsey Mueller212/946-8183Director of Investor Relationskmueller@tapestry.com]"

TPR to report year-over-year increases in the top and the bottom lines when it releases third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on May 11, before market open.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has been unchanged at 59 cents per share over the past 30 days. The same suggests an increase of 15.7% from the year-earlier quarter’s reported figure. The consensus estimate of $1,443 million for quarterly revenues indicates growth of 0.4% from the prior-year quarter’s actual.The owner of Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman brands has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10.6%, on average. In the last reported quarter, the company’s bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 7.9%.Factors to NoteA consumer-centric approach, omni-channel capabilities, brand strength and an emphasis on high-growth areas are likely to have benefited Tapestry’s third-quarter performance. Its Acceleration Program has been another major contributing factor. The company has been focused on deepening engagement with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products, and expanding digital and data analytics capabilities.On its last reported quarter's earnings call, Tapestry envisioned revenue and earnings growth in the back half, suggesting a return to growth in Greater China and lower freight costs on a year-over-year basis. For the third quarter, the company estimated revenues to increase 3-5% in constant currency, including gains in Greater China. On a reported basis, it expected sales to be up slightly. The company estimated third-quarter earnings to be 60 cents per share, suggesting a sharp increase from earnings of 51 cents reported in the year-ago period.However, a tough operating environment and foreign exchange headwinds are likely to have been spoilsports. The impacts of higher freight costs cannot be ignored. Meanwhile, any deleverage in SG&amp;A expenses is expected to get reflected in its margins.Story continuesWhat Our Zacks Model SaysOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Tapestry this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.

Taking a look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average, over the course of the past three days and coming into this activity, net-net past three days, still holding onto gains of about 2/10 of a percent. But here, out of the gate this morning, you're seeing gains of about half a percent right there.NASDAQ Composite, you're seeing that higher by about 9/10 of a percent three days, still net positive. And the S&amp;P 500, as well, now net positive with today's move. And so that is the importance of continuing to track this CPI data and any of the economic data reads to see how the market is digesting that. Because without this morning's moves, over the past three days, we would not be in positive territory for the S&amp;P 500 or for the NASDAQ, and definitely not for the Dow as well.So, ultimately, we'll keep a close eye on that. Let's also take a look at the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors here as we pull it up on our handy-dandy heat map. Taking a look at them right now. We're in positive territory across the board. Take a look at consumer discretionary and technology. Consumer discretionary right now up by about 1.2%.Technology also higher by about 1.1%. Speaking of technology, let's go to the tech-heavy NASDAQ. Take a look at some of those mega-cap tech stocks out the gate this morning. Apple, Microsoft, Google, all those up roughly 1%, a little bit more than that for Alphabet, Alpha Google, Google, whatever.Amazon, they're up by about 2.2%. And Nvidia, the chip company, that's higher by about 1 and 1/2% this morning. We'll keep all these movers close in eye. But Airbnb, as we were mentioning earlier on, just to get a quick check of them, at the market open, they are down by about 11.7%, that coming after their earnings report and the conference call.Story continuesAnd, of course, we'll be speaking with Brian a little bit later on this morning.JULIE HYMAN: Yes, we will. And you were just looking at the big-cap tech there?BRAD SMITH: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: Nvidia is the only one that hasn't reported yet. That is due on May 24, after the close of trading.

In its recently concluded May FOMC meeting, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5-5.25%, marking the highest Fed Fund rate since August 2007.In first-quarter 2023, U.S. GDP growth rate came in at a moderate 1.1% compared with the consensus estimate of 2% and the fourth-quarter 2022 growth rate of 2.6%. Moreover, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index, a gauge of future economic activity, dropped to 108.4 in March from February’s revised reading of 109.7, its 12th successive monthly drop and the lowest reading since November 2020.Precipitous contraction in ISM manufacturing and services activities, a decline in orders of durable goods, a reduction in construction activities, and a freight recession are all signaling a recession later this year. Fed Chair also acknowledged that the current banking turmoil in the United States has led to tighter credit conditions, and may impact economic activities.Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, the tech-heavy has maintained its northbound journey since the beginning of 2023. Year to date, the Nasdaq Composite has rallied 16.4%. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 have gained 1.3% and 7.3%, respectively, in the same period.Nasdaq Composite’s performance is primarily linked to the movement of interest rate. The performance of growth stocks like technology is inversely related to the interest rate trajectory. The Nasdaq Composite was the best performer in the pandemic-ridden 2020 and 2021 as the Fed kept the benchmark interest rate to almost zero.Just the opposite happened in 2022 as the central bank hiked the lending rate by a massive 4.5% to combat record-high inflation. The valuation of most of the technology behemoths plunged last year.The situation once again turned in favor of the Nasdaq Composite as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the ongoing rate hike cycle is perhaps reaching its end, although it will depend on the outcome of economic data.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite listed technology stocks that have rallied more than 20% year to date. These stocks have strong potential for 2023 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows thw price performance of our five picks year to date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchuMeta Platforms Inc. META is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its products like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is considered to have pioneered the concept of social networking.However, as developed regions mature, Meta Platforms has taken measures to drive penetration in emerging markets of South East Asia, Latin America and Africa. Of all places, India deserves a-special mention in terms of user growth. The world’s second-largest populated country offers tremendous potential for META. With China off the radar, India can prove to be a terrific growth engine for Meta.Zacks Rank #1 Meta Platform has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.6% and 19.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 12.6% over the last 30 days. The stock price of META has jumped 94% year to date.Fortinet Inc. FTNT is benefiting from rising demand for security and networking products amid the coronavirus crisis as a huge global workforce is working remotely. FTNT is also benefiting from robust growth in Fortinet Security Fabric, cloud and Software-defined Wide Area Network offerings.Moreover, continued deal wins, especially those of high value, are solid drivers. Higher IT spending on cybersecurity is expected to aid Fortinet in growing faster than the security market. Also, focus on enhancing its unified threat management portfolio through product development and acquisitions is a tailwind for FTNT.Zacks Rank #1 Fortinet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 23.1% and 19.3%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last seven days. The stock price of FTNT has appreciated 36.9% year to date.Manhattan Associates Inc. MANH is the global leader in providing supply-chain execution and optimization solutions. MANH develops, sells, deploys, services, and maintains software solutions to manage supply chains, inventory, and omni-channel operations.MANH offers Manhattan SCALE, a portfolio of logistics execution solutions that provide trading partner management, yard management, optimization, warehouse management, and transportation execution services. MANH also offers and Manhattan Active, a set of enterprise and omnichannel solution, which include enterprise solutions and omnichannel solutions for stores. In addition, MANH also provides inventory optimization, planning, and allocation solutions.Zacks Rank #1 Manhattan Associates has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 12.1% and 4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.3% over the last 30 days. The stock price of MANH has climbed 39.2% year to date.NVIDIA Corp. NVDA is gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute &amp; Networking revenues. A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds for NVDA.Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance NVDA’s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect its Automotive segment’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 29% through fiscal 2023-2025.Zacks Rank #2 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10% and 34.7%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days. The stock price of NVDA has soared 95.5% year to date.CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. CRWD is benefiting from the rising demand for cyber-security solutions owing to the slew of data breaches and the increasing necessity for security and networking products amid the growing hybrid working trend. Continued digital transformation and cloud-migration strategies adopted by organizations are key growth drivers.CRWD’s portfolio strength, mainly the Falcon platform’s 10 cloud modules, boosts its competitive edge and helps add users. Additionally, strategic acquisitions, like that of Humio and Preempt, are expected to drive growth for CRWD.Zacks Rank #2 CrowdStrike has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 33.8% and 49.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last 30 days.

However, so few investors are successful in finding a winning stock, let alone holding one. Though legendary investors such as Jesse Livermore, Paul Tudor Jones, and Warren Buffett have differing strategies, they share a common thought process about how to make big money in the stock market.Jesse Livermore once said, ""Those who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon.""In an interview with Tony Robbins, Paul Tudor Jones said he shoots for a risk-to-reward ratio of 5:1. ""Five to one means I'm risking one dollar to make 5.""Buffett proclaimed that ""The stock market is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient.""Though the advice of running winners may sound evident on the surface, in practice, it is a different story for most investors. How can investors find the next big winner, and more importantly, how can they fight the human emotions of hope, fear, and greed and ride these winners?Identify a stock in an uptrend: All else equal, it is easier to latch onto an already strong stock than it is to catch a bottom in a weak stock. Stocks like Apple or Amazon that doubled years ago went on to double several more times. In other words, strength begets strength.Use moving averages: Moving averages can help you in various ways. For example, a bullish ""golden cross"" occurs when the ""faster"" 50-day moving average crosses above the ""slower"" 200-day moving average from below – signaling a bullish trend change. Nvidia, the current market leader, triggered this signal earlier this year.Beyond getting you into the stock, the 50-day moving average can help you to stay in the stock for the bulk of a move. The 50-day moving average is an area where institutional investors like to ""reload on stock"". Thus, the strongest trends are contained within the 50-day moving average. If you can buy a stock above the 50-day moving average and hold until your average cost is below the moving average, you put yourself in a position for success. A good recent example is Elf Beauty.Story continuesLook for stocks with Zacks Rankings of 3 or better: The Zacks Rank grades stocks based on earnings estimates. Year-over-year, the stocks with rising earnings estimates have significantly outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index. By combining technicals and fundamentals, you begin to stack the odds in your favor.Hone your entry points: It is much easier to hang onto a stock if you purchased it correctly. When entering a stock, there is no need to complicate the process. Find an up-trending stock that is consolidating and pulling back to the 50-day moving average. Buy as it breaks out of the consolidation – preferably on heavy volume. A real-time example of a stock trying to do this is Salesforce.Manage your risk: Anyone who has invested in the stock market for more than a few days knows that you will not always pick winners. Legendary investor Ed Seykota once warned,""If you can't take a small loss, sooner or later, you will take the mother of all losses."" Though taking losses is not something investors often talk about, it is a critical part of surviving over the long term and finding investing success. The good news is that if you keep your losses tight and run your winners, you can achieve great success with a hit rate of 40% or even lower.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

Welcome to the FOX Corporation Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.Gabrielle Brown: Thank you, Kiley. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2023 third quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding FOX Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings.Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.Lachlan Murdoch: Thank you, Gabby, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. FOX's strong fiscal third quarter operating results once again demonstrate the power of our content and the brands it underpins and the repeated capability of our focused strategy to deliver solid financial results. In the quarter, we grew top line revenue by 18%, led by the remarkable 43% growth in advertising and a solid 3% growth in affiliate revenue. Underpinning this performance was a record Super Bowl LVII on the FOX Broadcast Network which generated approximately $650 million of gross advertising revenue across our businesses and was the key driver of our 61% advertising revenue growth at our Television segment. This year's Super Bowl matchup between Kansas City and Philadelphia delivered 115 million viewers across FOX platforms, making Super Bowl LVII the most watched program in U.S. television history and the pinnacle of an extraordinary year for FOX Sports.Story continuesThe strong lineup of programming and advertising demand for FOX Sports continues into our fourth quarter, which includes the return of NASCAR the second season of the USFL, the start of Major League Baseball's 2023 season, the finals of the UEFA Nations League and a first for FOX the Belmont Stakes. Leveraging the reach of a Super Bowl lead-in, we launched the second season of Next Level Chef, which promises to be the next big lifestyle franchise from our Studio Ramsay partnership. Our entertainment business also found success with the number one new series and new drama over the year in Accused and the number one new unscripted series in Special Forces: World's Toughest Test. FOX has now debuted the top new unscripted series for 5 consecutive seasons.In fact, the combined power of our sports and entertainment programming places FOX at number one amongst broadcast network season to date in the key 18 to 49 demo. Our strong sports calendar also had a halo effect at the FOX Television stations, which saw many local advertising verticals higher in the quarter. In what continues to be mixed local advertising market conditions, we are encouraged by growth in categories, including auto, restaurants and entertainment, but are watchful across other categories, including bedding, retail and telecom. Meanwhile, Tubi's performance in the third quarter was nothing short of stellar with revenue growth of 31% supported by sustained gains and engagement, where total view time increased 38% year-on-year.And while still early in the fourth quarter, the April results for Tubi show the momentum across the platform accelerating. Having recently marked the 3-year anniversary of our acquisition of Tubi, our progress over this longer-term time frame is just as impressive having grown quarterly TBT by over 200% and revenue by 400%. Just as importantly, the Tubi brand has asserted itself on the broader media landscape. Our viral Tubi spot in the Super Bowl, which received massive press coverage, had almost 7 billion impressions. And our strong growth and engagement has now led to Tubi's inclusion in Nielsen's The Gauge, marking the first time Tubi has reached 1% of total TV viewing minutes and making Tubi the most watched fast service in the United States.And just last month, we announced the formation of Tubi Media Group, under Paul Cheesbrough, which brings together our digital capabilities in a more formalized and coordinated way to help us better monetize our digital touch points across all our FOX properties. We thank Farhad for his entrepreneurial leadership at Tubi over the last 3 years and, of course, before he leaves the business in terrific shape with an outstanding team to drive continued strong growth. At FOX News Media, we retained our leadership position amongst our peers. The FOX News Channel ended the third quarter as the most watched cable network in total day and prime time while maintaining its lead as the most watched cable news network beating CNN and MSNBC combined. Also notably, the FOX Business Network ended the quarter as the most watched business cable network, leading CNBC in total viewers during the business day and market hours for the fourth consecutive quarter.streaming TV moviesPhoto by Ashley Byrd on UnsplashLet me briefly address the settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We made the business decision to resolve this dispute and avoid the acrimony of a divisive trial and a multiyear appeal process. Our decision clearly in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. The settlement in no way alters FOX's commitment to the highest journalistic standards across our company or our passion for unabashedly reporting the news of the day. We're proud of our FOX News team, the exceptional quality of their journalism and their stewardship of the FOX News brand. Whether it be our coverage of politics and elections, world events such as the war in Ukraine or domestic issues, such as the crisis at the border, our journalists bring compelling news home to our viewers every day.The standards behind this reporting are not only what makes us the number one cable news network by the number one network in all of cable. In fact, in a recent poll, 41% of respondents chose FOX News as their most trusted network news. So as we look ahead, we are confident in the strength of the FOX brands and the strength of our balance sheet. And while we are not completely immune to the headwinds facing the broader industry and the general economy, we are well positioned given our areas of differentiation. Nonetheless, you can expect us to be even more focused on our cost base as we look to reinforce our strategy for future growth. We remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value creation through the thoughtful management of our existing business, the pursuit of new and exciting adjacencies and returning capital to our shareholders.With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to take you through the details of the quarter.Steven Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. FOX again delivered strong underlying financials in our fiscal third quarter with 18% revenue growth and 3% EBITDA growth, bolstered by a record-breaking Super Bowl LVII. Our advertising revenues increased 43%, led by the Super Bowl, along with the higher volume of NFL playoff windows and accelerating growth at Tubi. Meanwhile, our affiliate revenues grew 3% on the back of pricing benefits from recent renewals partially offset by trailing 12-month subscriber losses continuing to run in the 7% range. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $833 million, up $22 million over the prior year quarter as these revenue increases were partially offset by higher expenses. This was primarily due to higher sports rights amortization and production costs associated with our NFL, Super Bowl and playoff schedule.The net loss attributable to stockholders was $54 million or negative $0.10 per share compared to net income of $283 million or $0.50 per share reported in the prior year period. The variance was primarily due to other net where we recognize charges associated with the FOX News Media litigation, partially offset by the gain associated with the change in fair value of the company's investments. Excluding these and other noncore items, earnings growth was strong with adjusted net income growing 8% to $494 million and adjusted EPS of $0.94 per share, up $0.13 against last year's $0.81 per share. Now turning to our segments, starting with Television, where revenue grew an impressive 36% in the quarter. Television advertising revenues led this growth with a 61% increase fueled by Super Bowl LVII, which, as Lachlan mentioned, generated over $650 million in gross revenue.We also benefited from 2 additional NFL playoff games, 1 divisional and 1 wildcard partially offset by the timing of 1 less regular season game. Momentum at Tubi remained strong with advertising revenues up 31% to $170 million on the back of increased engagement and stable pricing. These strong advertising tailwinds in the Television segment were partially offset by lower prime time ratings at the FOX Network and mixed base market conditions at our local stations when excluding the Super Bowl. Television affiliate fee revenues were up 9% and as healthy growth in pricing across FOX owned and operated and affiliated stations continued to outpace the impact from subscriber declines. Other revenues remained essentially unchanged from the prior year quarter.EBITDA at our Television segment was up $82 million to $117 million. Expenses increased in the quarter driven by higher costs related to the Super Bowl and a higher volume of NFL games. The increase in expenses was partially offset by lower costs at FOX Entertainment, including the absence of a write-down of certain scripted programming in the prior year quarter. Our net EBITDA investment in Tubi of approximately $60 million was broadly in line with the prior year quarter. At Cable, we saw revenues generally in line with the prior year. Cable advertising revenues were down 7% due to the impact of a softer direct response marketplace at FOX News Media, while being partially offset by the benefit of the World Baseball Classic on the national sports networks.Cable affiliate fee revenues were broadly flat, coming in at $1.1 billion with rate growth broadly offset by subscriber declines. Cable other revenues were up 10% in the quarter led by higher FOX Nation subscription revenues. EBITDA at our Cable segment was $792 million compared to the $864 million reported last year largely due to these revenue impacts along with elevated legal costs at FOX News Media and higher expenses associated with the second season of the USFL and the World Baseball Classic at FOX Sports. Now turning to cash flow where we generated strong free cash flow of $1.48 billion in the quarter, reflecting our normal seasonal cycle of collecting advertising revenues from our fall programming coupled with our major sports rights payments being concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year.From a share repurchase perspective, as we foreshowed on our last call, we continued with our normal cost buyback activity of $250 million in the quarter and deployed $1 billion of additional capital to an accelerated share repurchase transaction. We retired approximately 80% of the shares associated with the ASR in the March quarter and expect the remainder to settle in the coming months. We remain committed to fully utilizing our current $7 billion authorization, where we now cumulatively repurchased approximately $4.4 billion, representing 20% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. These meaningful capital return measures are enabled by the strength of our financial position, where we closed the quarter with $4.1 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt.While this reported cash balance does not include the impact of the Dominion settlement, we continue to maintain a very robust balance sheet that supports our ongoing commitment to capital returns as well as flexibility to pursue value-accretive investment. And with that, let me turn it back to Gabby to open Q&amp;A.Gabrielle Brown: Thank you, Steve. And now we would be happy to take questions from the investment community.See also 15 Best Interest Yielding Checking Accounts in the US and 13 Best Consulting Stocks to Buy Now.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

He may not like what you are going to tell him, but as long as you are not surprising him you will be OK,"" American Express Stephen Squeri told Yahoo! Finance.Execs at media giant Paramount — where Buffett is a 15.3% holder after building an initial stake in Nov. 2022 — must not have gotten that sage advice from the OG investor.And that calls into question what the Oracle will do next with his ownership stake.Last week, Paramount — which has made major progress on the streaming subscriber front with Paramount+ — surprised the heck out of investors like Buffett.Paramount posted a first quarter direct to consumer business loss of $511 million. A year ago, Paramount's direct to consumer business lost $456 million.That's a lot of losses for a business like Paramount+, which had 60 million subscribers exiting the first quarter. But it underscores how costly it is to produce content such as the hit Paramount show Yellowstone while also staying sharp on pricing to compete with fellow streamers Netflix, Disney, Amazon, etc.It's just a brutal business to be in.The fact ad revenue in Paramount's traditional TV business is under pressure in part to macroeconomic conditions only amplifies the losses at the streaming business.""Paramount is still moving through a difficult combination of heavy investments to try to offset structural decline in a weak cyclical top-line environment,"" said Macquarie Research analyst Tim Nollen in a client note.Nollen maintained an under-perform rating on Paramount's stock.Story continuesThe company then surprised investors again — such as Buffett — by slashing its quarterly dividend to $0.05 from $0.24.Buffett loves dividends. He loves collecting the big fat checks from a Coca-Cola and aforementioned AmEx.Now he stands to collect smaller quarterly checks from Paramount, provided he still owns the stock.Buffett is likely to release a 13f filing early next week disclosing movements in his vast stock portfolio. If Paramount isn't in there — or the stake has been reduced — Paramount investors could feel more pain.Buffett didn't exactly voice support for the company at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.“It’s not good news when any company cuts its dividend dramatically,"" Buffett told a packed CHI Health Center.No it's not, Warren.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The first round of the NBA Playoffs was the most watched-ever across Disney networks, and we've been averaging 5 million viewers throughout the first 22 games, up 15% versus the comparable point in last year's playoffs.ABC continued its run as the #1 entertainment broadcast network for the fourth consecutive season. And at our domestic parks, we continued to improve the guest experience with our recent pricing changes and exciting new attractions, including the reimagined Mickey's Toontown at Disneyland and TRON Lightcycle / Run at Walt Disney World. I've been back in the company for almost 6 months, and in that time, we've embarked on a significant transformation to strategically realign Disney for sustained growth and success. I'm pleased to say that the strategy we detailed last quarter is working. Our new organizational structure is returning authority and accountability to our creative leaders as well as allowing for a more efficient, coordinated and streamlined approach to our operations.The cost-cutting initiatives I announced last quarter are well underway, and we are on track to meet or exceed our target of $5.5 billion. We're delivering progress on a number of fronts, including a reduction in streaming operating losses this quarter, and I'm very optimistic about our direct-to-consumer business longer term. Combined, our brands, franchises and robust library are a significant differentiator in this space, and the meteoric subscriber growth we've seen since our launch 3 years ago only further reinforces that.As I think about our path forward in streaming, we have a number of clear opportunities to further position our DTC business for success. First, as a significant step toward creating a growth business, I'm pleased to announce that we will soon begin offering a one-app experience domestically that incorporates our Hulu content via Disney+. And while we continue to offer Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ as stand-alone options, this is a logical progression of our DTC offerings that will provide greater opportunities for advertisers, while giving bundle subscribers access to more robust and streamlined content, resulting in greater audience engagement and ultimately leading to a more unified streaming experience. We will begin to roll out this one-app offering by the end of the calendar year, and we look forward to sharing more details in the future.Despite the near-term macro headwinds of the overall marketplace today, the advertising potential of this combined platform is incredibly exciting. And when you drill down into the details, you can see why. Over 40% of our domestic advertising portfolio is addressable, including streaming, which we expect will continue to grow over time.We're also focused on the growth opportunity in programmatic advertising, and we are well positioned to scale as the market improves and audiences continue to grow. We've added more than 1,000 advertisers over the past year and now have 5,000 advertisers across our streaming platforms, with over 1/3 buying advertising programmatically today.In addition, we plan to launch our ad tier on Disney+ in Europe by the end of this calendar year, which will drive both increased inventory and revenue over the long term. The truth is we have only just begun to scratch the surface of what we can do with advertising on Disney+, and I'm incredibly bullish on our longer-term advertising positioning.Meanwhile, the pricing changes we've already implemented have proven successful, and we plan to set a higher price our ad-free tier later this year to better reflect the value of our content offerings. As we look to the future, we will continue optimizing our pricing model to reward loyalty and reduce churn, to increase subscriber revenue for the premium ad-free tier and drive growth of subscribers who opt for the lower cost ad-supported option.Additionally, I'd like to share a few other key areas where we see opportunities for improvements in our streaming business. First, it's critical we rationalize the volume of content we're creating and what we're spending to produce our content. Second, our legacy platforms enable us to expand our audiences and often augment our potential streaming success while, at the same time, allowing us to amortize our content costs across multiple windows. We also need to strike the right balance between our local and global programming as well as our platform and program marketing.Finally, we must continue calibrating our investments in specific markets, looking at the total addressable market and ARPU prospects and evaluating the profitability potential. All of these factors combined are why we are confident that we're on the right path for streaming's long-term profitability, the strength of our content, the one-app experience and the enormous advertising potential that comes with it; rationalizing the volume of the content we make and what we're spending; maximizing windowing opportunities; recalibrating our investments internationally; perfecting our pricing model; and consolidating our global streaming business under the leadership of Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman, Alan Bergman and Dana Walden. We're doing the essential work now to position our streaming business for sustained growth and success in the future.Turning to our parks. We see this business as a key growth driver for the company. This past quarter, we've been especially pleased with the performance of our parks internationally. We have several international expansions underway that will allow our parks to continue to build capacity and drive longer-term growth. At Disneyland Paris, our Avengers Campus has been a resounding success in its first year, and we have ongoing investment underway there, including a Frozen-inspired land currently in development.Our Zootopia-inspired expansion opens later this year at Shanghai Disney Resort. Arendelle, The World of Frozen expansion, is set to open at Hong Kong Disneyland in the second half of 2023. And Tokyo Disney Resort, which is currently celebrating its 40th anniversary, will be opening the new Frozen Kingdom, Rapunzel's Forest and Peter Pan’s Never Land in the coming year.Regarding our domestic parks, we just announced additional changes coming in 2024 that will improve the experience for guests visiting Walt Disney World, including further expanding access for annual pass holders to visit on certain days without reservations as well as removing the need for an additional reservation for guests with date-based tickets. This is just another example of how we're continuously listening to our guests and finding ways to improve their experiences.And we have a number of other growth and expansion opportunities at our parks, and we're closely evaluating where it makes the most sense to direct future investments. The unyielding popularity of our world-class parks business and our unparalleled content, powered by our brands and franchises, is what sets Disney apart. From the very beginning 100 years ago, our timeless stories and characters have been the key to our success and hold a special place in the hearts of generations of fans and families.We're leaning into this across every segment of our business, as illustrated with our strong summer slate of theatrical releases, including Disney's The Little Mermaid, Pixar's Elemental and Lucasfilm's Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. As we've been looking at the structure of the company these past several months, what's become clear is that there is an enormous opportunity to harness our full potential by increasing alignment and coordination in marketing across our businesses. That's why I named Asad Ayaz our first-ever Chief Brand Officer in addition to his role as President of Marketing for our studios. For years, our businesses have been incredibly successful in marketing our content, experiences and products. And now with greater integration of our touch points with consumers, especially streaming, we're able to be more efficient and more successful in reaching the right audiences with the right offerings from across our businesses.Disney means so much to so many people around the world. That's a privilege we take seriously. And I know I speak for our terrific Chairman, Alan, Dana, Jimmy and Josh, when I say that our goal is to continue finding innovative new ways that allow guests and audiences to have even deeper connections with us. And that's why I'm so thrilled to be taking this more proactive approach to our brand and marketing work.With that, I will turn things over to Christine.Story continuesChristine Mary McCarthyThanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, fiscal second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.93, a decrease of $0.15 versus the prior year, as improvements at DPEP and direct to consumer were more than offset by declines at our Linear Networks business. As Bob mentioned, we are making excellent progress on our cost-cutting initiatives and are on track to meet or exceed the efficiency targets we outlined last quarter.During Q2, we took a restructuring charge of approximately $150 million, primarily related to severance. While we are continuing to refine our estimates, we currently expect to record additional severance charges of approximately $180 million over the remainder of this fiscal year, with the bulk of that additional charge expected in the third quarter. We are in the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation that you've heard Bob discuss.As a result, we will be removing certain content from our streaming platforms and currently expect to take an impairment charge of approximately $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. The charge, which will not be recorded in our segment results, will primarily be recognized in the third quarter as we complete our review and remove the content. And going forward, we intend to produce lower volumes of content in alignment with this strategic shift.Now to dive into our quarterly results by segment. Starting with our media and entertainment distribution business, a year-over-year decline in operating income was driven primarily by a $1 billion decrease at Linear Networks. DTC results improved versus the prior year, and content sales, licensing and other operating results in the second quarter declined modestly.At Linear Networks, results were consistent with guidance given last quarter, driven by decreases of approximately $800 million at our domestic Linear Networks and $160 million at our international Linear Networks. Domestic results decreased at both Cable and Broadcasting. At Cable, this was largely due to higher sports programming and production costs, which were driven by the timing of costs for the College Football Playoffs and the NFL we discussed last quarter, in addition to NBA contractual rate increases and higher sports production costs. Lower broadcasting results reflected decreases in advertising revenue across the ABC network and our owned television stations.Second quarter domestic Linear Networks affiliate revenue decreased by 2% from the prior year, driven by a 6 point decline from fewer subscribers, partially offset by 3 points of growth from contractual rate increases. Rate growth was adversely impacted by 1 percentage point from the timing of revenue recognition from certain non-owned TV stations. Second quarter domestic linear advertising revenue declined 10% year-over-year, although ESPN ad revenue was up 2% or flat when adjusted for certain noncomparable items, including CFP timing.The sports advertising marketplace is currently stable, with quarter-to-date ESPN domestic linear cash ad sales pacing up. However, the overall entertainment advertising marketplace has been challenging. While the weakness has moderated somewhat, we anticipate that some softness may continue into the back half of the fiscal year. But as Bob mentioned, we are optimistic about our ability to continue to be a leader in advertising throughout the business cycle, particularly as it relates to our capabilities in addressable and programmatic. And we look forward to sharing more details at our upfront presentation next week.International Channels operating income decreased versus the prior year, driven by lower advertising revenue, partially offset by lower programming costs.Moving on to direct to consumer. Operating losses improved sequentially by approximately $400 million versus Q1. During the second quarter, Disney+ core subscribers grew modestly with over 600,000 net additions. For international, subs increased by close to 1 million, while domestic subs declined slightly in the quarter from continued impacts from the price increase. Domestic ARPU increased sequentially by 20%, reflecting strong subscription revenue growth. And while the softness we saw in Q2 domestic Disney+ net adds may linger into Q3, we do expect core sub growth to rebound in Q4.At ESPN+ and Hulu, subscribers increased slightly over the prior quarter. ARPU at Hulu was impacted by lower per-subscriber advertising revenue, in line with the comments we made last quarter regarding near-term softness in the addressable advertising space. DTC expenses, including programming and production costs and SG&amp;A, declined in the second quarter versus Q1. Our direct-to-consumer operating results in Q2 outperformed our guidance by about $200 million, due in part to timing shifts of marketing expenses driven by recent slate changes at Disney+ and Hulu. The shift of some of those costs into the third quarter will contribute to Q3 DTC operating losses widening by approximately $100 million versus Q2.As we have noted before, the path will not be linear as the strategic changes and improvements we're executing on take time to deliver, but we remain confident in our long-term trajectory, with continued opportunities to further improve results given our content, duration strategy, planned price increases, expanding our relationships with our advertisers and our ongoing disciplined approach to costs.At Content Sales/Licensing and Other, we generated a $50 million loss in the quarter, a bit shy of our prior guidance that results would be roughly breakeven. Lower results in the second quarter versus the prior year were due to a decrease in TV/SVOD distribution results, partially offset by improved theatrical distribution results due to the continued success of Avatar: The Way of Water. In the fiscal third quarter, we anticipate this business' operating results will decline by $150 million to $200 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by timing of the marketing of theatrical releases with key titles, Elemental, and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, not premiering until very late in the quarter.Moving on to Parks, Experiences and Products. Operating income increased by over 20% versus the prior year to $2.2 billion, with increases at both international and domestic parks and experiences, partially offset by lower merchandise licensing results at consumer products.Our international parks were a bright spot this quarter with strong year-over-year operating income growth driven by higher attendance and improved financial results at Shanghai Disney Resort, Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. At domestic parks and experiences, operating income increased 10% versus the prior year, driven primarily by the continued post-pandemic recovery of our cruise line, partially offset by a comparison to a gain from a real estate sale in the prior year.Q2 domestic parks operating income came in slightly below the prior year but was still up over 50% versus 2019. Results generally reflect the cost pressures we cited in last quarter's earnings call, including wage increases, costs associated with new guest offerings and other inflationary cost impacts. Domestic year-over-year increases in attendance and per capita spending were 7% and 2%, respectively. Per cap growth was more moderate this quarter as we are comparing against the first full quarter of offering Genie+ and Lightning Lane at both parks in the prior year.Domestic parks and experiences operating margins were comparable to the prior year once adjusted for the impact of the prior year's real estate sale. Please keep in mind that in the back half of this fiscal year, there will be an unfavorable comparison against the prior year's incredibly successful 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World. We typically see some moderation in demand as we lap these types of events, and third quarter-to-date performance has been in line with those historical trends. This comparison, coupled with inflationary cost pressures, including from a new union agreement, is expected to drive a modest adverse impact to domestic parks and experiences operating margins in the third quarter compared to the prior year. However, we expect the contribution from continued strong performance at our international parks in Q3 to result in DPEP segment level operating margins that are slightly higher than the prior year. DPEP will continue to be a growth business for our company, and we will manage all of these factors in line with our enduring focus on our guests.Before we conclude, I would like to note a couple of items related to our expectations for the total company this year. For fiscal 2023, cash content spend company-wide is expected to remain roughly comparable to last year, excluding any potential impact from the writers' strike. And we expect that fiscal 2023 capital expenditures will total approximately $5.6 billion. This is lower than our prior guide of $6 billion, largely due to timing of projects at DPEP as well as lower technology spend at DMED. We still expect fiscal 2023 revenue and operating income to grow in the high single-digit percentage range. There are still many moving pieces, including macroeconomic factors, the state of the global advertising market and content timing shifts, which could impact our plans and expectations for the back half of this year. But as Bob mentioned earlier, we are incredibly optimistic about the long-term value-creation opportunities that the changes we are currently executing on can generate for our company, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. And with that, I will turn the call over to Alexia for Q&amp;A.Alexia Skouras QuadraniThanks, Christine. (Operator Instructions) And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.Benjamin Daniel SwinburneBob, I wanted to ask you about what you learned on sort of 2 topics over the last several months. One is around the price increase on Disney+. You've sort of commented that you think it went well. Obviously, we can see the subscriber trends. And you sound optimistic that the company can continue to drive ARPU over time. If you can just talk a little bit about what you've seen in the customer base and reaction and engagement that gives you confidence around pricing power for Disney+ looking ahead.And then a similar question around the cost rationalization and reorg at the company now that you're sort of deep into that. What have you learned about the opportunity for that to drive better financial results for the company? And Christine sort of teased it that there might be more opportunities that maybe exceed expectations, but do you think there's more to do, I guess, is the short question on the cost side.Robert A. IgerThanks, Ben. On the first question regarding price increases, first, we were pleasantly surprised that the loss of subs due to what was a substantial increase in pricing for the non-ad-supported Disney+ product was de minimis. It was some loss, but it was relatively small. That leads us to believe that we, in fact, have pricing elasticity. With that in mind, I think one of the things that we not only have discovered but that we believe we have to do is that we've got to widen the delta between the ad-free service and add the non-ad-supported service because we clearly would like to drive more subs to the ad-supported service, which we did in the quarter by the way, the obvious reason, because the ARPU potential of the ad service Disney+.And in fact, as we look to this upfront and after careful and considerable discussion with our sales team led by Rita Ferro, we see that there's going to be a substantial growth in digital advertising in this upfront, I mean, quite substantial, suggesting for the obvious reason because digital advertising is so attractive to advertisers that there's an opportunity for us to really lean in to ad supported and again, raising our prices on the ad free, keeping the prices on the ad supported relatively modest, maybe perhaps no increases, increasing the delta, driving more subs in a higher ARPU direction. So we're heartened by it, and we are optimistic. And that is one of the strategies that we believe will help lead us ultimately to profitability and growth, along with the second thing that you mentioned, which is the cost rationalization. And I'll tag team with Christine on this.Clearly, we -- as she mentioned, we're on a path to meeting or exceeding $5.5 billion in growth -- sorry, in cost reductions that we mentioned last quarter. That comes in 2 categories: content spend and SG&amp;A. I'm going to let Christine handle the SG&amp;A. But on content spend, we said at the time, most of that will come starting in '24 and leading in -- and into '25 because we were committed to so much content already in '23. I'll let Christine handle the timing of the SG&amp;A reductions and what potential impact that would have. Clearly, again, the price increases, the -- pushing more viewers -- sorry, more subscribers to the ad supported and the cost containment are among the things we're doing to get to profitability.Christine Mary McCarthyBen, I'll just further elaborate on some of the SG&amp;A progress that we've had. And thanks for picking up that I did tease that by saying that we would need to exceed our targets of $2.5 billion. But as we've gotten into this, there's been great cooperation throughout the entire company, which has been really rewarding because we're looking at this. And of course, there's the reality of headcount reductions, and we're going through those. But there's also other things that we're finding more and more opportunities on eliminating redundancies, looking at ways to become more effective by utilizing resources, people and other resources across other businesses.But we're really leaning into all the opportunities. There's technology, which we've also seen a lot of good progress. Some of it will be -- and I say some will be realized in the balance of this year, really at the end of the fiscal year, but the real impact is going to help us in '24. But once again, since we're all into it, I think, once again, having it be company-wide and having it be something that all of our business leaders have embraced, we're looking for a real comprehensive look throughout the SG&amp;A buckets.Robert A. IgerAnd one more thing to add to that, Ben. We launched Disney+ in many, many markets around the world, including many very low ARPU markets. And not only did we launch in those markets, we spend a lot of money on marketing in those markets and we spend money on local content. So as we rationalize this business and we head in the direction of profitability, clearly, we're looking at opportunities to reduce expenses in those markets where the revenue potential just isn't there.OperatorThe next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.Philip A. CusickGreat to see the parks doing so well. Christine, can you dig into the contribution from Shanghai and where that is relative pre-COVID into its potential? And Bob, Florida is such a big part of the value of the company, but you have this political issue that only seems to get more press. It seems like you're stuck with this fight. So how should investors think about the risk, both the near-term and long-term business for Disney?Christine Mary McCarthyPhil, yes, let me address our results at Shanghai. They were incredibly positive this quarter. We've been really gratified to see the bounce back from the pandemic closures that we had. We're not going to get into too many specifics but suffice it to say that the business is doing extremely well on both an attendance and a per cap basis. We see that momentum continuing. And we also have some new attractions. We've talked about Zootopia coming later this year. And we believe that, that is going to drive even further attendance and spending at the park. But Shanghai is doing extremely well, and we've been really gratified to see that bounce back. Like I said, it was closed for quite a long period of time during the pandemic.Robert A. IgerRegarding Florida, I got a few things I want to say about that, Phil. First of all, I think the case that we filed last month made our position, and the fact's very clear. And that's really that this is about one thing and one thing only, and that's retaliating against us for taking a position about pending legislation. And we believe that in us taking that position, we are merely exercising our right to free speech.Also, this is not about special privileges or a level playing field or Disney in any way using its leverage around the state of Florida. But since there's been a lot said about special districts and the arrangement that we had, I want to set the record straight on that, too.There are about 2,000 special districts in Florida, and most were established to foster investment and development, where we were one of them. It basically made it easier for us and others, by the way, to do business in Florida. And we built a business that employs, as we've said before, over 75,000 people and attracts tens of millions of people to the state. So while it's easy to say that the Reedy Creek special district that was established for us over 50 years ago benefited us, it's misleading to not also consider how much Disney benefited the state of Florida.And we're also -- we're not the only company operating a special district. I mentioned 2000, the Daytona Speedway, it has one. So do The Villages, which is a prominent retirement community, and there are countless others. So the goal here is leveling the playing -- if the goal is leveling the playing field, then a uniform application of the law or government oversight of special districts needs to occur or be applied to all special districts.There's also a false narrative that we've been fighting to protect tax breaks as part of this. But in fact, we're the largest taxpayer in Central Florida, paying over $1.1 billion in state and local taxes last year alone. And we pay more taxes, specifically more real estate taxes as a result of that special district. And we all know there was no concerted effort to do anything to dismantle what was once called Reedy Creek special district until we spoke out on the legislation. So this is plainly a matter of retaliation while the rest of the Florida special districts continue operating basically as they were.And I think it's also important for us to say our primary goal has always been to be able to continue to do exactly what we've been doing there, which investing in Florida. We're proud of the tourism industry that we created, and we want to continue delivering the best possible experience for guests going forward. We never wanted or -- and we certainly never expected to be in the position of having to defend our business interests in Federal Court, particularly having such a terrific relationship with the state, as we've had for more than 50 years.And as I mentioned on our shareholder call, we have a huge opportunity to continue to invest in Florida. I noted that our plans were to invest $17 billion over the next 10 years, which is what the state should want us to do. We operate responsibly. We pay our fair share of taxes. We employ thousands of people. And by the way, we pay them above the minimum wage, substantially above the minimum wage dictated by the state of Florida, and we also provide them with great benefits and free education.So I'm going to finish what is obviously kind of a long answer by asking one question. Does the state want us to invest more, employ more people and pay more taxes or not? Thanks.OperatorThe next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.Michael Brian NathansonI have 2. Bob, first for you is what do you think the impact of the slowdown in your DTC content spending will have on global subscriber growth? And then what does the move to one app in the U.S. offers a solution? And Christine, any help on future cash content spending? You said this year is flat. Is this the peak year, and then we start seeing declines from this year? Any help there on future cash content spending would be helpful.Robert A. IgerMichael, when we launched the service, let me remind everyone, it was only 3.5 years ago. So we're still a start-up in many ways. The goal was, as you know, global subs. And we wanted to flood the so-called digital shelves with as much content as possible to achieve obviously as much sub growth as possible.And now as we grow the business in terms of the global footprint, we realized that we made a lot of content that is not necessarily driving sub growth. And we're getting much more surgical about what it is we make. So as we look to reduce content spend, we're looking to reduce it in a way that should not have any impact at all on subs. We believe that there's an opportunity for us to focus more on real sub drivers.And one interesting example, and I should also throw marketing in too, where when you make a lot of content, everything needs to be marketed. You're spending a lot of money marketing things that are not going to have an impact on the bottom line, except negatively due to the marketing costs.One thing we also know is that our films, those that are released theatrically, big tentpole movies in particular are great sub drivers. But we were spreading our marketing costs so thin that we were not allocating enough money to even market them when they came on the service, as witnessed by the ones that are coming up, including Avatar, Little Mermaid, Guardians of the Galaxy, Indiana Jones, Elemental, et cetera, where we actually believe we have an opportunity to lean into those more, put the right marketing dollars against it, allocate more from -- basically away from programming that was not driving any subs at all.So I guess this is part of the maturation process. As we grow into a business that we had never been in, we're learning a lot more about it. Specifically, we're learning a lot more about how our content behaves on the service and what it is consumers want.Christine Mary McCarthyMichael, I'll address your question on content spend. As you know, this is an area that Bob is spending a lot of time working with our creative teams on. But when you think about that $30 billion overall and Bob's targeted a annualized saving in the $3 billion range, I just want to remind everyone that the sports component of that amount is now over 30% just due to the contractual rate increases that we've had in our contract rights, our sports rights.The other thing is in fiscal '23, we said that we're going to be roughly comparable to last year. Remember, last year, we came in slightly below $30 billion, and this estimate does not include any potential impacts from the writers' strike. So we have not estimated that because that's a new development, and we haven't really quantified what that would be because we don't know how long it's going to last. But in general, what we're really doing is looking at a lower volume of content, as I mentioned in my comments. And Bob is once again going through all of the development slates and really looking at not only our Disney branded but also a more curated approach to our general entertainment content.OperatorThe next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich of BofA Securities.Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich CohenBob, you mentioned that in the upfront, you will take a bigger share -- I mean, you'll lean heavily into digital with AVOD. I'm just wondering, in the face of accelerating pay-TV universe decline, is that enough to offset linear losses? Or when will it be enough to offset linear losses and start to drive growth? And in the sub-universe decline thought, just wondering if you can give us your updated thoughts on ESPN and how it transitions or when it transitions to ESPN+.Robert A. IgerWell, I'll address the ESPN first. We haven't really changed our position regarding basically migrating ESPN's flagship service as a direct-to-consumer streaming platform. We think there's an inevitability to that, but it's a huge decision for us to make, and we know that we've got to get it right, both in terms of pricing and timing. And obviously, that has not only a direct impact on the linear channels, but it will have an even greater impact on it if we were to do that.What we see going on at Linear Networks, as you know, I'm not saying anything that you don't know, is we're seeing both sub declines and advertising weakness. And it's created worrisome circumstance for us because it's obviously having such a negative impact on the economics of that business. And that's forcing us to take a look at the cost structure of those channels, which ultimately comes down probably more than anything to spending on programming.The decline in the business is, by the way, something that we predicted starting in 2015, '16, which is why we got into the streaming business to begin with. But the declines that we're seeing put even more pressure on us to turn that streaming business into a profitable growth business for us. And that's why all of the steps that we're taking, both in terms of the organizational structure, the cost reductions, the marketing changes, the changes in how we program the -- lean into advertising. We've also, by the way, Jessica, we've invested a fair amount in the technology needed to serve advertisers digitally much more effectively with automated sales functionality and delivering in a very, very granular way exactly what advertisers want. So we're very bullish about leaning into digital advertising. We're bullish about how we're positioned there. We're bullish about Disney+ and Hulu and that combination by the way. We think that by making Hulu available as a one-app experience, we'll increase engagement and increase our opportunity in terms of serving digital ads and growing our advertising business. So all things are kind of connected, ESPN to the long-term health of the bundle, the growth and the need to grow streaming as a reaction to the deterioration of linear businesses and of course, all the steps that we've been taking to get to profitability.OperatorThe next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays.Kannan VenkateshwarBob, on Hulu, the revenues of Hulu make it one of the biggest streaming businesses around, and it's also one of the oldest services around, but it doesn't seem to be profitable despite the scale. And it sounds like you've made up your mind on buying the rest of Hulu based on the announcement of the combination with Disney+. Does this combination allow you to change the cost structure of Hulu by maybe dropping content spending or the number of titles on Hulu and raising price because it's now a single service? So any color on your plans with Hulu would be much appreciated. And Christine, on the parks, could you help us scale the recent -- the impact of the recent wage increases in Florida and how that might impact the year? And historically, the business has delivered mid-single digit or better revenue growth and EBITDA growth faster than that. You now have a number of cruise ships, more attractions, higher price but also higher costs. So could you help us think about the growth algorithm going forward more broadly?Robert A. IgerKannan, as you know, we have a contractual arrangement with Comcast that will enable them to put their share of Hulu back to us in early 2024 -- starting in early 2024, as, I guess, further right that we have to call their share from them. And it's not really been fully determined what will happen in that regard, except that as we look more and more at the growth of that or the future of our streaming business -- and I mentioned at the first earnings call that I did after I came back that everything was on the table. And in fact, everything was on the table. But I've now had another 3 months to really study this carefully and figure out what is the best path for us to grow this business. And it's clear that a combination of the content that is on Disney+ with general entertainment is a very positive -- is a very strong combination from a subscriber perspective, from a subscriber acquisition, subscriber retention perspective and also from an advertisers perspective.So where we are headed is for one experience that would have general entertainment and Disney+ content together for every reasons that I just described. How that ultimately unfolds is, to some extent, in the hands of Comcast and in the hands of basically a conversation or a negotiation that we have with them. I don't want to be, in any way, predictive in terms of when or how that ends up. I can say, we've had some conversations with them already. They've been cordial, and they're aimed at being constructive. But I can't tell you, and I can't really say where they end up, only to say that there seems to be real value in having general entertainment combined with Disney+. And if ultimately, Hulu is that solution, that's -- we're bullish about that.Christine Mary McCarthyKannan, let me address your question on park's earnings growth and the outlook there. So I think it's -- the way I would phrase this is we do expect a really solid year overall for our domestic parks. That being said, we also expect increased costs. And we alluded to that in our first quarter earnings call. And they're really coming from a few areas most predominantly. One is wages with the new union contract coupled with inflationary trends. We do have some new guest offerings, so there's some incremental operating expenses that come along with those. And we also have the operational support for adding a fifth cruise ship to our cruise line fleet. I think you all know that we launched the Wish back last fall. So we continue to look at ways to address cost management. The team down there has done a great job throughout the pandemic and then coming out of the pandemic, but they utilize a variety of tactics to mitigate potential margin pressures and downside risk across the segments. And some of the levers that they can utilize to really address it are by looking at capacity. In some of our new attractions, they increased the footprint or increased capacity so we can open up the valve a little bit more on attendance and with some new attractions that are more based on newer IP, so that will get more people not only coming in but wanting to come in and enjoy the experience while they're there.And we also are really continuing to focus on meeting our customer needs there. But we think that this is a growth business for us. We've said so in the past. And I do just want to give a call out to our cruise business. That business, as you know, was the most impacted. And we had talked about that. That was going to be the last business to come back from the closures during the pandemic. But that business has come back incredibly strongly over the last year -- or this fiscal year. And even looking out to the balance of our fiscal year, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing there and the reception to not only our new ship but also our legacy ships within the fleet.OperatorThe next question comes from Michael Morris of Guggenheim.Michael C. MorrisI wanted to ask one on direct-to-consumer advertising. And I'd love to hear any early details you can share about the Disney+ with the advertising product. It wasn't mentioned as a driver, and I realize it's early, but would love to hear any early takes there and thoughts about how that might pace over the course of the year.And then second, Bob, I'd love to ask about artificial intelligence, clearly, a very hot topic right now and a technology that seems like it could be pretty impactful to your business, both your ability to use it, but also just given how much intellectual property you have to protect, something that could be a threat as well. So love any takes that you can share on how that would impact the business over time.Robert A. IgerI think actually, Michael, I'm looking forward to a time where maybe AI does earnings calls for me. You probably -- you wouldn't know the difference perhaps. Maybe they'd be better. I don't know.Michael C. MorrisI'd use AI to ask the questions, too.Robert A. IgerIt's pretty clear that AI developments represent some pretty interesting opportunities for us and some substantial benefits. In fact, we're already starting to use AI to create some efficiencies and ultimately to better serve consumers. Getting closer to the customer is something that is a real goal of ours. And we think that AI will provide some great opportunities to do that. But it's also clear that AI is going to be highly disruptive, and it could be extremely difficult to manage, particularly from an IP management perspective.I can tell you that our legal team is working overtime already to try to come to grips with what could be some of the challenges here. And we're certainly not the only ones. I think this is across not only our industry but industries. So I'd have to say, overall, I'm bullish about the prospects because I think they'll create efficiencies and ways for us to basically provide better services to customers. On the other hand, I think that there's a lot we're going to have to contend with that will be quite disruptive and quite challenging. Getting more specific is not something I really am prepared to do right now.Christine Mary McCarthyMike, I will take the Disney+ ad tier question for you. As you know, we launched back in December, so we've just begun to scratch the surface of what we can really do on advertising on Disney+. And we look at this as an incredible opportunity for longer-term advertising positioning.Just to remind everyone, we do have a lighter ad load on Disney+ versus what we have on Hulu. And also notwithstanding the very challenging macroeconomic advertising market, we're still seeing our consumers come into the -- not only existing but also new sign-ups come into that ad tier. So we're very encouraged by that.As Bob has mentioned previously, we have invested a lot in our ad tier technology and our data platforms. We're really providing state-of-the-art programmatic and addressable ad tools to our advertisers. So those are also investments that we've made and we believe are going to pay off not only today but position us well for the future as the ad market overall gets stronger.The other thing I just want to mention is we will be launching the ad tier on Disney+ in Europe by the end of this calendar year. So that will be another platform that we'll have or another offering that we'll have for consumers outside of the U.S.OperatorLast question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse.Douglas David MitchelsonBob, integrating Hulu into the Disney+ app is intriguing, so I wanted to continue that conversation. When Disney+ was launched, you noted consumers should not have to buy through your entertainment content to get the Marvel and Star Wars and Disney and Pixar content. And you thought at the time having separate services to give consumers choice was the right approach. Is that still the right approach, to have multiple services to give consumer choice? And if the answer is yes, but you want the efficiency and flexibility of a single app, that would suggest that Disney+ is finally turning into a platform. And I'm just curious if you see the opportunity to broaden the number of subscriptions that can live on that Disney+ platform or if you can expand the monetization of that platform in other ways, while maintaining a premium experience for consumers. And if I could add one for Christine, is fiscal 3Q the peak for streaming losses?Robert A. Igerwe -- on the integrated app experience that we announced today, that's for consumers that have subscribed to both services for now. So in other words, it's taking what we call the dual bundle and putting it together in one experience, which is obviously good for consumers. Why I have to close out one app and open another one? So it becomes a one-app experience. We also think that it will benefit basically consumption and general lower churn be more attractive. It's just an all-in-one. It's a bigger platform, basically more content than it offered before.Outside the United States, we created that with Star, which doesn't have all the programming of Hulu, but it has a significant amount, and it's working quite well. And it's one of the reasons why we're going to launch that as an advertiser-supported platform as Christine mentioned.So I think to answer your question, we're bullish about an app that goes well beyond the Disney+-branded content and includes general entertainment, which maybe at one point I called undifferentiated. That was a little harsh. But that includes quality curated general entertainment for the purpose of growing advertising, growing subscriber fees, growing engagement, growing a lessening churn, and to address one part of your question, reducing costs.Christine Mary McCarthyI'll answer your question on the direct-to-consumer losses and the peak losses. Just to remind everyone, we did say, and it is the case, that we had peak losses in direct to consumer in the fourth quarter of '22. That was the quarter that we reported in November. So what you've seen since then is we improved on a sequential linked-quarter basis. You've seen a $400 million improvement in Q1, another $400 million improvement in Q2.In my comments, I did say that Q3, it would widen out by $100 million because of the timing of some releases and particularly, the marketing of those releases. But we -- that will be an aberration because it's not a linear path, but we will be improving significantly from '22 peak losses in Q4 through the balance of fiscal '23. So you should assume that what you saw back in Q4 was the peak loss, and we have improved for the next 2 quarters. There'll be that one little blip in Q3, and then we expect to be back on the path for the balance of the fiscal year.Alexia Skouras QuadraniOkay. Thanks for the question.

That was significantly lower than the $850.3 million that analysts projected and less than half what it was just two quarters ago.But a wider loss this period, which McCarthy characterized as a “little blip,” rows back some of the progress Disney has made toward achieving profitability in its streaming businesses. The company is simultaneously seeing a sharp decline in its traditional TV business, which includes ABC and ESPN.To improve the financial performance of its streaming business, the company introduced a new ad-supported tier for Disney+ in December and raised the price of the ad-free version by 38% to $11 a month.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:“2023 is a transitional year with 3Q streaming losses expected to rise to around $800 million.”— Geetha Ranganathan, senior industry analyst— Read the report hereWhile boosting revenue, the move appeared to cost the company customers: Paid subscriptions to Disney+ fell to 157.8 million. Analysts had expected 163.1 million. It’s the second straight quarter that Disney+ has lost subscribers.Story continuesChief Executive Officer Bob Iger said on the call with analysts that the Burbank, California-based company plans to increase the price of the ad-free Disney+ service again this year. Disney also will be removing films and TV shows from its services to reduce costs, leading to a charge of up to $1.8 billion.Iger plans to combine Hulu and Disney+ content on a single app later this year. The move suggests the company will ultimately buy Comcast Corp.’s one-third stake in Hulu. The two companies have an agreement for Disney to purchase that stake starting next year in deal that values Hulu at a minimum of $27.5 billion. Hulu subscriptions were flat in the second quarter.Comcast and Disney have held “cordial” talks, Iger said.Wall Street’s view of the streaming TV industry has shifted over the past year, with investors now focused more on profitability than subscriber growth. Disney’s red ink from streaming ballooned under former CEO Bob Chapek, who was ousted in November after the company reported a quarterly loss of nearly $1.5 billion.Total revenue at Disney rose 13% to $21.8 billion in the period that ended April 1, driven by strong performance of the company’s theme parks. Adjusted earnings of 93 cents per share decreased from the same period last year.The company’s resorts and consumer products unit boosted income by 23% to $2.17 billion, in part due to a return to profitability for the company’s international theme parks.Profit at Disney’s traditional TV business, including the ESPN cable networks and ABC’s broadcasting business, fell 35% to $1.83 billion, the result of higher sports programming costs and lower advertising.Last week, Warner Bros Discovery Inc. and Paramount Global reported significant drops in revenue from TV advertising.Under Iger, Disney has overhauled its structure by creating three reporting units: Entertainment, Parks and ESPN, which includes the sports network and the ESPN+ streaming service.As part of a plan to Disney on a better financial footing, Iger’s cutting $5.5 billion in annual costs and culling 7,000 jobs from the entertainment giant’s workforce. The recent cost cutting led to the departure of streaming chief Michael Paull and most of the product and technology teams that supervised the successful rollout of Disney+ in 2019.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekEric Adams Is Starving New York City’s Universal Pre-K ProgramAI Lets Microsoft Target Google and Google Target AmazonThe Green Energy Transition Has a Chilean Copper ProblemChina’s $220 Billion Biotech Initiative Is Struggling to Take OffThe Plot to Steal the Other Secret Inside a Can of Coca-Cola©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

(NASDAQ:AKAM)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/declining-stock-solid-fundamentals-market-170401145.html,1683738241,STORY,['AKAM'],"[Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) has had a rough three months with its share price down 8.5%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Akamai Technologies'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Akamai Technologies How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Akamai Technologies is:12% = US$524m ÷ US$4.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.12 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Akamai Technologies' Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo start with, Akamai Technologies' ROE looks acceptable. Even so, when compared with the average industry ROE of 15%, we aren't very excited. Although, we can see that Akamai Technologies saw a modest net income growth of 18% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also provides some context to the earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesNext, on comparing Akamai Technologies' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 21% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is AKAM fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Akamai Technologies Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Akamai Technologies doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Akamai Technologies' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

217,81c191b9-12b5-3aed-8d27-a96ef856f44e,HP,2023-05-11,We Like These Underlying Return On Capital Trends At Helmerich & Payne (NYSE:HP),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/underlying-return-capital-trends-helmerich-123107908.html,1683721867,STORY,['HP'],"[Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Helmerich &amp; Payne's (NYSE:HP) returns on capital, so let's have a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Helmerich &amp; Payne is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.10 = US$395m ÷ (US$4.4b - US$414m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Helmerich &amp; Payne has an ROCE of 10.0%. On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 9.9%. View our latest analysis for Helmerich &amp; Payne roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Helmerich &amp; Payne compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Helmerich &amp; Payne's ROCE Trend?We're delighted to see that Helmerich &amp; Payne is reaping rewards from its investments and has now broken into profitability. Historically the company was generating losses but as we can see from the latest figures referenced above, they're now earning 10.0% on their capital employed. In regards to capital employed, Helmerich &amp; Payne is using 33% less capital than it was five years ago, which on the surface, can indicate that the business has become more efficient at generating these returns. This could potentially mean that the company is selling some of its assets.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Helmerich &amp; Payne's ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that Helmerich &amp; Payne has been able to turn things around and earn higher returns on lower amounts of capital. Astute investors may have an opportunity here because the stock has declined 42% in the last five years. That being the case, research into the company's current valuation metrics and future prospects seems fitting.While Helmerich &amp; Payne looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price. The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether HP is currently trading for a fair price.While Helmerich &amp; Payne may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

218,9e042e59-8d38-3724-be2c-fc27a28b9b35,CL,2023-05-11,Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 82% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/colgate-palmolive-company-nyse-cl-110024568.html,1683802824,STORY,['CL'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Colgate-Palmolive's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions49% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholdersOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockA look at the shareholders of Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 82% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Colgate-Palmolive. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Colgate-Palmolive?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Colgate-Palmolive does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Colgate-Palmolive, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Colgate-Palmolive. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.7% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.2% and 6.0% of the stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Colgate-PalmoliveThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Colgate-Palmolive Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$65m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Colgate-Palmolive , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Ultimately the future is most important.

Iger cited the “advertising potential for the combined platform” as the driving force behind the decision.Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesDisney is following a wave of streaming consolidation by its rivals: Paramount+ combining with Showtime, or Warner Bros. Discovery’s announcement of a new streaming platform named Max, which merges HBO Max and Discovery+.Iger’s remark comes as Disney, which has a 66% stake in Hulu, weighs buying the other third from Comcast.As part of a streamlining effort to boost revenue, the company is also looking to raise prices of its ad-free Disney+ and boot some content off its platforms. And that’s in addition to firing 7,000 workers.Will Disney buy the rest of Hulu from Comcast?According to the terms of a 2019 deal, Comcast can force Disney to buy—or Disney can require Comcast to sell—that remaining stake in January 2024. In February, Iger told CNBC in an interview that Disney hadn’t taken a decision, and that “everything was on the table.” However, he has changed his tune since, touting the complete acquisition of Hulu as the best path to grow the business.Standalone options for Disney’s platforms—Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+—will remain. The three services have been available as a discount-priced bundle since 2020, but the streaming experience have continued to be separate, with the content available on the individual apps. While Disney+ launched its cheaper ad-supported tier last December, Hulu’s version of this service has been a benchmark in the industry, with even Netflix tipping its hat to Hulu’s success in the category.Story continuesCharted: Hulu’s solid first quarterdatawrapper-chart-iTViMBy the digits: Disney’s earnings for the fiscal quarter ending March 20234 million: The number of subscribers Disney lost in the quarter200,000: The number of subscribers Hulu gained in the quarter $659 million: The quarterly loss from Disney’s streaming business, narrowing from $887 million during the same period a year ago$21.82 billion: Disney’s revenue in the , up 13% from the same period last year and beating estimatesAt least $9 billion: How much Disney would have to pay Comcast to buy out the final one-third stake in Hulu21%: The quarterly rise in revenues from Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, to $8.7 billion$1.5-$1.8 billion: The “impairment charges”—or reductions in asset value—that Disney will have to bear as it yanks some content off its platformOne 🎢 thing: What’s next for Disney’s Florida parks?Disney amusement-park revenues mostly grew on the back of domestic parks and experiences, which posted “higher volumes and increased guest spending,” the company noted in its earnings presentation.But Florida, home to Disney’s biggest theme parks, is no longer a hospitable state. The rift between Disney and Florida governor Ron DeSantis keeps widening. Yesterday, Iger explicitly asked if Florida would like Disney to continue doing business there. “Does the state want us to invest more, employ more and pay more taxes or not?” he said on behalf of the state’s largest taxpayer.Related stories🧑‍⚖️ The Florida board handpicked by DeSantis called its predecessor a “puppet government” in a lawsuit against Disney🗣️ Disney sues Ron DeSantis on First Amendment grounds🎢 Disney’s feud with Florida’s Ron DeSantis keeps escalatingMore from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowEvery fifth car sold worldwide this year will be electricSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

The Magic Quadrant, which evaluated 18 companies, recognized Oracle as a Leader based on ""Completeness of Vision"" and ""Ability to Execute"". A complimentary copy of the report is available here.Oracle Logo (PRNewsfoto/Oracle)In the report, Gartner noted, ""Leaders combine the uppermost characteristics of vision and thought leadership with a strong, consistent Ability to Execute. Leaders in the WMS market are present in a high percentage of new WMS deals, win a significant number of them and have a large and growing customer base. They have robust core WMSs and offer reasonable — although not necessarily leading-edge — capabilities in extended WMS areas, such as labormanagement, work planning and optimization, slotting, returns management, yard management and dock scheduling, and value-added services. To be a Leader, a vendor doesn't necessarily need to have the absolute broadest or deepest WMS application. Its offerings must meet most mainstream warehousing requirements in complex warehouses without significant modifications, and a substantial number of high-quality implementations must be available to validate this. Leaders must anticipate where customer demands, markets and technology are moving, and must have strategies to support these emerging requirements ahead of actual customer demand. Leading vendors should have coherent strategies to support SCE convergence, and they must invest in innovation, have a proven track record in commercializing advancements and have processes to exploit innovation. Leaders also have robust market momentum, market penetration and market awareness, as well as strong client satisfaction — in the vendor's local markets as well as internationally. Leaders understand the importance of alliances and develop robust ecosystems of partners. Because Leaders are often well-established in leading-edge and complex user environments, they benefit from a user community that helps them remain in the forefront of emerging needs.""Story continues""The last couple of years have recalibrated logistics processes putting additional pressure on warehouse capacity in a tight labor market. To successfully meet and exceed customer expectations, organizations need to be able to do more with less,"" said Derek Gittoes, vice president of supply chain management product strategy, Oracle. ""Oracle Warehouse Management enables organizations to embrace automation, increase efficiency, manage complex fulfillment operations, and gain total inventory visibility—from the distribution center to the store shelf. We believe this report is an acknowledgement of our product strengths, investment in innovation, and customer successes.""Part of Oracle Fusion Cloud Supply Chain &amp; Manufacturing (SCM), Oracle Warehouse Management offers a comprehensive set of enterprise capabilities to optimize inventory, maximize order fulfillment, reduce costs, and mitigate supply chain risk. With new features added every quarter, Oracle Cloud SCM helps customers create a resilient supply network and processes that outpace change.Oracle has garnered consistent industry recognition for its supply chain applications, including being named a Leader in the 2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Transportation Management Systems and the 2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Supply Chain Planning Solutions.For additional information on Oracle Cloud SCM applications, visit www.oracle.com/scm.Disclaimers: GARTNER is a registered trademark and service mark of Gartner and Magic Quadrant is a registered trademark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the U.S. and internationally and are used herein with permission.

The under-$75,000 consumers? The company, he said, has ""maintained our share, but traffic is relatively flattish there.""In Q1 U.S. same-store sales increased by 7.2% boosted by ""continued"" higher prices and year-over-year customer count growth in each month of the quarter. The food chain increased prices for the year by about 7%, higher than about 6% in the previous quarter.CFO Gunther Plosch said the brand isn't really seeing pushback to the higher prices, saying the ""proof is in the pudding."" He added: ""Remember, pricing, the carryover is about 5%...so, the new pricing action is not a lot and again, I think the proof is in the pudding here. We have not seen major resistance from customers on the pricing actions we have taken, as evidenced by the traffic growth that we have seen in the first quarter and maintaining and holding our dollar and traffic share in the category.""Meanwhile, Wendy's is eyeing breakfast as an opportunity to bring in sales growth, particularly with its Frosty Cold Brews, value offerings, and other deals to lure in customers.Penegor said, ""As I look at the calendar for the rest of the year, where we are on value, what we're doing on Frosty cold brews, what we're doing on some innovation...I'm feeling really confident that we're going to continue to compete well.""Competitor Taco Bell (YUM) recently doubled down on its breakfast category and saw a boost in sales in part thanks to comedian Pete Davidson.A sign advertising breakfast items seen at a Wendy's fast food restaurant near Bloomsburg.

Brands:Taco Bell BlogAt Taco Bell, we empower our teams to be fearless, embrace difference and drive change. We believe that each one of us has a story to tell.The month of May celebrates Asian American Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Heritage Month. This month was specifically chosen to honor the first known Japanese immigrant to the U.S. (May 1843), as well as to acknowledge the tremendous contribution Chinese immigrants made in completing the transcontinental railroad (May 1869).AANHPI is a wide-ranging term used to describe all cultures across the continent of Asia and the Pacific Islands of Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia - representing approximately 50 ethnic groups and 100 languages. There is incredible depth and richness of diversity found within the AANHPI community, and this month is devoted to recognizing and elevating their cultural influence.To honor and celebrate this month and the AANHPI community at The Bell, we will share their stories every week in the month of May in hopes that they not only educate but inspire you to drive positive and intentional impact within your community.Throughout the year, we will continue sharing the incredible stories of our Taco Bell teams; the sharing and celebration doesn't stop here.Katie - FSQA ScientistAs an Asian woman, Katie knows the difficulty of the stereotypes that are labeled on her. She describes it as, ""... Asian women cannot disagree with someone because they are seen as someone who falls in line and it's a bias that some may unknowingly carry."" She believes that a step to finding a solution to this issue is having more diversity in leadership. ""Put more POC women in leadership positions. Give them opportunities and resources to grow and develop their careers. Celebrate their success with recognition. Embrace their communication styles,"" she said.Katie was raised to be humble, never contradict, and always be respectful. Although she acknowledges that some of these are good character traits, these traits were not helping her succeed in her career. She found it hard to speak up for herself and did not have confidence in her ideas or opinions. She is still working on her self-promoting and not falling back into her old tendencies.Story continuesThe road to get there wasn't easy, but it was worth it. She attended California State University, Long Beach, and received her Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics. She went on to later receive her Master of Science in Agriculture - Food Science and Management at Washington State University. She has immense knowledge and years of experience in the food industry. If you check out her LinkedIn page, you would be amazed at all her accomplishments.Speaking of those accomplishments, Katie is not only a Scientist on our Food Innovation QA team, but also a leader of the Business Employee Resource Group, Live Más CREAsians, and an advocate for inclusion. ""When you participate in EI&amp;B (equity, inclusion and belonging) initiatives, you begin to view everyday practices differently. It becomes second nature to think about ways you can be more sensitive and respectful to others,"" she said. This role has taught her valuable lessons and she recognizes that there is still room for improvement.""By committing to progressing EI&amp;B efforts at Taco Bell, I know that I am paving the way for others to feel confident in their careers and that their skills are recognized,"" she said. Katie hopes that her progress encourages others that are struggling to find their voice and confidence, and to truly believe that the seat at the table is 100% theirs.For Katie, AANHPI Heritage Month means that her community is being heard, celebrated, and recognized for their achievements. For anyone that wants to get involved, Katie recommends they check out their local advocacy or volunteer groups. At Taco Bell, Live Más CREAsians will be hosting another Fireside Chat with Connie Chung Joe from Asian Americans Advancing Justice SOCAL, a social justice organization that protects the rights and dignity of AANHPI communities. You can read more about her here.She wants future generations of the AANHPI community to have better experiences learning about their culture than she did growing up. ""That they feel not just included but celebrated,"" she said.She is fun, talkative, detail-oriented, and can also be very shy but above all, she has a brave heart that is willing to fight against any bias to ensure that others feel empowered. Katie has the following advice for anyone looking to break out of their shell, ""I want people to reject the idea of what they are ‘supposed to be.' And I encourage everyone to embrace their true self and voice their power.""Yum! Brands, Wednesday, May 10, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Yum!

It’s also sharpening its focus on its leading brands as evidenced by its December announcement that it was selling its Lacoste fragrance license back to Lacoste.

Shares of value-oriented beauty brand ELF received a meaningful boost from normalizing beauty usage and spending in a post-COVID environment, which we believe has contributed to its premium multiple relative to competitors in the beauty space.

Spectrum Brands Holdings (SPB), a household products company, is one such example.Spectrum sells a variety of home goods through its market-leading brands including Black and Decker, Pfister and Remington. During the past 18 months, management has undertaken an initiative to exit non-core business lines such as auto care and batteries, reduce debt and improve efficiencies. The latest of these efforts came in mid -September when the company announced it was selling its home improvement segment for a sum greater than the market capitalization of the entire company.Management expects to use the proceeds to further bolster Spectrum’s balance sheet, continue to buy back shares and do tuck-in acquisitions to increase scale in its secular growth businesses, such as Pet and Home and Garden lines.Despite recent improvements in its share price, the company still trades at a meaningful discount to its peers on an enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization basis.”8.

Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 768,839 shares worth about $108 million. Here is what LRT Capital Management has to say about The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“For several months now, our largest position has been Clorox – the cleaning products company. Besides wipes, the company also manufactures bleach, charcoal, cat litter, plastic bags, and container products. Clorox benefited during the Covid-19 pandemic from an increased demand for cleaning products. Companies and consumers trust the Clorox brand – a source of the company’s huge competitive advantage.United Airlines, for example, chose to partner with Clorox in its push to reassure consumers about the safety of air travel. The company is a typical “defensive” holding – subject to very small fluctuations in end market demand. Its branded consumer products remain in strong demand. Historically (pre-Covid), the company’s sales grew in line with GDP, while earnings-per-share grew slightly faster due to operational and financial leverage. We expect sales will decline slightly in the next few quarters as the Covid-19 pandemic comes to an end, but we believe this decline is more than accounted for by the company’s low valuation.On February 4th, Clorox reported results for Q4 2020, with both earnings and sales beating estimates. Sales grew by +27% (vs. 20% estimate) from the prior year’s Q4, and EPS increased +39% ($2.03 vs. $1.75 expected). The company continues to see robust demand and raised its sales and EPS guidance for the rest of the year. Shares are down 4% year-to-date. We believe the shares are undervalued at 20x trailing and 24x forward earnings and currently represent an excellent opportunity.”6. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) creates, produces, and sells household, personal care, and specialty products. The company operates through three main segments – Consumer Domestic, Consumer International, and Specialty Products Division. On April 26, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) declared a $0.2725 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on June 1, to shareholders of record on May 15. The company also delivered market-beating Q1 2023 financial results. On April 28, Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers raised the firm's price target on Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) to $105 from $96 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 36 hedge funds were long Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD), compared to 40 funds in the earlier quarter. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 8.4 million shares worth $680.8 million. In addition to The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) is one of the premier household stocks to invest in. Renaissance Investment made the following comment about Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc.

He may not like what you are going to tell him, but as long as you are not surprising him you will be OK,"" American Express Stephen Squeri told Yahoo! Finance.Execs at media giant Paramount — where Buffett is a 15.3% holder after building an initial stake in Nov. 2022 — must not have gotten that sage advice from the OG investor.And that calls into question what the Oracle will do next with his ownership stake.Last week, Paramount — which has made major progress on the streaming subscriber front with Paramount+ — surprised the heck out of investors like Buffett.Paramount posted a first quarter direct to consumer business loss of $511 million. A year ago, Paramount's direct to consumer business lost $456 million.That's a lot of losses for a business like Paramount+, which had 60 million subscribers exiting the first quarter. But it underscores how costly it is to produce content such as the hit Paramount show Yellowstone while also staying sharp on pricing to compete with fellow streamers Netflix, Disney, Amazon, etc.It's just a brutal business to be in.The fact ad revenue in Paramount's traditional TV business is under pressure in part to macroeconomic conditions only amplifies the losses at the streaming business.""Paramount is still moving through a difficult combination of heavy investments to try to offset structural decline in a weak cyclical top-line environment,"" said Macquarie Research analyst Tim Nollen in a client note.Nollen maintained an under-perform rating on Paramount's stock.Story continuesThe company then surprised investors again — such as Buffett — by slashing its quarterly dividend to $0.05 from $0.24.Buffett loves dividends. He loves collecting the big fat checks from a Coca-Cola and aforementioned AmEx.Now he stands to collect smaller quarterly checks from Paramount, provided he still owns the stock.Buffett is likely to release a 13f filing early next week disclosing movements in his vast stock portfolio. If Paramount isn't in there — or the stake has been reduced — Paramount investors could feel more pain.Buffett didn't exactly voice support for the company at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.“It’s not good news when any company cuts its dividend dramatically,"" Buffett told a packed CHI Health Center.No it's not, Warren.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide NetApp with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for NetApp How Fast Is NetApp Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Over the last three years, NetApp has grown EPS by 12% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. EBIT margins for NetApp remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 4.4% to US$6.5b. That's encouraging news for the company!In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of NetApp's forecast profits?Are NetApp Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?It's said that there's no smoke without fire. For investors, insider buying is often the smoke that indicates which stocks could set the market alight. This view is based on the possibility that stock purchases signal bullishness on behalf of the buyer. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions.Story continuesOur analysis into NetApp has shown that insiders have sold US$174k worth of shares over the last 12 months. This falls short of the share acquisition by Executive VP &amp; CFO Michael Berry, who has acquired US$360k worth of shares, at an average price of US$72.04. Overall, that is something good to take away.On top of the insider buying, it's good to see that NetApp insiders have a valuable investment in the business. To be specific, they have US$41m worth of shares. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. Despite being just 0.3% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.Should You Add NetApp To Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, NetApp is a growing business, which is encouraging. In addition, insiders have been busy adding to their sizeable holdings in the company. These factors alone make the company an interesting prospect for your watchlist, as well as continuing research. We should say that we've discovered 1 warning sign for NetApp that you should be aware of before investing here.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

This will benefit first-quarter earnings as it reduces the possibility of the dilutive impact of additional shares.Algonquin Power &amp; Utilities’ Regulated and Renewables businesses are well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing transition in the utility space, which is also expected to have a positive impact on earnings in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Q1 ExpectationThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues and earnings per share is pegged at $784.6 million and 16 cents, respectively. Revenues indicate 6.6% year-over-year growth, while earnings reflect a 23.8% decline from the year-ago reported figures.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Algonquin Power &amp; Utilities this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

Keep in mind, Warren Buffett shot down speculation about taking full control of the oil company-- shot down that speculation over the weekend. Ines Ferre joins us now, though, with fresh details from the company's earnings call. Ines, let's get right into this. What are your top takeaways from the call?INES FERRE: Yeah, Diane, the top takeaways are, one is that the miss on the top and the bottom line really overshadowed production for the company, which is something that Occidental Petroleum Management highlighted on the call. That production topped its midpoint production guidance for the first quarter.The company raised its full year production guidance. CEO Vicki Hollub highlighted Occi's strong well performance in the Permian Basin and also Occidental's highest quarterly production in over a decade in the Gulf of Mexico. The second point, and I would say that this is probably the most important point that was over and over talked about during the call, is that Occidental Petroleum is prioritizing spending money on share buybacks.And one analyst asked executives if excess cash flow, whether that would-- whether the company would put that towards share buybacks or, perhaps, towards growth. The answer was share buybacks. Vicki Hollub saying any incremental cash flow that they generate would go to share repurchases and beyond that, the redemption of preferred stocks.Now, it's notable that the company spent about $750 million on common share buybacks. That accounts for more than 25% of its $3 billion share repurchase program. And that triggered the redemption of preferred stock to the tune of $650 million.Now, management has said over and over that their capital is disciplined, their strategy is disciplined, agnostic of the commodity volatility, and that they are very committed to these share buybacks. And then the last thing that I would highlight from the call is inflation-- their commentary about inflation, and basically saying that they are seeing signs of tempered inflation.Story continuesYes, there is still wage inflation, but they are seeing sort of a plateauing, so to speak. And they also talked about partially offsetting inflation pressures by faster completion of pumping, operational efficiencies, and reducing certain operating costs.AKIKO FUJITA: So, Ines, time to get to the vibe check. How do you rate the call?INES FERRE: Yeah. I would rate it a 1 for being on message, on point with the share buyback. That is a priority of theirs, and they will continue to do that. And that will trigger the redemption of preferred equity.So, yes, on point for that. Definitely got the message across.- All right, Ines Ferre with the latest on Occidental Petroleum. We'll continue to watch that one. Thank you so much, Ines.INES FERRE: Thanks.]"

No community should have go though the trauma and evacuation and environmental damage that East Palestine had to go through.""It remained unclear if the U.S. House of Representatives will take up of the bill, or if it can get enough Republican support to end debate in the Senate.The Senate bill would also increase maximum civil penalties from $225,455 to $10 million for serious rail safety violations, and requires two crew members to operate a train.Norfolk Southern faces lawsuits from the state of Ohio and the U.S. Justice Department over the train derailment of 38 cars, including 11 carrying hazardous materials.Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw said in a statement Wednesday the bill ""contains important advancements"" and said the railroad looks forward to continuing talks with Congress on ""achieving a meaningful and effective new law.""Rail safety legislation was introduced in March by Ohio's U.S. senators, Democrat Sherrod Brown and Republican J.D. Vance and has won the backing of all Democrats on the Commerce Committee as well as Republican former President Donald Trump and Republican Senators Mike Braun, Roger Marshall, Mitt Romney and Eric Schmitt.Story continues""We have allowed the rail industry to socialize the risks of their business while privatizing the rewards,"" Vance said, adding that an entire generation in East Palestine must deal with the aftermath of the derailment for 20 years. ""Let's do something here. Let's not rely on vague promises.""The bill would revise existing railroad accident reporting requirements and direct the Transportation Department address any safety concerns with increasingly longer freight trains.Senator Ted Cruz, top Republican on the Commerce Committee, raised concerns the bill is needlessly prescriptive and would give the U.S. Transportation Department too much authority to write regulations.In April, Norfolk Southern announced total accrued charges for the derailment of nearly $400 million - a figure that the company said on Tuesday ""does not include expected costs for funds relating to property value diminution, long-term healthcare, or water treatment."" Therailroad committed Tuesday tocreating a fund to address the impact on home values for residents near the derailment site.The Association of American Railroads said it supported some aspects of the bill but raised concerns including provisions ""that mandate crew staffing models, expand hazmat transportation operating requirements, micromanage detector networks, and unnecessarily broaden manual inspections.""

Even though oil price has declined (down 5.7% in the January-March period) due to recession fears, it remains high. Since fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player, an uptick in fuel costs is not a welcome development. Operating expenses are on the way up, given the rise in fuel cost.Partly due to these headwinds, the industry has declined 3.9% over the past six months, underperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 4% appreciation and 0.7% decline of the broader Zacks Transportation sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite the challenges surrounding the industry,some railroad companies like Union Pacific Corporation UNP and Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC have consistently announced dividend hikes, thus highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility.

He may not like what you are going to tell him, but as long as you are not surprising him you will be OK,"" American Express Stephen Squeri told Yahoo! Finance.Execs at media giant Paramount — where Buffett is a 15.3% holder after building an initial stake in Nov. 2022 — must not have gotten that sage advice from the OG investor.And that calls into question what the Oracle will do next with his ownership stake.Last week, Paramount — which has made major progress on the streaming subscriber front with Paramount+ — surprised the heck out of investors like Buffett.Paramount posted a first quarter direct to consumer business loss of $511 million. A year ago, Paramount's direct to consumer business lost $456 million.That's a lot of losses for a business like Paramount+, which had 60 million subscribers exiting the first quarter. But it underscores how costly it is to produce content such as the hit Paramount show Yellowstone while also staying sharp on pricing to compete with fellow streamers Netflix, Disney, Amazon, etc.It's just a brutal business to be in.The fact ad revenue in Paramount's traditional TV business is under pressure in part to macroeconomic conditions only amplifies the losses at the streaming business.""Paramount is still moving through a difficult combination of heavy investments to try to offset structural decline in a weak cyclical top-line environment,"" said Macquarie Research analyst Tim Nollen in a client note.Nollen maintained an under-perform rating on Paramount's stock.Story continuesThe company then surprised investors again — such as Buffett — by slashing its quarterly dividend to $0.05 from $0.24.Buffett loves dividends. He loves collecting the big fat checks from a Coca-Cola and aforementioned AmEx.Now he stands to collect smaller quarterly checks from Paramount, provided he still owns the stock.Buffett is likely to release a 13f filing early next week disclosing movements in his vast stock portfolio. If Paramount isn't in there — or the stake has been reduced — Paramount investors could feel more pain.Buffett didn't exactly voice support for the company at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.“It’s not good news when any company cuts its dividend dramatically,"" Buffett told a packed CHI Health Center.No it's not, Warren.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now, DaVita HealthCare is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Chemed has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that DVA is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.DVA currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.99, while CHE has a forward P/E of 26.19. We also note that DVA has a PEG ratio of 2.02. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. CHE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.97.Another notable valuation metric for DVA is its P/B ratio of 8.95. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CHE has a P/B of 9.32.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to DVA's Value grade of A and CHE's Value grade of C.DVA stands above CHE thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that DVA is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(DVA) could be a good stock pick from a technical perspective. DVA recently experienced a ""golden cross"" event, which saw its 50-day simple moving average breaking out above its 200-day simple moving average.There's a reason traders love a golden cross -- it's a technical chart pattern that can indicate a bullish breakout is on the horizon. This kind of crossover is formed when a stock's short-term moving average breaks above a longer-term moving average. Typically, a golden cross involves the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.A successful golden cross event has three stages. It first begins when a stock's price on the decline bottoms out. Then, its shorter moving average crosses above its longer moving average, triggering a positive trend reversal. The third and final phase occurs when the stock maintains its upward momentum.This kind of chart pattern is the opposite of a death cross, which is a technical event that suggests future bearish price movement.DVA could be on the verge of a breakout after moving 18.9% higher over the last four weeks. Plus, the company is currently a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank.The bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account DVA's positive earnings outlook for the current quarter.

269,85ac1679-78b2-325c-b125-4b636e012a23,VMC,2023-05-11,Vulcan (VMC) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vulcan-vmc-incredible-growth-stock-164504783.html,1683737104,STORY,['VMC'],"[Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Our proprietary system currently recommends Vulcan Materials (VMC) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this construction materials company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Vulcan is 7.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 23.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 11.3%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Vulcan is 17.3%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -4%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 13.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Vulcan have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 6.4% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Vulcan a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Vulcan is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

272,616219a6-15a6-3d8a-b22c-8d19f952038b,UNH,2023-05-11,Here's Why UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) Has Caught The Eye Of Investors,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-unitedhealth-group-nyse-110032967.html,1683802832,STORY,['UNH'],"[For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How Quickly Is UnitedHealth Group Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Over the last three years, UnitedHealth Group has grown EPS by 15% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Our analysis has highlighted that UnitedHealth Group's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. EBIT margins for UnitedHealth Group remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 13% to US$336b. That's a real positive.Story continuesIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for UnitedHealth Group's future EPS 100% free.Are UnitedHealth Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$456b company like UnitedHealth Group. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$1.5b. This comes in at 0.3% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Is UnitedHealth Group Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for UnitedHealth Group is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. Before you take the next step you should know about the 1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group that we have uncovered.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

According to our estimates, cloud revenues are expected to witness a 3.3% rise in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022. This apart, strength across the local consumer services and Cainiao logistics services, Alibaba Health and Freshippo is contributing well.However, uncertainties associated with Covid-related issues in its home country remain major concerns, especially domestically.

275,a4c0b368-4328-4af8-899a-968cbbbbcb3f,PG,2023-05-11,Wealthy Americans are getting hit hardest by the economy slowing down,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wealthy-americans-are-getting-hit-hardest-by-the-economy-slowing-down-160522161.html,1683734722,STORY,"['BAC', 'LOW', 'TGT', 'HD', 'AMZN', 'MMM', 'PG']","[Wealthier Americans aren't spending — or earning—like they used to.Data from Bank of America Institute out Wednesday reveals households making more than $125,000 have seen wage growth slow down faster than lower-income households while spending trends have followed a similar pattern. Higher-income households' discretionary spending on Bank of America credit and debit cards has slipped below lower- and middle-income groups since the start of this year.The data is notable, Bank of America argues, because the highest-earning 40% of households by income accounts for more than 60% of overall consumer spending. Its calculation of wages includes bonuses, which tend to fluctuate more than base pay.“A labor market slowdown driven by the higher end of the income scale could have an outsized impact on the overall economy,” BofA wrote in a note to clients. “As of now, the labor market is beginning to soften from a very buoyant initial position, so it will likely take quite some time before the full impact on consumer spending comes through.”While unemployment remains at historically low levels, Bank of America says unemployment benefit claims are rising the fastest in the highest income group. Higher income houses filing for unemployment benefits rose 40% in April from the same month a year prior — more than five times the rate of the lower income bracket, according to BofA internal data on direct deposits into customer accounts in 30 states.So while the April jobs report showed an overall resilient labor market coming in hotter-than-expected for the 13th straight month, BofA’s data shows the cracks are occurring in the highest income bracket, where headlines of layoffs have littered the tech industry for months.Bank of America Institute data shows households making more than $125,000 are seeing wage growth decline faster than any other income cohort.Overall, total card spend declined on a yearly basis in April for the first time since February 2021, per Bank of America data. Within retail, luxury fashion is one the biggest laggards, falling 15% compared to 2022. In services, lodging fell more than 3% compared to last year while spending at airlines dropped 4.5% compared to the month prior.Story continuesWhile savings and checking balances at Bank of America still remain over 40% higher than pre-pandemic levels, the slowing trends in spending fit in line with other economic data from pervious months and commentary from quarterly earnings calls.Retail sales fell double what analysts had predicted in March, as some economists pointed out the picture was only growing worse.“Monthly data suggest that consumer spending has lost momentum over the past few months,” Jay Bryson Wells Fargo Chief Economist said in a note on April 27. “Moreover, consumers are relying increasingly on credit and stockpiled cash to finance their purchases. These factors are not sustainable, in our view.”“We continue to forecast that the U.S. economy slip into recession, which we expect will be of moderate severity, in the second half of the year.”Procter &amp; Gamble's Dawn and Bounty are seen in a store in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly (Andrew Kelly / reuters)'A cautious consumer' Some of America’s largest consumer brands flashed similar warning signals during their earnings calls. Amazon (AMZN) warned of “cautious spending.” 3M Company (MMM) sees weakness in ""consumer-facing markets."" And Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) said its “more careful” consumers are conserving sheets of paper towels.The gloomy outlooks come as several big box retailers still haven’t reported earnings. Home Depot (HD), Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are all expected to report first-quarter earnings next week.And while earnings have widely beat the Street’s muted first quarter expectations, investors will closely watch what each company says about the remaining nine months of 2023.“The earnings season in retailers is going to provide the most opportunity, in my opinion, for the individual investor in terms of where to see what comes next, and the most important part are going to be those CEO comments.,” JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America, told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday.Josh is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Revenue growth management initiatives led to double-digit pricing gains worldwide in the first quarter of 2023. This led to the impressive quarterly results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company witnessed growth in all divisions and all four categories. Net sales of $4,770 million increased 8.5% from the year-ago quarter and beat our estimate of $4,502.2 million. On an organic basis, sales advanced 10%, with improvements in all divisions and categories. This marked the 17th successive quarter of organic sales growth at or above its long-term target of 3-5% growth.Colgate’s innovation strategy is focused on growing in adjacent categories and product segments. It is also focused on the premiumization of its Oral Care portfolio through major innovations. Backed by premium innovation, products, including CO. by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste, and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste have been performing well.The company is on track to launch Optic White Renewal and then Optify Pro Series in the United States or the new MPS whitening technology to drive long-term growth. Its at-home whitening and professional whitening products also bode well.Some notable efforts include the continued expansion of the Naturals and Therapeutics divisions, the Hello Products LLC buyout, and a partnership with Philips to introduce electric toothbrushes in Latin America under a co-brand, namely Philips Colgate.The company is aggressively expanding the geographic footprint of its brands, along with enhanced distribution to faster growth channels. It has expanded its portfolio by introducing pharmacy brands like elmex and meridol to newer markets. Its professional skincare businesses — Elta MD and PCA Skin — are performing well in spas and dermatology clinics.Colgate also expanded its premium skincare portfolio with the buyout of the Filorga skincare business. It is gaining from strong market share gains in North America and China, its two largest markets, with increased share gains across all other regions.The company’s Hill's business has been witnessing a sales momentum, with sales growth of 21.5% in the first quarter and organic sales growth of 14%. Results gained from an 11.5% increase in pricing, volume growth of 12% on a reported basis and 2.5% on an organic volume basis, partly offset by a 2% adverse currency impact. Organic sales were aided by gains in the United States and Europe. Strength in oral care and pet nutrition remain key growth drivers.Colgate’s newly launched Prescription, Diet Derm Complete, has been gaining market share and is likely to be rolled out internationally in the coming quarters. It also remains focused on expanding the availability of its products through the e-commerce channel, as more consumers are using online services for their essential needs.Driven by these factors, management raised its sales and profit forecast for 2023. Colgate anticipates net sales growth of 3-6% compared with the previously mentioned 2-5%. The current projection indicates gains from the acquisitions of pet food businesses, offset by a low-single-digit adverse currency impact.The company anticipates full-year organic sales growth between 4% and 6% compared with the earlier mentioned 3-5%. It also foresees adjusted gross profit margin expansion and increased advertising investment. Management expects mid-single-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share compared with the prior mentioned low to mid-single-digit increase.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research We note that shares of Colgate have gained 5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 6.4%.However, CL has been reeling under elevated raw and packaging material and logistics costs. In first-quarter 2023, the gross margin contracted 160 basis points (bps) to 56.9% on both GAAP and an adjusted basis. This includes an adverse impact of 90 bps from private-label sales resulting from the previously disclosed acquisitions of pet food businesses. The adjusted operating margin contracted 40 bps to 19.1%. Also, selling, general and administrative expenses grew 7.1% year over year to $1,758 million.Consequently, the bottom line declined 1% year over year to 73 cents. On a GAAP basis, earnings plunged 32% to a penny per share.ConclusionWe believe that Colgate’s strategic efforts, including product innovation, brand strength and expansion plans, will help offset cost headwinds and drive further growth. A VGM Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2% raise optimism for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

Spectrum Brands Holdings (SPB), a household products company, is one such example.Spectrum sells a variety of home goods through its market-leading brands including Black and Decker, Pfister and Remington. During the past 18 months, management has undertaken an initiative to exit non-core business lines such as auto care and batteries, reduce debt and improve efficiencies. The latest of these efforts came in mid -September when the company announced it was selling its home improvement segment for a sum greater than the market capitalization of the entire company.Management expects to use the proceeds to further bolster Spectrum’s balance sheet, continue to buy back shares and do tuck-in acquisitions to increase scale in its secular growth businesses, such as Pet and Home and Garden lines.Despite recent improvements in its share price, the company still trades at a meaningful discount to its peers on an enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization basis.”8.

Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 768,839 shares worth about $108 million. Here is what LRT Capital Management has to say about The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“For several months now, our largest position has been Clorox – the cleaning products company. Besides wipes, the company also manufactures bleach, charcoal, cat litter, plastic bags, and container products. Clorox benefited during the Covid-19 pandemic from an increased demand for cleaning products. Companies and consumers trust the Clorox brand – a source of the company’s huge competitive advantage.United Airlines, for example, chose to partner with Clorox in its push to reassure consumers about the safety of air travel. The company is a typical “defensive” holding – subject to very small fluctuations in end market demand. Its branded consumer products remain in strong demand. Historically (pre-Covid), the company’s sales grew in line with GDP, while earnings-per-share grew slightly faster due to operational and financial leverage. We expect sales will decline slightly in the next few quarters as the Covid-19 pandemic comes to an end, but we believe this decline is more than accounted for by the company’s low valuation.On February 4th, Clorox reported results for Q4 2020, with both earnings and sales beating estimates. Sales grew by +27% (vs. 20% estimate) from the prior year’s Q4, and EPS increased +39% ($2.03 vs. $1.75 expected). The company continues to see robust demand and raised its sales and EPS guidance for the rest of the year. Shares are down 4% year-to-date. We believe the shares are undervalued at 20x trailing and 24x forward earnings and currently represent an excellent opportunity.”6. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc.

The company operates through three main segments – Consumer Domestic, Consumer International, and Specialty Products Division. On April 26, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc.

But every investor is virtually certain to have both over-performing and under-performing stocks. So we wouldn't blame long term Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 32% over a half decade. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 20% in the last 90 days. We note that the company has reported results fairly recently; and the market is hardly delighted. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. View our latest analysis for Stericycle In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Stericycle moved from a loss to profitability. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.It could be that the revenue decline of 7.5% per year is viewed as evidence that Stericycle is shrinking. This has probably encouraged some shareholders to sell down the stock.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsStory continuesA Different PerspectiveStericycle shareholders are down 5.9% for the year, but the market itself is up 6.3%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. However, the loss over the last year isn't as bad as the 6% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. We'd need to see some sustained improvements in the key metrics before we could muster much enthusiasm. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is American Airlines (AAL). AAL is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 4.79 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 8.62. Over the past 52 weeks, AAL's Forward P/E has been as high as 1,013.80 and as low as -88.98, with a median of 11.51.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. AAL has a P/S ratio of 0.18. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.43.Finally, we should also recognize that AAL has a P/CF ratio of 2.32.

AAL's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 8.54.

The carbon saving will help us reach our corporate sustainability goal of reducing our carbon footprint towards net zero.""Eaton's Le Mont-sur-Lausanne office (1,650 m²) forms part of a mixed-use building, which also contains a kindergarten, a shop, and underground parking. The Buildings as a Grid approach that Eaton has implemented there comprises a 100 kWp rooftop solar PV array, an Eaton xStorage battery energy storage system (20 kW power and 21 kWh capacity), 16 EV chargers located in Eaton's underground parking garage, and a DC fast charger located adjacent to the parking bays outside the building for the public to use.Eaton's proprietary Buildings Energy Management System (BEMS) software is used to optimise the use of all the solar energy generated from the rooftop array. Powerful algorithms within the software automatically direct power to where it is most needed for EV charging and other electrical requirements in the building, with any surplus stored in the xStorage battery to substitute power from the grid when prices are highest at times of peak demand. Surplus can alternatively be sold to the grid, if required, with resulting revenue used to offset energy bills.Story continuesSince July 2022, the Buildings as a Grid approach at Le Mont-sur-Lausanne has been monitored. Statistics were collated for the period from July to December 2022 to show how money and carbon emissions were saved by offsetting the power the building needed from the grid with renewable energy from the solar panels. Eaton was aware that the Le Mont-sur-Lausanne building must also be energy efficient to perform successfully as an energy hub, so the company asked its new partner, IES, the world-renowned building analytics firm, to develop a digital twin of the building to interrogate the infrastructure and work out how even more energy savings could be made.The digital twin showed how energy and carbon emissions could be reduced by a further 30% representing a total cost saving of 1,540CHF (approximately €1,550) per year, while at the same time enhancing the comfort of the building's users through measures such as optimal use of window shading to maximise daylight use and prevent solar heat gain.A digital twin is a 3D digital representation of a built environment asset - a building or its supporting infrastructure, for example - that can be interrogated by running various scenarios to inform decisions about its future. Learning from the asset's past performance leads to better decision-making when developing a roadmap for its future.Richard Fletcher, chief revenue officer at IES, explained that: ""Digital twins are key to our work with Eaton because they respond and behave like their real-world counterparts, translating data into essential decision-support information. For Eaton's customers, we will examine how a building is used, with a focus on both energy efficiency and user comfort, before constructing a digital twin to forecast the potential reduction in the building's energy demand, as well as energy savings and payback periods from various applications of Eaton's Buildings as a Grid approach.""Contact Eaton to learn more about the Buildings as a Grid approach, and discover how its ecosystem transforms both new buildings and renovation projects into energy hubs that optimise energy consumption while at the same time supporting a flexible, scalable EV charging infrastructure, renewable energy generation, and energy storage.About EatonEaton is an intelligent power management company dedicated to improving the quality of life and protecting the environment for people everywhere.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Aflac's shares before the 16th of May to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of June.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.42 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.68 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Aflac stock has a trailing yield of around 2.5% on the current share price of $66.72. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Aflac can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for Aflac If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Aflac has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 23% of its income after tax.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. This is why it's a relief to see Aflac earnings per share are up 4.3% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Aflac has delivered an average of 9.8% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpHas Aflac got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? It has been growing its earnings per share somewhat in recent years, although it reinvests more than half its earnings in the business, which could suggest there are some growth projects that have not yet reached fruition. Overall, Aflac looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. For example - Aflac has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

However, the bottom line slipped 1.9% year over year.Adjusted operating revenues fell 1.3% year over year to $4,657 million. Yet, the top beat the consensus mark by a whisker.The quarterly results benefited on the back of new business growth and the solid contribution from the Group Protection segment. However, the upside was partly offset by an elevated expense level resulting from the adoption of adverse Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 that gave rise to a new accounting for market risk benefits (“MRBs”).Lincoln National Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseLincoln National Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseLincoln National Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Lincoln National Corporation QuoteCosts and ExpensesTotal expenses escalated 72.8% year over year to $4,984 million in the quarter under review due to the incidence of a significant MRB loss. Benefits account for 46% of the quarter’s overall costs.Segmental UpdateThe Annuities segment recorded an operating income of $274 million, which decreased 14% year over year and came higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $271 million. The metric suffered from reduced fee income resulting from unfavorable capital markets. Operating revenues of $1,141 million dipped 0.5% year over year and lagged the consensus mark of $1,175 million. Total annuity deposits advanced 17% year over year to $3,164 million in the quarter under review on the back of higher sales in fixed and indexed variable annuities.Operating income in the Retirement Plan Services segment came in at $43 million, which plunged 26% year over year due to a decline in prepayment income and an elevated expense level. The reported figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $52 million. Operating revenues of $328 million grew 3.1% year over year in the first quarter and outpaced the consensus mark of $323 million. Total deposits tumbled 11.8% year over year to $3,209 million.Story continuesThe Life Insurance segment incurred an operating loss of $13 million in the quarter under review against the prior-year quarter’s operating income of $23 million. The decline was due to run-rate impact stemming from the third-quarter 2022 annual review of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and reserve assumptions of Lincoln National coupled with reduced alternative investment income and prepayment income. Operating revenues of $1,757 million inched up 1.6% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,721 million. Total Life Insurance sales dropped 16.1% year over year to $130 million due to a decline in Variable Universal Life, Executive Benefits and Term product sales. Total deposits of $1,320 million fell 2.3% year over year in the first quarter.The Group Protection segment recorded an operating income of $71 million in the quarter under review against the prior-year quarter’s loss of $46 million. This significant improvement can be attributed to better disability underwriting results and declining COVID mortality claims. The reported figure outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $42.2 million.Operating revenues increased 6.5% year over year to $1,388 million, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,358 million. Insurance premiums of $1,251 million rose 7% year over year.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Potato Chip Brands and Companies in the World.Potato chips, the world's most popular snack food, are devoured by many. Statistics from IRI, a data analytics and market research company in Chicago, suggest that as of 17th April 2022, potato chips were the most popular type of salty snack, with sales totaling a staggering $8.9 billion.According to an industry analysis report by Research and Markets, the global potato chip market size was valued at $32.2 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.24% from 2021 through 2027, reaching a value of $39 billion at the end of the forecasted period.The market’s expansion is anticipated to be primarily driven by the popularity of snack foods, an increasing demand for a quick snack, and more hectic lifestyles. Moreover, potatoes, oil, and salt are the primary ingredients required in the production of potato chips, and all three are easily accessible around the world. This aids the potato chip sector by ensuring a steady supply of ingredients.The report also emphasized that developing countries are expected to dominate the global potato chip industry due to the increasing westernization of food, the expansion of the middle class, and rising urbanization. With the development of infrastructure, such as metro stations, theaters, and airports, it is predicted that demand will keep rising in these countries. The report further pointed out that plain potato chips are the most popular kind and in terms of potato chip sales, the United States is the largest market.Although there will always be a market for potato chips, more and more individuals are beginning to appreciate the benefits of nutritious snacks. Due to their high concentration of refined carbohydrates, fat, and salt, eating potato chips has been linked to weight gain. Also, since they are typically fried, they include more calories, trans fats, and possibly hazardous chemicals like acrylamide. Some potato chip manufacturers are making value-added products that are healthier than conventional potato chips. Among these are foods that are fortified with healthy ingredients and have lower levels of fat, cholesterol, and calories. For instance, under its Yellow Diamond brand, Prataap Snacks Ltd sells Omega-fortified potato chips. Furthermore, the Uglies Kettle Chips product line expanded last year to include upcycled sweet potato chips marketed as Uglies Sweets. The sweet potatoes used to make the chips are lightly salted and kettle fried in small batches. As opposed to regular chips, these chips are a good source of vitamin A, are gluten-free, kosher certified, nut free, and have non-GMO ingredients, according to the manufacturer.Story continuesMajor Players in the Potato Chip MarketSeveral small and major manufacturers compete on price and quality, creating a highly fragmented market for potato chips worldwide.

Even though oil price has declined (down 5.7% in the January-March period) due to recession fears, it remains high. Since fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player, an uptick in fuel costs is not a welcome development. Operating expenses are on the way up, given the rise in fuel cost.Partly due to these headwinds, the industry has declined 3.9% over the past six months, underperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 4% appreciation and 0.7% decline of the broader Zacks Transportation sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite the challenges surrounding the industry,some railroad companies like Union Pacific Corporation UNP and Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC have consistently announced dividend hikes, thus highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, they offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have superior fundamentals like a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%.

294,282bd721-8adf-33a9-ab50-e26b1e583c9d,CSCO,2023-05-11,Cisco Systems (CSCO) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-csco-earnings-expected-140002725.html,1683727202,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Cisco Systems (CSCO) reports results for the quarter ended April 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 17, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis seller of routers, switches, software and services is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.97 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.5%.Revenues are expected to be $14.39 billion, up 12.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.11% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cisco?For Cisco, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.59%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Cisco will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cisco would post earnings of $0.86 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.88, delivering a surprise of +2.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cisco appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

That year, Cisco transformed its longstanding advocacy for diversity, equity, and inclusion into a global, enterprise-wide commitment to bolder action and greater impact focused on a commitment to the African American/Black community.At the director and executive levels, our talent acquisition strategy gives us a competitive advantage to attracting top diverse talent. We look at areas of emerging business growth and approach recruiting differently by identifying what innovative leadership looks like from a talent perspective. We are creating a recruiting culture that recognizes strong talent and expertise, and we engage talent proactively.To increase full spectrum diversity in our hiring framework-as well as on our board of directors-we cultivate talent pools, expand our executive prospect community, and generate diverse active talent benches. Specifically, we have focused our efforts on:Leveraging diverse candidate slates and developing a pipeline of diverse talent to increase all facets of diversity throughout the hiring and promotion processCultivating a company culture of sponsorship across dimensions of differenceIncreasing opportunities for Cisco executives and senior leaders to get proximate to diverse talentProviding developmental offerings that support the growth of women and underrepresented minority executivesOur efforts are working. We continue to exceed our African American/Black (AA/B) hiring aspirations year over year. Our goal when we set out in 2020 was to increase AA/B talent 25% by fiscal year 2023. I am proud to say that we have increased AA/B talent at Cisco 70% in non-executive roles, 96% in director-level positions, and 182% among vice presidents and above. We also welcomed John D. Harris II and Marianna Tessel to our board of directors.Story continuesTop talent wants to work for companies that understand diversity gives them a competitive edge. Recently, Cisco was named the #1 Best Company to Work For in the U.S. by Fortune and Great Place to Work for the third year in a row. With this extraordinary recognition, our U.S. workplaces join Cisco teams in 12 countries around the world that are also currently ranked #1, including Spain and Portugal.The success of our hiring framework is supported by Cisco's purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All, as well as by the differentiated experience we offer top diverse leadership talent:Scale of Business: Cisco provides clear upward mobility opportunitiesMarket Presence: Cisco is the premier technology brand in the world, reimagining applications, securing the enterprise, transforming infrastructure, and powering hybrid work for a global and inclusive futureGeographic Flexibility: The ability for talent to remain in their current location has proven to be one of Cisco's most significant competitive advantages in attracting and retaining talentCisco Executive Talent Magnets: Our executive leaders are thought leaders within the industry and Cisco ambassadorsEvidence of Commitment to Changing Business: Cisco's efforts to drive the most trusted customer experience in the industry through our innovation, choice, and extraordinary people greatly reassures executive candidates that Cisco is an employer of the futureWhen I talk to leaders who are looking for upward mobility in their career and the best position to use their subject matter expertise, our conversations naturally progress to what's most important to them, job motivations, and interests. I've had leaders tell me, ""You should be my life coach!""""To know that I've helped someone consider what they are excited about in their career, in life, and how their expertise can make immense change in the industry and impact the world, is something special.""This is one of the best compliments I receive, and it validates to me that I'm doing what I love for purpose. To know that I've helped someone consider what they are excited about in their career, in life, and how their expertise can make immense change in the industry and impact the world, is something special.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/753969/Taking-an-Innovative-Approach-to-Recruiting-and-Retaining-Black-Leadership-Talent]"
