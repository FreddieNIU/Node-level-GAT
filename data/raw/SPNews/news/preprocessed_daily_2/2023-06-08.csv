While it’s marginally reassuring that 84% of Americans in the survey consider insurance fraud a crime, the 16% that do not consider it a crime potentially represent more than 53 million Americans,” said Matthew Smith, executive director of the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud. “There is a need for consumer education on the harm insurance fraud crimes have on our economy and on every American citizen and family.”The study found that 87-96% of older respondents consider insurance fraud a crime, while only 75% of those under age 45 consider it a crime, with the percentage skewing downward by age to only 64% for the youngest group.Other findings include:More than 36% of all Americans believe it’s acceptable to submit an inflated auto damage claimOver 30% of 25-34-year-olds “definitely would” submit a fraudulent property damage claim27% of those 18-24 would commit workers’ compensation fraud, compared to less than 10% of those 45 and olderOver a quarter of those 18-34 are “motivated” to commit insurance fraud compared to less than 7% of those over 45“The results prove the continued need for insurers to be hypervigilant about the impact of fraud on their book of business,” said Maroun Mourad, president of Verisk Claims Solutions. “The fact that younger generations are more tolerant and motivated to commit claims fraud indicates that this problem is not going away and is likely to persist in the future. Carriers would be wise to set up a strong perimeter defense to ensure they are adequately and accurately detecting potential fraud throughout the policy life cycle.”Story continuesThe study, conducted by Dynata, collected more than 1,500 responses from a group of insurance-purchasing consumers matching the demographic standards identified in the 2020 U.S. Census.

Shares have added about 17.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Western Digital due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Western Digital Q3 Earnings Beat, Revenues Fall Y/YWestern Digital reported third-quarter fiscal 2023 non-GAAP loss of $1.37 per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.55. The company had reported earnings of $1.65 in the prior-year quarter.The performance was affected by challenging macro environment and underutilization charges which weighed on the margins.Revenues of $2.803 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4%. However, the top line decreased 36% year over year owing to weak performance across all segments. On a sequential basis, revenues declined 10%Quarter in DetailBeginning first-quarter fiscal 2022, Western Digital started reporting revenues under three refined end markets — Cloud (includes products for public or private cloud), Client (includes products sold directly to OEMs or through distribution) and Consumer (includes retail and other end-user products).Revenues from the Cloud end market (43% of total revenues) fell 32% year over year to $1.205 billion owing to lower flash pricing, and lower shipments of both hard drive and flash products. On a sequential basis, cloud revenues were down 2%.Revenues from the Client end market (35% of total revenues) were down 44% year over year to $975 billion. The downtick was caused by lower flash pricing on a year-over-year basis, coupled with reduced client SSD and hard drive shipments for PC applications. Client revenues declined 10% sequentially.Revenues from the Consumer end market (22% of total revenues) were down 29% year over year to $623 million. Revenues decreased 22% on a sequential basis. Sequential performance was hurt by seasonal decline in demand for both retail hard drives and flash products.Story continuesConsidering revenues by product group, Flash revenues (46.6% of total revenues) declined 42% from the year-ago quarter’s figure to $1.307 billion. Sequentially, flash revenues fell 21%. HDD revenues (53.4% of total revenues) decreased 30% year over year to $1.496 billion. Revenues were up 3% quarter over quarter.Key MetricsThe company shipped 12.6 million HDDs at an average selling price (ASP) of $109. The reported shipments declined 36.4% from the prior-year quarter’s levels.On a quarter-over-quarter basis, HDD Exabytes sales were up 15%. Flash exabytes sales were down 14%. Total exabytes sales (excluding non-memory products) were up 9% sequentially. ASP/Gigabytes (excluding licensing, royalties, and non-memory products) were down 10% sequentially.MarginsNon-GAAP gross margin was 10.6% compared with 31.7% reported in the year-ago quarter. The gross margin performance was mainly impacted by $275 million of charges incurred for manufacturing underutilization and inventory write downs among other expenses. HDD gross margin contracted 340 bps year over year to 24.3%. Flash gross margin was a negative 5% against 36% reported in the prior-year quarter.Non-GAAP operating expenses moved down 19% from the year-ago quarter’s level to $602 million. Non-GAAP operating loss totaled $304 million against the non-GAAP operating income of $650 million in the prior-year quarter.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash FlowAs of Mar 31, cash and cash equivalents were $2.22 billion compared with $1.871 billion reported as of Dec 30, 2022.The long-term debt (including current portion) was $7.073 billion as of Mar 31. Western Digital used $381 million in cash from operations against $398 million of cash generated from operations in the previous-year quarter.Free cash outflow amounted to $527 million against the free cash flow $148 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Q4 GuidanceFor fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects non-GAAP revenues in the range of $2.4-$2.6 billion. Management projects non-GAAP loss per share to be between $1.90 and $2.20.WDC expects non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 3-5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be between $580 million and $600 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -44.95% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Western Digital has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Western Digital has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerWestern Digital is part of the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry. Over the past month, Teradata (TDC), a stock from the same industry, has gained 10.3%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended March 2023 more than a month ago.Teradata reported revenues of $476 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4%.

4,c7f87209-6491-3865-ad87-02a995f04216,UNM,2023-06-08,Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Unum Group,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-113800997.html,1686137880,STORY,"['UNM', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate Release Chicago, IL – June 7, 2023 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Unum Group UNM.The One Trigger That Consistently Predicts Explosive GainsThe price action in the stock market this year has illustrated how important it is to remain disciplined and follow a rule-based strategy. As nearly every Wall Street analyst was calling for lower stock prices in 2023 (along with an impending recession), it paid to ignore the noise and listen to what the market and individual stocks were telling us.A strategy that is mainly mechanical can free investors from emotional decision-making. Emotions can prevent investors from making sound decisions and are one of our biggest threats to achieving a considerable rate of return on our investments.Rule-based strategies remove the reliance of making decisions based on predictions or guesswork. Investing using a clear set of rules allows investors to follow a disciplined approach. And here at Zacks, we provide our subscribers with a rule-based strategy that has consistently outperformed the market year after year.How to Predict Explosive GainsAt the heart of this strategy is the Zacks Rank, which analyzes earnings estimate revisions. These earnings revisions have been shown to be the most powerful force impacting stock prices. Only the top 20% of all stocks that are experiencing the most substantial revisions are ranked as either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Stocks with rising estimates have significantly outperformed the S&amp;P 500. In fact, based on a recent 34-year study, a portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks beat the market with an average annual return of over 25% per year – more than double that of the S&amp;P's 11.1%.That's why it is so crucial to keep an eye on which stocks are ranked favorably by the Zacks Rank system. Let's take a look at a current example in today's investment climate.Story continuesA Zacks 'Strong Buy' and Consistent Outperformer Unum Group provides financial protection benefits solutions primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland. UNM provides group long-term and short-term disability, group life, and accidental death and dismemberment products. The company also offers cancer and critical illness, dental and vision, group pension, and voluntary life insurance products.UNM is ranked as the leading disability income writer and second-largest writer of voluntary business in the United States. The company sells its products through field sales personnel, independent brokers, consultants, and independent contractor agencies.UNM is part of the Zacks Insurance – Accident and Health industry, which is currently ranked in the top 8% out of approximately 250 industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform over the next 3 to 6 months.Quantitative research studies have shown that approximately half of a stock's future price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. By focusing on the top stocks within leading industry groups, we can dramatically improve our odds of success.A History of Earnings Beats and Improving ForecastsUNM has built up an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters. Last month, the company reported first-quarter earnings of $1.87/share, a 13.33% surprise over the $1.65 consensus estimate. UNM has delivered a +18.61% average earnings surprise over the last four quarters.In a sign of strength, analysts covering the insurance company have increased their full-year EPS estimates by +11.23% in the past 60 days. The 2023 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $7.43/share, reflecting potential growth of 19.7% relative to last year. It's exactly the type of trend we want to look for when narrowing down our list of potential stocks.What the Zacks Model Unveils The Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) seeks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that this recent information can serve as a more accurate predictor of the future, which can give investors a leg up during earnings season.The technique has proven to be quite useful in finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better with a positive Earnings ESP, stocks delivered a positive surprise 70% of the time according to our 10-year backtest.UNM is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and boasts a +1.17% Earnings ESP. Another beat may be in the cards when the company reports its Q2 results.Disclosure: UNM is a holding in the Zacks Income Investor portfolio.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

5,056a5a3e-dbce-3087-870d-3330c637497e,STT,2023-06-08,State Street Corporation Announces Transition Information for Outstanding U.S. Dollar LIBOR-Linked Instruments,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-corporation-announces-transition-203000975.html,1686169800,STORY,"['STT', 'STT-PD', 'STT-PG']","[BOSTON, June 07, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--State Street Corporation (NYSE: STT) today announced information regarding the transition of its presently outstanding U.S. Dollar LIBOR-linked instruments, consisting of several floating or fixed-to-floating rate debt securities and series of preferred stock represented by depositary shares (collectively, the ""USD LIBOR Securities""), to other rate mechanisms, based upon a broader industry transition away from U.S. dollar LIBOR (""USD LIBOR""). In March 2021, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after June 30, 2023, the USD LIBOR for a three-month tenor (the ""Three-Month USD LIBOR"") would cease publication or no longer be representative. In connection with the cessation of representative USD LIBOR, in March 2022, the U.S. Congress enacted the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the ""LIBOR Act""), and in December 2022 the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the ""Federal Reserve"") issued a final rule thereunder (the ""LIBOR Rule"").State Street has issued and outstanding USD LIBOR Securities for which Three-Month USD LIBOR currently serves as the benchmark rate used in connection with the calculation or determination of applicable interest, dividend or distribution payments. These securities, each of which is governed by either New York or Massachusetts law, are listed in the Annexes to this press release.Effective the first London banking date after June 30, 2023 (the ""LIBOR Replacement Date""), the reference rate for calculations or determinations of applicable interest, dividend or distribution payments for each of the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 1 or Annex 2 to this press release will be the CME Term SOFR Reference Rate published for the three-month tenor, as administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration, Ltd. (or any successor administrator thereof) (the ""Three-Month CME Term SOFR""), plus a tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161%. The replacement of USD LIBOR as the benchmark rate for each of the USD LIBOR Securities will be effective for determinations under the terms of the USD LIBOR Securities that are made on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date, but will not affect any determinations made prior to the LIBOR Replacement Date.Story continuesNon-Workable Contractual FallbacksThe USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 1 to this press release contain fallback provisions that provide for (1) a poll or inquiries for quotes or information related to USD LIBOR or (2) benchmark replacements based on USD LIBOR values (such as the most recently available USD LIBOR rate or USD LIBOR rate as determined by the calculation agent using discretion). Under the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR Rule, on the LIBOR Replacement Date, by operation of law (a) these fallback provisions will be disregarded and deemed null and void and without any force or effect, and (b) Three-Month USD LIBOR will be replaced as the benchmark rate by Three-Month CME Term SOFR, plus a tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161%.Determining Person DiscretionThe USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 2 to this press release contain fallback provisions authorizing State Street to identify as the benchmark replacement rate for Three-Month USD LIBOR the alternative reference rate selected by a central bank, reserve bank, monetary authority or any similar institution (including any committee or working group thereof) that is consistent with market practice regarding a substitute for USD LIBOR. As such, under the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR Rule, State Street Corporation is the person with the authority under the terms of these USD LIBOR Securities to determine a benchmark replacement for USD LIBOR (referred to in the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR Rule as the ""determining person""). For each of these USD LIBOR Securities, State Street Corporation, as the determining person, has selected Three-Month CME Term SOFR, plus a tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161%, as the benchmark replacement for Three-Month USD LIBOR determinations that are made on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date.Contractual Fixed RateEach series of State Street’s Preferred Stock listed in Annex 3 to this press release is governed by the terms of a certificate of designation (each, a ""Certificate"") and will not transition to Three-month CME Term SOFR by operation of law or otherwise. The Certificate for each such series specifies a fixed dividend rate (the ""Dividend Rate"") for a dividend period beginning on a specified date (the ""Commencement Date""), in each case as shown for each series in Annex 3 to this press release, if Three-Month USD LIBOR cannot otherwise be determined as provided in the applicable Certificate. Given that the Commencement Date for each such series follows the LIBOR Replacement Date, the Dividend Rate for each series after the applicable Commencement Date will be the applicable fixed rate specified in Annex 3 to this press release.Conforming ChangesFor the USD LIBOR Securities for which the Federal Reserve-selected benchmark replacement becomes the benchmark replacement for USD LIBOR (1) by operation of law under the LIBOR Act (the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 1 to this press release) or (2) because State Street as the determining person made such selection (the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 2 to this press release), the LIBOR Rule provides that certain benchmark replacement conforming changes will become an integral part of such securities by operation of law. See Annex 4 to this press release for a description of such conforming changes. In addition, a person responsible for calculating or determining any valuation, payment or other measurement based on a benchmark (a ""calculating person"") has the authority under the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR Rule to make certain additional benchmark replacement conforming changes (in addition to those specified in the LIBOR Rule) under securities such as the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 1 and Annex 2 to this press release without any requirement to obtain consent from any other person.Any such additional changes that the applicable calculating person makes with respect to such USD LIBOR Securities will become an integral part of the applicable securities by operation of law and be the subject of a separate announcement.This press release applies only to the USD LIBOR Securities listed in the Annexes to this press release and does not relate to any other securities or other instruments. In advance of the LIBOR Replacement Date, further notices relating to CME Term SOFR as the benchmark replacement rate for USD LIBOR for the USD LIBOR Securities held through The Depository Trust Company (""DTC"") will be made pursuant to the DTC LIBOR Replacement Index Communication Tool.About State Street CorporationState Street Corporation (NYSE: STT) is one of the world's leading providers of financial services to institutional investors including investment servicing, investment management and investment research and trading.

(TMO) is gaining investors’ confidence, backed by the performance of the company’s end markets. Through the proven growth strategy powered by the PPI (Practical Process Improvement) Business System, Thermo Fisher continued to deliver differentiated performance in the first quarter.Thermo Fisher’s clinical research business, PPD, also had a very strong start to the year, as it continues to benefit from revenue synergies. However, weak solvency and a competitive landscape are worrisome.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 6.3% against the 2.6% rise of the industry and a 6% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical and laboratory equipment provider has a market capitalization of $200.03 billion. TMO has an earnings yield of 4.57% compared to the industry’s -7%. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 5.99%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesStrong End Markets:  Within the pharma and biotech end market, Thermo Fisher delivered growth in the mid-single digits in the first quarter. The company delivered a very strong performance in pharma services, clinical research and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn academics and government, TMO witnessed growth across a range of its businesses, including biosciences, electron microscopy, chromatography and mass spectrometry, and the restructured safety market channel. Within industrial and applied, Thermo Fisher grew in the high single digits during the quarter, led by strong growth in all of its analytical instrument businesses, including electron microscopy, chromatography and mass spectrometry.Growth Strategy Looks Promising:  Starting with the first pillar, innovation, the company launched many high-impact new products across businesses in the first quarter. These include the Thermo Scientific iCAP RQ Plus ICP-MS Analyzer, the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio Absolute Q AutoRun dPCR Suite and the Invitrogen DynaGreen.Story continuesFor the second pillar, TMO continues to strengthen its capabilities to serve emerging markets by opening a new Gibco cell culture rapid prototyping facility at the existing site in Suzhou, China. This facility will help regional customers accelerate the transition of their cell culture media production into current good manufacturing practices.For the third pillar, Thermo Fisher achieved an exciting milestone in its strategic partnership with the University of California, San Francisco. In the first quarter, TMO announced the opening of a new cell therapy cGMP Manufacturing and Collaboration Center, to accelerate the development of breakthrough therapies for glioblastoma, multiple myeloma and other cancers.PPD Acquisition Seems Strategic: In December 2021, Thermo Fisher completed its colossal $17.4-billion acquisition of PPD, Inc., a renowned global contract research organization providing clinical research services to the biopharma and biotech industry. The acquisition is anticipated to expand Thermo Fishers’ global reach in the attractive, high-growth clinical research services industry.On the first-quarter earnings update, the company noted that PPD business growth continued to be in the mid-teens. Thermo Fisher had a strong backlog and a good level of authorization,  which will continue to benefit the company from revenue synergies.DownsidesTough Competitive Pressure: For its diversified portfolio, Thermo Fisher faces different types of competitors, including a broad range of manufacturers and third-party distributors. The competitive landscape is quite tough with changing technology and customer demands that require continuous research and development.Weak Solvency: At the quarter-end, TMO had approximately $35.3 billion of total debt, much higher than the corresponding cash and cash equivalent level of $3.48 billion. The times interest earned for the company stands at 8.5%, suggesting a sequential decline from 11.8% at the end of the fourth quarter.Estimate TrendThermo Fisher has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has moved from $23.70 to $23.69 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $45.31 billion.

8,5a468e47-2169-3271-a73a-8b90fa668635,USB,2023-06-08,U.S. Bancorp (USB) Could Be a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bancorp-usb-could-great-154505215.html,1686152705,STORY,['USB'],"[All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.U.S. Bancorp in FocusBased in Minneapolis, U.S. Bancorp (USB) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -25.18%. Currently paying a dividend of $0.48 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 5.88%. In comparison, the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield is 4.4%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.73%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.92 is up 2.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, U.S. Bancorp has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.47%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. U.S. Bancorp's current payout ratio is 41%. This means it paid out 41% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, USB expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.59 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 3.15%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, USB is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""Our Baja 1000 race team chose to compete with a purpose: raise money to support the charity's mission to improve the health and well-being of children.""As part of that mission, RMHC of Greater Houston/Galveston helps fund the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile, a mobile medical unit that visits underserved communities to provide free immunizations and healthcare for children. The Ronald McDonald Care Mobile doctors and nurses can also intervene on serious healthcare issues and refer the children for more specialized care.The program's positive impact motivates the Winkels and their 30-member Baja 1000 race team, made up of family and friends.""Our team's motto was, ‘We're going off-road to keep the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile on the road,'"" Winkel said.Winkel and her teammates have raised more than $50,000 since 2021.""We plan to compete in the Baja 1000 again this November to continue fundraising and reach our $100,000 goal,"" she said.Story continuesFor their work with the inspiring race team, Alma and David Winkel were recognized this month with the 2023 Heroes of the Hearts Award by RMHC of Greater Houston/Galveston. This recognition honors community members who have gone above and beyond to support the chapter's mission.Not only does Winkel say she loves racing to support RMHC of Greater Houston/Galveston, she also loves being part of the ""McFamily"" at her job. As a commercial banker, Winkel has served McDonald's owner/operators across the western United States for 18 years, most recently as part of the U.S. Bank McDonald's Franchise Group. U.S. Bank built this team in 2009 to support banking and working capital needs for franchisees.""Whether an owner/operator wants to start or expand a franchise, or a long-time owner/operator wants to transfer ownership to the next generation, U.S. Bank can help,"" she said.U.S. Bank is a long-time supporter of Ronald McDonald House Charities.

CF is expected to benefit from healthy nitrogen fertilizer demand in major markets and lower natural gas costs amid headwinds from lower nitrogen prices.The company’s shares are down 25.7% over a year compared with the 37.4% decline of its industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s find out why this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining at the moment.Higher Nitrogen Demand Bodes WellCF Industries is well-placed to gain from rising global demand for nitrogen fertilizers, driven by significant agricultural demand. Higher crop commodity prices are contributing to healthy demand globally. Industrial demand has also recovered from the pandemic-related disruptions. High levels of corn planted acres in the United States and favorable farm economics are likely to drive the demand for nitrogen in North America. Increased planted corn acres, higher crop prices and healthy farm economics are expected to drive urea demand in Brazil. The company also expects India to be one of the world’s biggest urea importers this year with frequent urea tenders in the second half.The company is also expected to benefit from lower natural gas prices. CF Industries witnessed higher year-over-year costs in 2022, leading to a rise in its cost of sales. Natural gas costs also increased to $6.62 per MMBtu in the first quarter of 2023 from $6.48 per MMBtu in the year-ago quarter. However, the company expects a significant decline in natural gas costs in the second quarter. Lower natural gas costs are expected to lead to a decline in the company's cost of sales.CF Industries also remains committed to boosting shareholders’ value by leveraging strong cash flows. It generated operating cash flows of roughly $3.9 billion and a free cash flow of around $2.8 billion in 2022. The company also returned $1.65 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2022. It also bought back more than 1 million shares for $75 million in the first quarter of 2023. The company’s board has authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program, which will commence upon completion of the existing share repurchase program and run through the end of 2025.Story continuesLower Nitrogen Prices a ConcernCF Industries faces headwinds from lower nitrogen prices. Global nitrogen prices have declined since the beginning of 2023. Higher global supply availability driven by higher global operating rates due to lower global energy costs has resulted in a decline in prices. Lower average selling prices weighed on CF's top line in the first quarter. The weak pricing environment is expected to continue in the second quarter. Lower pricing is expected to hurt the company’s sales and margins. CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

12,27fed349-7e4b-3166-9f9e-3d52b2687746,CTAS,2023-06-08,Here's Why We Think Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) Might Deserve Your Attention Today,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-think-cintas-nasdaq-130131253.html,1686142891,STORY,['CTAS'],"[For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. View our latest analysis for Cintas Cintas' Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Cintas grew its EPS by 12% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It's noted that Cintas' revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. EBIT margins for Cintas remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 13% to US$8.6b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Cintas' forecast profits?Are Cintas Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Cintas has a market capitalisation of US$49b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$7.3b. Coming in at 15% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Looking very optimistic for investors.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Cintas, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m.The Cintas CEO received US$7.8m in compensation for the year ending May 2022. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Should You Add Cintas To Your Watchlist?One positive for Cintas is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for Cintas, but the pleasant picture gets better than that. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for Cintas that you need to be mindful of.Although Cintas certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, then this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

It was 50 large cap stocks that were considered “must own” by professional investors. They were growth stocks and it was believed that you should own them no matter what the price.On average, at the peak of the bull market, many traded with a P/E over 50. But valuation didn’t matter because each company had a strong growth story.These weren’t companies that didn’t have earnings. Some were dominant in their industries, like IBM and General Electric, and were innovating.As long as there was growth, what could go wrong?2 Original Nifty Fifty StocksThere is no actual list of which companies were in the Nifty Fifty. But there are a bunch of companies that most agree were considered on it. Many of those companies are still in business today.1.      McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)McDonald’s went IPO on Apr 21, 1965. In the early stages of its growth, it was a popular growth stock in the 1960s and 70s and was considered a part of the Nifty Fifty. But is it still a growth stock today?McDonald’s earnings are expected to rise 9.3% in 2023 while sales are forecast to grow 7.7%. Not too shabby for a mature global company.Shares of McDonald’s recently traded at new all-time highs. They are up 76.2% over the last 5 years compared to the S&amp;P 500’s gain of 53.8%. But shares aren’t cheap. McDonald’s is trading with a forward P/E of 26.Story continuesShould investors still ignore valuation with McDonald’s and buy at any price?2.      Walmart Inc. (WMT)Walmart was also a young company in the 1960s and 70s. It went public on Oct 1, 1970.Walmart earnings are expected to fall 1.4% in fiscal 2024, as the economy slows this year. Sales are forecast to rise 4.2%, however.Walmart is a mature company in 2023. Growth has slowed. But the shares are not cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 24.2.Should Walmart be on your short list?3 New Nifty Fifty StocksWhat companies would be on a new Nifty Fifty? These would be growth stocks that investors considered to be “must own” and which valuation didn’t matter.There’s no screen to run to find these stocks. But here are 3 that would surely be in the running for the new list.1.      Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG)Is Chipotle the McDonald’s of the new Nifty Fifty? This restaurant chain continues to expand. Earnings are expected to rise 34% in 2023 with sales up 14%.No, Chipotle isn’t cheap. It has a forward P/E of 47.3.Shares of Chipotle are up 355% over the last 5 years and are hitting new highs.Would you pay any price in order to own Chipotle?2.      e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (ELF)e.l.f. Beauty, the cosmetics and skin care company, seemingly hits new all-time highs virtually every day. Shares are up 93.5% this year. Over the last 5 years, shares of e.l.f. Beauty have gained 453%, outpacing the S&amp;P 500, which is up just 53.8% during that same time.But it’s not cheap. e.l.f Beauty now trades with a forward P/E of 59. Earnings are expected to be up in fiscal 2024, rising 7.2% while sales are expected to surge 25%.Are you buying e.l.f. Beauty even at these valuations?3.      Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW)Palo Alto Networks has it all. Earnings are expected to rise 67.9% in fiscal 2023. Sales are forecast to rise 25.3% this year as well.Palo Alto Networks is even a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as analysts have been raising earnings estimates.But it’s not cheap.

(NYSE:XYL),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forecasts-heres-analysts-think-future-103021450.html,1686220221,STORY,['XYL'],"[Shareholders in Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) may be thrilled to learn that the analysts have just delivered a major upgrade to their near-term forecasts. The revenue forecast for this year has experienced a facelift, with the analysts now much more optimistic on its sales pipeline. The stock price has risen 6.9% to US$107 over the past week, suggesting investors are becoming more optimistic. It will be interesting to see if this latest upgrade is enough to kickstart further buying interest in the stock.Following the upgrade, the latest consensus from Xylem's four analysts is for revenues of US$7.0b in 2023, which would reflect a huge 23% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Before the latest update, the analysts were foreseeing US$6.0b of revenue in 2023. It looks like there's been a clear increase in optimism around Xylem, given the nice gain to revenue forecasts. Check out our latest analysis for Xylem earnings-and-revenue-growthLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's clear from the latest estimates that Xylem's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 32% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2023 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 1.4% p.a. over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 4.2% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Xylem is expected to grow much faster than its industry.The Bottom LineThe highlight for us was that analysts increased their revenue forecasts for Xylem this year. They're also forecasting more rapid revenue growth than the wider market. Seeing the dramatic upgrade to this year's forecasts, it might be time to take another look at Xylem.Story continuesUnanswered questions?

Sales and trading revenues (excluding net DVA) were up 9% from the prior-year quarter. Fixed-income trading fees rose 29%, while equity trading income decreased 19%.However, total IB fees tanked 24.1%, reflecting the weak industry-wide performance of the underwriting business. Advisory fees plunged 28.7%.Over the past six months, shares of BAC have declined 19.5% compared with the industry’s fall of 11.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, Bank of America carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesOur TakeThe current challenging economic environment has led to a persistent slowdown in the IB business. Factors such as geopolitical tensions, inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a global recession have acted as headwinds for mergers and acquisitions.Thus, deal volume and total deal value numbers have crashed. For the same reasons, IPOs, follow-up equity issuances and bond issuances have dried up.Thus, similar to BofA, Morgan Stanley’s MS trading and IB outlook looks bleak for the near term.Per Morgan Stanley’s co-president, Andy Saperstein, the firm expects a year-over-year decline in its trading and IB revenues in the second quarter of 2023.Saperstein believes that because of a more challenging economic environment, Morgan Stanley’s sales and trading “results will be notably down year over year versus a strong second quarter last year,” while “investment banking is also very challenged.""Because of this challenging economic environment, Morgan Stanley has been compelled to reconsider its headcount. MS has been considering cutting around 7% of jobs in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan). This is part of the broader 3,000 IB job cuts that the company announced earlier.Similarly, in February, it was reported that Bank of America was planning to cut jobs in its investment bank. The cuts are expected to have affected less than 200 bankers globally.Like MS and BAC, Citigroup C has been taking steps in its IB and wealth management divisions.This March, Citigroup initiated a round of job cuts, slashing hundreds of jobs across the firm, which accounted for less than 1% of its total workforce. According to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified, the company’s IB division, its operations and technology organization, and the U.S. mortgage-underwriting division were among those affected.In its IB division, Citigroup was struggling because of the industry-wide slowdown in deal-making. In its mortgage division, the company was grappling with reduced mortgage demand because of rising prices and a rapid increase in mortgage rates.(We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake.

(NYSE: FE), is investing approximately $34 million in 2023 to trim trees along more than 3,400 miles of power lines across its 13-county central and northern New Jersey service area. This work will help prevent or minimize the impact of tree-related damages during severe weather, as fallen trees and branches contacting lines and electrical equipment remain a leading cause of power outages.JCP&amp;L Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)Since Jan. 1, JCP&amp;L contractors have successfully completed trimming along more than 760 miles of lines, with nearly 2,700 miles of additional trimming expected to be completed by the end of the year.""Tree trimming is a year-round effort by our crews and contractors and just one of the proactive steps we take to minimize the impact of power outages and ensure the safe, reliable delivery of electricity,"" said James Fakult, president of FirstEnergy's New Jersey operations. ""Doing this work in a responsible way is also a priority, as our stewardship of the environment and our communities is a core value for JCP&amp;L.""Vegetation near power lines is inspected to ensure trees are pruned in a manner that helps preserve the health of trees while maintaining proper clearances around electrical equipment. All trimming work is conducted by certified forestry contractors under the company's direction and done in compliance with regulatory requirements.Crews are also continuing a multi-year effort to identify and remove deteriorated ash trees that have been affected by the Emerald Ash Borer. Last year, nearly 40% of tree-related power outages in JCP&amp;L's service territory were caused by ash trees. Since the initiative to mitigate the dangers posed by these trees began in 2017, nearly 20,000 dead or diseased trees have been removed.Story continuesJCP&amp;L will trim trees in the following counties and municipalities over the next two months:Burlington – Fort DixEssex – Short Hills (Millburn)Hunterdon – Alexandria, Bethlehem, Bloomsbury, Califon, Delaware, East Amwell, Flemington, Holland, Lebanon, Milford, Raritan, Tewksbury, Union and West AmwellMercer – Hightstown, Hopewell and West WindsorMiddlesex – Cranbury, East Brunswick, Helmetta, Jamesburg, Monroe, Old Bridge and SpotswoodMonmouth – Aberdeen, Colts Neck, Englishtown, Farmingdale, Freehold, Freehold Borough, Holmdel, Howell, Manalapan, Manasquan, Marlboro, Middletown, Millstone, Sea Girt, Spring Lake, Spring Lake Heights, Tinton Falls, Upper Freehold and WallMorris – Chatham, Chester, Chester Borough, Denville, Morris Plains, Morristown, Mount Tabor (Parsippany-Troy Hills), Mount Olive, Parsippany-Troy Hills, Randolph, Roxbury and WashingtonMercer –Bayville (Berkeley), Forked River (Lacey), Jackson, Lanoka Harbor (Lacey), Manchester, Plumsted, South Toms River and Toms RiverSomerset – Bedminster and WarrenSussex – Franklin, Glenwood (Vernon), Hamburg, Lafayette, McAfee (Vernon), Newton, Sparta, Sussex and VernonUnion – Berkeley Heights, Murray Hill (Berkeley Heights-New Providence), New Providence and SummitWarren – Alpha Borough, Changewater (Washington), Greenwich, Hackettstown, Oxford, Pohatcong, Port Murray (Mansfield) and WashingtonJCP&amp;L works with municipalities to proactively inform them of vegetation management schedules. In addition, customers living in areas along company rights-of-way are notified prior to work being performed. To help further decrease tree-related outages, JCP&amp;L's foresters are also working to educate residents who live near company equipment about the importance of properly maintaining trees on their own property.In a rate review filed with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities in March, JCP&amp;L proposed an approximately $11 million annual increase in vegetation management and tree trimming activities. The additional funding would allow for increased trimming of trees threatening power lines outside of company rights-of-way. In 2022, 84% of tree-related outages were caused by trees outside of JCP&amp;L's trimming corridors.JCP&amp;L serves 1.1 million customers in the counties of Burlington, Essex, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex, Union and Warren.

46,583d44f0-a9ef-333b-b583-c9fd11cf4441,CRM,2023-06-08,12 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-hot-stocks-buy-according-121521749.html,1686140121,STORY,"['META', 'CRM', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'NOW', 'AAPL', 'MU', 'TSM', 'CRWD', 'TSLA']","[In this article we present the list of 12 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) are some of the hottest stocks on the market this year, which is likely of little surprise to their bullish hedge fund shareholders, which own each of them in significant quantities.Stocks are off to a strong start in 2023 as they look to rebound from an underwhelming 2021 and an even poorer 2022. The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust has gained 11.9% this year on the heels of 19.5% losses in 2022, while the NYSE is up a more modest 1.3% after 11.5% losses last year. The biggest winners though have been tech stocks, as the Nasdaq has soared by 26.9% year-to-date following a 33.1% decline in 2022.That’s left no shortage of hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds, with several of their top 10 most popular stocks all delivering big returns this year, while the majority of stocks on this last, all of which have gained at least 30% in 2023, rank among their 30 most popular stocks. Unsurprisingly, tech stocks occupy most of the spots on this list, with AI being a key theme that is driving many of their results to new heights or expanding their capabilities in exciting ways.To determine which hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds, you first need to know how to find out what hedge funds are buying. Insider Monkey specializes in exactly that, publishing dozens of articles quarterly on the latest hedge fund activity according to their most recent 13F filings with the SEC, in which hedge funds with more than $500 million in assets under management must disclose their holdings.Insider Monkey also compiles the quarterly ownership data from a select group of 900+ top performing funds to create industry and other theme-specific lists of what stocks hedge funds are buying now, so investors can get a quick snapshot into how some of the brightest minds in the investment world feel about the prospects of companies compared to their rivals in various industries and sectors.Story continuesCritics sometimes point to the fact that any list of the hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds is already outdated by the time their holdings data becomes available, given that most hedge funds don’t disclose their holdings until the 13F filing deadline approximately six weeks after the date on which they’re reporting their holdings. However, given their general focus on long-term investing, this criticism is relatively unwarranted and makes them the ideal investors to piggyback for anyone who’s looking to build a portfolio of diversified assets with great long-term potential.That’s not to say we don’t see significant swings in hedge fund ownership of certain stocks each quarter, as just a single event or earnings report can dramatically alter the long-term outlook for companies. In other cases, some of the hottest stocks to buy according to hedge funds see slight declines in ownership in the following quarter(s) simply because they’ve been doing so well and may have reached a valuation point that has surpassed the fair value estimates that some funds have on those stocks.With all of that in mind, let’s check out 12 hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds, which have enriched their shareholders with at least 30% returns this year.12 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe following list of the hottest stocks to buy according to hedge funds are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment and include only the most popular stocks among hedge funds which have posted at least 30% gains year-to-date. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.12 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds12. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 102 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 32.3% Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) are a few of the hottest stocks buy according to hedge funds, who own large stakes in all of those high-performing stocks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is another hot stock hedge funds love, having hit an all-time high in hedge fund ownership during Q1, topping 100 for the first time. The number of smart money TSM shareholders has more than doubled over the last four years. Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Capital and Stanley Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Capital were among the funds to add TSM to their 13F portfolios during Q1.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the first of several semiconductor stocks to make the list of hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds thanks to its dominant position in the high-performance chip market, where it currently controls close to a 90% share of the global market. As the demand for top-of-the-line chips intensifies in the coming years thanks to the expected robust growth in AI and cloud computing applications, Taiwan Semiconductor appears poised to continue its impressive growth and further grow its already-strong margins.Wedgewood Partners likes Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)’s long-term growth outlook, as relayed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed to performance as revenues grew +27% (in USD) from the year ago quarter. Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”11. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 73 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 34.5% Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shares have rallied this year after a miserable 2022 that saw them lose 46% of their value. While they still have a ways to go to make up all of those losses, their 38.2% gains year-to-date have convinced several hedge funds to go long MU, including Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners, which bought nearly 4.3 million MU shares in Q1.Despite recently being banned in China when it comes to certain critical infrastructure projects and installations, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shares have outperformed even TSM’s this year, gaining 35% year-to-date. According to Bernstein analyst Mark Li, the impact of the China ban should be relatively negligible for Micron in the grand scheme of things, as Micron’s enterprise segment accounts just 20% of overall revenue, with China’s portion of that likely accounting for as little as 2% of overall revenue.Claret Asset Management noted that Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shares had lost nearly half their value through the first nine months of 2022 in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”10. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 289 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 40.2% Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the most popular stock among hedge funds in terms of single-ticker ownership (Alphabet has more hedge fund shareholders combined between its two tickers) and it hasn’t disappointed smart money managers this year, returning 36% year-to-date. Unsurprisingly, The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, managed by Michael Larson, is the largest MSFT shareholder with 39.3 million shares. Its 13F portfolio has 31% exposure to Microsoft.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is taking some intriguing steps to eat into Google’s search dominance, having recently integrated its own search engine Bing into the AI chatbot ChatGPT, a move that was facilitated by Microsoft’s earlier $13 billion investment in the AI platform’s creators, OpenAI. The tech giant is also gaining a strong foothold in the cloud computing space, as Azure is slowing gaining market share on Amazon’s AWS.Alger Spectra Fund discussed the latest AI innovations at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. Microsoft’s CEO expects technology spending as a percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to jump from about 5% now to 10% in 10 years and that Microsoft will continue to capture market share within the technology sector. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office. LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services. Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows Devices, Gaming, and Search). While the company reported decent fiscal second quarter results, their investment in OpenAl’s ChatGPT captured the attention of investors. Contributing to positive performance. Throughout the quarter. Microsoft surprised investors with continual rollouts of new Al capabilities across the company’s portfolio (e.g., Bing, GitHub. Teams, Office 365). Furthermore, the company announced Microsoft 365 Copilot, which leverages GPT-4, a large language model, combined with the Microsoft Graph of data to provide Al virtual assistance. We believe Microsoft’s investment in OpenAl provides a first-mover advantage in the Al transformer model space. Despite challenges in the early days of Al-powered applications, the pace of Al innovation is faster than any other enterprise technology previously observed, in our view.”9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 204 (GOOGL)/155 (GOOG) Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 41.2% Hedge fund ownership of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) peaked at the end of 2021 with nearly 400 long positions in the company’s class A and class C shares being held by hedge funds (some of which owned both classes). That was followed by a 6.9% drop in ownership during the first-half of 2022 and another slight dip in the first quarter of this year.Considering the broad questions facing the long-term viability of Google Search in the age of AI, as outlined in the Microsoft writeup above, it’s perhaps somewhat surprising to see Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares up 41% this year. That said, the effect of ChatGPT/Bing on Google Search’s market share has been negligible thus far. In fact, Google’s market share rose by 20 basis points to 92.8% in April compared to December 2022, when ChatGPT was first unleashed. And while Search undoubtedly remains the company’s bread-and-butter when it comes to ad revenue, it also has a strong cloud division that grew revenue by 28% in Q1, while YouTube remains the world’s dominant streaming platform with more than 2 billion monthly active users.The Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy detailed why Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was one of its strongest Q1 performers in the fund’s Q1 2023 investor letter:“We did have several strong performing stocks this quarter. Our top contributors to return included NVR, Amazon, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft and Booking Holdings, all of which posted double-digit gains. Shares of media and technology giant Alphabet outperformed as the company announced expense discipline while continuing to invest in its core products of Google Search, YouTube and Google Cloud.”8. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 96 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 44.4% Shares of SaaS workflow platform operator ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) have shot up by 38% in 2023 as the company continues to grow its business at an impressive rate. Hedge funds may be getting concerned about the stock’s valuation, as their ownership of NOW has ticked down slightly for three straight quarters, but it nonetheless remains one of the 30 most popular holdings among smart money managers.ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is also turning to AI to bolster the digital transformation suite of services that it offers clients, including recently launching an AI collaboration with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), one of the hottest stocks on the planet in 2023 (look for it in the second half of this article). The company will use Nvidia’s software to train its own proprietary AI algorithms in how to better manage workflows and disrupt bottlenecks. ServiceNow is also well on the path to profitability, which has investors excited about the stock’s near-term and longer-term outlook.The Polen Global Growth Strategy believes ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) can grow free cash flow at a greater than 20% annualized rate over the next three-to-five years, which it outlined in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an $80 billion market cap business based in California. Its purpose is to make the world of work, work better for people. Getting a job done in an enterprise (what the company refers to as “workflow”) usually requires different people in various functions of an organization to work together. Often, they rely on different technology systems and inefficient manual processes to complete each step of the job before moving on to the next.ServiceNow believes the most effective digital transformation initiative utilizes tools that can integrate workflows across siloed systems, departments, processes, and people. The company is solving what is arguably the biggest pain point in the biggest profit pool in the world (enterprises). Consider the explosion in data growth and all the software point solutions emerging constantly. ServiceNow wrangles all this into a fully integrated dashboard on a global scale with global customers in every industry. Nearly 100% of revenues are subscription based with a 99% renewal rate, and the company currently has no direct competition, according to our research. ServiceNow started with IT workflow, and today, ~40% of net new annual contract value is in non-IT workflows. Through constant innovation, the business has continued to expand its total addressable market, and we think it can grow free cash flow (FCF) at a 20%+ annualized rate for the next three to five years. At less than 30x FCF, we thought the valuation was attractive.”7. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 131 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 46.8% Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another prominent tech company that’s rallied in 2023, gaining over 38%. That’s great news for investing icon Warren Buffett, whose 13F portfolio has unprecedented exposure to the mobile tech giant at 46.4% as of March 13. Overall, there was a slight drop in hedge fund ownership of Apple during Q1.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares slumped by 27% in 2022 but have quickly made up those losses this year, having pushed back near their all-time highs. While the iPhone still accounts for over 50% of Apple’s revenue, its higher-margin services segment continues to grow at an accelerated rate, hitting $20.9 billion in revenue during the company’s fiscal Q2 of 2023. That robust services segment also gives Apple an impressively high moat, as it keeps customers insulated within its own ecosystem, which is undoubtedly why Buffett is such a fan of the company.RiverPark Large Growth Fund believes Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is still one of the most innovative and well-positioned mobile tech companies in the world, as it divulged in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were our final top contributor for the quarter. While the company reported a rare quarterly earnings miss, investors had expected slower sales due to macro headwinds. Services continue to be a bright spot for the company with an all-time high of $21 billion in quarterly revenue, a 6% year-over-year increase, and management expects iPhone revenue growth to re-accelerate in 2Q. Operating Cash Flow was $34 billion for the quarter, and the company returned $23 billion to shareholders in the last three months, including $4 billion in dividends and $19 billion in share repurchases.With an installed base of 2 billion active devices and significant growth of the company’s recurring revenue Services segment (now 18% of revenue), we believe that Apple remains one of the most innovative, best-positioned and most profitable companies in the mobile technology industry.”6. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 72 Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 49.2% There was a 25% drop in hedge fund ownership of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) during the final quarter of 2022 as investors worried about weakening demand for the company’s cybersecurity offerings. There was a slight 9% rebound in hedge fund positions in Q1, during which Crowdstrike posted promising Q4 results and boasted a record Q1 pipeline.Closing out the first half of our list of hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds is CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), yet another company that has been successfully using AI, in this case to bolster the speed and efficiency of its cybersecurity solutions. CrowdStrike’s extensible platform has clearly struck a positive note with the majority of its clients, over 60% of which use at least five of the company’s modules. CrowdStrike isn’t overly profitable yet, but it is beginning to generate more free cash flow, a figure which could top $1 billion in the company’s current fiscal year.Artisan Developing World Fund discussed CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)’s latest financial results in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Top contributors to performance for the quarter included graphics semiconductor company Nvidia, Southeast Asian e-commerce platform Sea, Latin American marketplace MercadoLibre, online travel marketplace Airbnb, and endpoint security company CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD). CrowdStrike rebounded as its financial results eased demand-related concerns in its core endpoint business, while adoption in platform adjacencies continued to rise.” Tesla, Inc.

These new integrations will help solve the problem of accessing and understanding data and allow companies to use their data to power AI insights across their business that drive better customer experiences.Go Deeper: Turning business data into actionable insights and personalized experiencesSalesforce Data Cloud + Google BigQueryThe new integration between Salesforce Data Cloud and BigQuery will enable companies to more easily create unified profiles of their customers to provide new, highly personalized experiences. Salesforce and Google Cloud will provide customers with seamless data access across platforms and across clouds, akin to having their data housed in a single location — with zero-copy or zero-ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) that can reduce the cost and complexity of moving or copying it while maintaining governance and trust.Story continuesSalesforce Data Cloud + Google Vertex AINew integrations between Salesforce Data Cloud and Google Cloud's Vertex AI will enable customers to bring their own models from Vertex and use them across the Salesforce Platform, addressing the specific needs of their businesses – such as predicting buying behavior or churn likelihood – across their Salesforce Customer 360 data. Zero-copy data access for AI model training can maximize a company's AI investment by providing immediate access to unified customer data, thereby streamlining the model development process and enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of AI predictions and insights.How industries will use Salesforce’s Data Cloud and Google’s BigQuery and Vertex AI to improve the customer experience and personalize interactionsA fashion retailer can connect CRM data, like customer purchase history and service interactions, with non-CRM data like real-time online activity or social media sentiment. They can then deploy custom AI models that predict customers’ likelihood to buy certain types of clothing based on that data, and deliver hyper-personalized recommendations to customers via the most appropriate channel, including email, a mobile app, or social media.A healthcare organization can connect CRM data, like appointment history and patient feedback, with non-CRM data like patient demographics and medical history data. They can then deploy custom AI models that predict which patients are at risk of readmission, which informs personalized care plans for those high-risk patients to improve medical outcomes through proactive medical care.A financial institution can connect CRM data, like a customer's transaction history, credit score, and financial goals, with non-CRM data like market analysis or economic trends. They can then deploy custom AI models that predict a customers’ spending habits, investment preferences, and financial goals to inform personalized banking services and offers.Quotes:""AI and data are revolutionizing the way businesses operate and innovate, and together Salesforce and Google are empowering organizations to unlock the full potential of their trusted data, put AI insights into action, and personalize customer experiences like never before.

(NWSA) Now Trades Above Golden Cross: Time to Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/news-corp-nwsa-now-trades-135504805.html,1686146104.0,STORY,['NWSA'],"[From a technical perspective, News Corporation (NWSA) is looking like an interesting pick, as it just reached a key level of support. NWSA's 50-day simple moving average crossed above its 200-day simple moving average, which is known as a ""golden cross"" in the trading world.There's a reason traders love a golden cross -- it's a technical chart pattern that can indicate a bullish breakout is on the horizon. This kind of crossover is formed when a stock's short-term moving average breaks above a longer-term moving average. Typically, a golden cross involves the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.A successful golden cross event has three stages. It first begins when a stock's price on the decline bottoms out. Then, its shorter moving average crosses above its longer moving average, triggering a positive trend reversal. The third and final phase occurs when the stock maintains its upward momentum.This kind of chart pattern is the opposite of a death cross, which is a technical event that suggests future bearish price movement.NWSA could be on the verge of a breakout after moving 11.9% higher over the last four weeks. Plus, the company is currently a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank.Looking at NWSA's earnings expectations, investors will be even more convinced of the bullish uptrend. For the current quarter, there have been 1 changes higher compared to none lower over the past 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up as well.Given this move in earnings estimates and the positive technical factor, investors may want to keep their eye on NWSA for more gains in the near future.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is News Corporation (NWSA). NWSA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 23.99, which compares to its industry's average of 25.36. Over the past 52 weeks, NWSA's Forward P/E has been as high as 27.67 and as low as 13.47, with a median of 19.51.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is NWSA's P/B ratio of 1.19. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.39. Within the past 52 weeks, NWSA's P/B has been as high as 1.36 and as low as 0.94, with a median of 1.11.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that News Corporation is likely being undervalued right now.

Despite the anticipation that China’s economic reopening would rekindle some lost vigor, many energy stocks are in a troubling position. Mounting oil inventories and growing concerns over recession have compelled investors to ponder over which energy stocks to sell in June to cut losses.Although long-term supply constraints could eventually spur oil prices, the short-to-medium-term outlook forecasts lower energy prices. After a stellar performance in 2022, the energy sector has witnessed a significant downturn in 2023, with an 11.2% drop, according to the S&amp;P Global 1200 Energy index, underperforming the broader S&amp;P 500. Moreover, crude oil and regular gas prices in the U.S. are subdued, with projections hinting at continued low prices. Thus, it becomes imperative to identify the top underperforming energy stocks to sell now.MROMarathon Oil$22.47ENPHEnphase Energy$181.47TELLTellurian$1.22NOVNOV.

Despite this, its stock, intriguingly, has dipped more than 22% in the last six months. Though its lackluster stock performance last year was somewhat puzzling, it appears more justified as we progress further into this year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe plunge in oil and gas prices is a major factor weighing down Marathon and its peers, casting a long shadow on forthcoming quarterly results. U.S. oil and gas prices, particularly, took a major hit in the opening months of 2023. Top-line growth rates for Marathon in the past couple of quarters are firmly in the negative. Moreover, the firm’s analyst consensus revenue estimate for the year is at $6.8 billion, with a 10.4% drop from 2022 levels. Therefore, it’s perhaps best to steer clear of the stock for now.Story continuesTop Underperforming Energy Stocks: Enphase Energy (ENPH)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockEnphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) is a top residential solar inverter realm player, boasting a robust growth pathway. However, a few prickly obstacles have greatly shadowed its prospects. The stagnation of the U.S. solar sector last year, along with the macro slowdown and reduced price credits under California’s NEM 3.0, are major headwinds. The new law clips the wings of solar customers, offering a staggering 75% less compensation for surplus energy sold to the grid.Furthermore, Enphase Energy’s second-quarter revenue guidance was indicative of these growing tribulations. Its projected sales fall in the $700 million and $750 million, falling shy of Wall Street’s highly optimistic $772.8 million estimate. This downbeat forecast reflects the firm’s weakening position in the U.S. market, and rising interest rates threaten to dampen investor enthusiasm further for ENPH stock.Tellurian Energy (TELL)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockNatural gas play Tellurian Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:TELL) is coming off an extraordinary year in 2022, with its fourth-quarter production reaching a whopping 225 million cubic feet daily. However, the company doesn’t anticipate a further upswing in production for 2023, painting a subdued picture this year.In the meantime, Tellurian keeps chiseling away at the Driftwood project; but the narrative remains as murky as ever. The challenging macro outlook pushes the company’s capital requirements for Driftwood’s construction upward. This is happening amidst a precarious financial position, with the firm ending the first quarter with just $150 million in cash and equivalents. Alarming forecasts suggest the firm could run dry within a year, further compounded by the potential shareholder dilution as convertible note holders are ready to cash in on $165 million of convertibles. With it burning through roughly $75 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, it’s no wonder why its investors are in a spot of bother.NOV Inc. (NOV)earningsSource: ShutterstockProminent oil and gas player, NOV Inc. (NYSE:NOV) is facing an uphill battle as the U.S. oil and gas rig count drops. Reports suggest that the first quarter saw a drop of 24 rigs, the first quarterly decrease in over three years. The decrease in drilling activity and potential production will naturally lead to lower demand for equipment and services the company provides.The recent banking crisis further complicates the situation for companies in the energy sector. Given the boom in oil prices this year, most companies have seen their sales and earnings surge. In contrast, the firm hasn’t turned a quarterly profit in nearly three years, leaving it incredibly vulnerable to more downside ahead if energy markets weaken further.Peabody Energy (BTU)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockPeabody Energy (NYSE:BTU) one of the world’s leading coal companies, is facing an inevitable twilight. Sure, 2022 was a comeback year for coal. Disruptions to the oil and natural gas markets sparked by Ukraine’s invasion fueled a surge in global prices. Consequently, BTU stock surged from $10 to $32.However, coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel, and with the global emphasis on cleaner energy sources, Peabody is far from being an ideal energy stock. Moreover, as 2023 sets in, the coal sector is bracing for tougher times with natural gas prices tumbling. Thus, for Peabody and its counterparts, the future looks like a steep downhill slope. However, at this point, its business remains in relatively strong shape, with attractive numbers across both lines. Over the long run, though, it’s tough to get excited about the stock.Chesapeake Energy (CHK)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockA splendid ride on the energy price wave saw Chesapeake Energy (NASDAQ:CHK) registering a rock-solid performance last year. The firm mainly deals in natural gas, as it effectively cashed in on surging prices, more than doubling its sales to a whopping $11.74 billion. However, in all likelihood, expect its results to fall dramatically back to pre-pandemic levels. Hence, CHK stock sends a clear warning signal to prospective investors.Despite the clean slate, critics argue whether its previous missteps overshadow its future. Moreover, the firm’s tale is laced with past tribulations, notably its 2020 bankruptcy filing and subsequent emergence as a new public equity in 2021. Coupled with the U.S. government’s commitment to net zero by 2050, the firm faces a proverbial ticking clock. Hence, CHK stock appears less like an investment opportunity and more like a gamble against time and tides of change at this time.ConocoPhillips (COP)a businessman with his thumb facing downSource: ShutterstockConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) has been struggling lately due to uncertainties surrounding its Willow Project in Alaska’s North Slope. The project faced a critical environmental review, resulting in the Biden Administration rejecting two out of five proposed drilling sites, shrinking its overall footprint by 40%. Speculation before the decision had also cast doubts on the project’s economic viability under a reduced scope.On top of that, its business is struggling immensely, with forward revenue growth estimates to just 9.7%, from its 5-year average of 31%. It finds itself in an unconducive energy market, likely to result in an incredibly weak market. Moreover, profitability metrics are firmly in the red, yielding just 1.3%, with a 5-year growth rate of 0%. Hence, avoiding the stock is best, as it trades over 10.3 times its forward cash flows.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing GuidelinesMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

58,8fcbaef0-1526-3858-bcf9-bf2c238ae13b,MSI,2023-06-08,Motorola ditched cell phones and found a lucrative second act. Now it’s one of tech’s biggest turnaround stories,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/motorola-ditched-cell-phones-found-100000756.html,1686218400,STORY,['MSI'],"[Last August, not long after the devastating school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, officials in Houston—like many others across the state and the country—upped spending on safety measures. The city approved $2.3 million worth of new gear for its dedicated school security division. More than half of that money went to just one company: Motorola Solutions.Motorola once dominated cell phones, but in the past few years it has become a huge player in public safety—one of the hottest areas in tech. While many big tech companies have struggled recently, Motorola sales and earnings per share both rose by double-digit percentages in 2022, while cash flow from operations increased 40%, and the company rose to No. 418 on the Fortune 500.None of that business came from cell phones, the revolutionary product that Motorola invented—producing the world’s first working mobile phone in 1973—and that made it a household name. Eclipsed by Apple and other smartphone manufacturers, Motorola shed its money-losing consumer phone unit, including its signature Razr flip phone, along with its cell tower business and others, starting in 2008. (Motorola-branded phones are still for sale, but they’re now made by Chinese computer giant Lenovo.)What remained was the company’s police radio business, a steady-selling but unsexy product that many thought would also soon be replaced by smartphones. Instead, the company’s foothold in that market—along with nearly three dozen acquisitions in recent years—has helped make Motorola the 800-pound gorilla in a business that is, unfortunately, booming. Mass shootings, rising crime rates, and public concern over police brutality have created a growing market for technology that can strike a balance between public safety and a reduced use of force. Security spending increases like Houston’s, in the public and private sectors alike, are becoming routine, and Motorola has positioned itself to serve the growing market.Story continuesThe person responsible for Motorola’s revival is CEO Greg Brown, who took over the top job at the company in 2008 and has led the company’s transformation around its security business. “I knew from the first day I joined Motorola that the best part of the company was the part few cared about,” Brown tells Fortune. “Motorola could do a lot more by doing less.”Less has definitely been more: Three-quarters of Motorola’s sales, which are expected to approach $10 billion this year, now comes from police and fire departments, 911 call centers, and other state- and city-run public safety departments. That makes the company about 10 times the size of its closest rival, Axon Enterprise, which is best known for its Taser stun guns but is also the leading maker of body cameras. Public spending on the category seems likely to keep growing: President Biden’s recent American Rescue Plan included $10 billion in spending on public safety tech. Motorola is also benefiting from an upgrade cycle. In October, for instance, Florida’s Miami-Dade County agreed to pay Motorola $165 million over 10 years to buy the company’s latest version of its first responder communicators, which are dubbed smart radios, and which now have touch screens and can run apps.Greg Brown, CEO of Motorola SolutionsOne of Motorola’s latest products is the M500, an automated surveillance and command center for patrol cars. It’s not quite RoboCop, but it’s close. Front and rear cameras automatically monitor for threats, scanning anyone approaching for weapons. Body cameras, which Motorola also makes, can be hooked up to the system. All that imagery is fed into A.I. software that runs on a specialized in-car computer system; the system can issue an automated danger alert to the officers in the car, as well as to police dispatchers or 911 call centers, many of which are also running on Motorola’s systems. Motorola’s marketing materials say the M500 is “not just eye observing, it’s brain analyzing.”The fastest-growing portion of Motorola’s business, however, is its line of security products for hospitals, event spaces, and schools. State Farm Stadium in Arizona used Motorola cameras and software to monitor the crowd at this year’s Super Bowl. In December, Motorola bought a company that makes a panic button system already used in thousands of schools to quickly lock down classrooms and call for help. A Motorola camera connected to its A.I. software can “watch” a sensitive area and detect and report unusual activity on its own. “You used to look at video after something bad happened,” says Motorola’s chief technology officer Mahesh Saptharishi. “We now have the capability to make video into something that can be used as a prevention method.”As the company has grown and expanded into new businesses, it has also been the target of more attention and scrutiny. Three years ago, Motorola bought Vigilant Solutions, a small company that specializes in license plate readers—automated, high-speed cameras that can be mounted on squad cars or at intersections to capture millions of images of passing vehicles. The American Civil Liberties Union and other privacy advocacy groups argue that such devices often violate U.S. privacy protections. Vigilant has faced criticism for selling access to its database of license plate images to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agencies that target immigrants. More recently, advocacy groups, in the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, have warned that license plate readers could be used to enforce local laws that forbid residents from traveling out of state to obtain abortions. “We have companies like Motorola that are promoting these miracle solutions for crime reduction, but that is just salesmanship,” says David Maass, director of investigations at the privacy-focused nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation. “I don’t think anyone is taking steps to mitigate the unintended consequences, like racial bias, and other ways that these new technologies may skew law enforcement.”For the moment, many of these concerns remain purely hypothetical. There’s no evidence, for example, that Motorola’s devices or software have been used to target people traveling for abortion care. Motorola says it puts controls in place to make sure its products are in compliance with local and federal laws, including privacy laws. The company does not allow individuals to buy access to license plate databases that it maintains, and Motorola notes that these databases only track car locations and do not include any personal information about the owners. More broadly, Motorola says it provides tools and protections to try to ensure its technology is being used for its intended purpose, which is to promote safety; how its products will actually be used is up to police departments, local officials, and lawmakers.Regardless of the controversy, Motorola stands out for now as one of the great tech turnaround stories in recent market history. Nearly all of the companies that Motorola once competed with, including BlackBerry, Ericsson, and Nokia, are worth a fraction of what they were at their peak, unable to pivot to new ventures. Motorola is the one exception; with a market cap of about $48 billion in early June, it is worth more than it was back when Razr phones were the hot new gadget. “Greg Brown has been a success on many levels,” says Keith Housum, an analyst who follows the company at Northcoast Research. “The stock has blossomed, and the company has been transformed completely.”From cell phones to surveillanceMotorola, or some version of it, has been on the Fortune 500 every year since the list’s debut in 1955; as recently as the 1990s, it was one of the 25 biggest companies in the U.S. by revenue. But the company eventually lost its competitive edge—prompting a makeover whose story starts with Carl Icahn.In 2007, the activist investor and corporate raider bought a stake in Motorola, demanding board seats and ultimately backing a plan to spin off the money-losing phone business. Then-CEO Ed Zander, who had revived the company with the launch of the ultrathin Razr in 2004, was resistant. Zander, though, was prone to public gaffes. In April 2007, the CEO told the Wall Street Journal: “I love my job; I hate my customers.” Icahn and others seized on the quote, questioning Zander’s ability to lead a consumer-products company. Within a year Zander was out, and Brown, who had run Motorola’s nonconsumer businesses before being elevated to Zander’s No. 2, was in.Chart shows Motorola Fortune 500 rank history since 1955Chart shows Motorola revenues since 2012At that time, cell phones still brought in about three-quarters of Motorola’s revenue. But it was clear, at least to Brown, that the company was falling farther and farther behind. By the time Brown took over, the iPhone was six months old and starting to thrive. Motorola had added iTunes to a number of its handsets, as well as Space Invaders. But even the company’s top phones were low-IQ, at best. Brown, like Icahn, quickly came to the conclusion that Motorola was never going to be able to catch up to Apple. In March 2008, just two months after becoming CEO, Brown announced a breakup that moved the surviving company—the Motorola that Brown would run and continues to run today—out of the phone business.Brown, 62, has seemed to gravitate toward difficult jobs—and to be comfortable ruffling customers’ feathers. One of his first business ventures, he tells Fortune, involved painting house numbers on curbs. Brown, then a student at Rutgers University in New Jersey, would go out very early in the morning, and paint 125 house numbers—unsolicited by the homeowners. He would drop off his contact information at each home, then go back later to see if the person was willing to pay for the job. (He says he also offered to remove the number free of charge.)It was in this job, Brown explains, that he first got experience making deals with police departments. Brown knew that curbs were public property, not owned by homeowners. Before heading out to a new town, he would pitch local police on the fact that curb numbers were beneficial to first responders. That, along with advance notice, got Brown a solicitor’s license as well as protection if a homeowner reacted angrily.At Motorola, Brown is a picky hirer, more interested in getting the right person than just filling an opening, and he prizes candidates who show a capacity to learn. “He spends an enormous amount of time on people and talent,” says Rajan Naik, who was hired by Brown in 2016 to be Motorola’s chief strategy officer. Brown calls recruiting and retention the “secret sauce” of what has made him and Motorola a success. He is also known for his attention to detail. During the pandemic, Naik says, Brown avoided the common corporate practice of appointing a crisis task force. Instead, the CEO would call Naik and other executives daily to troubleshoot. “I don’t like the phrase task force, because it implies it’s outside of the business and special,” says Brown. “We just flexed the management muscle that had already been built.” When Brown became aware of a supply-chain issue, Naik says, Brown would phone the supplier’s CEO to navigate the problem. “It didn’t matter if it was a $3 or a 30-cent part that was causing the problem,” says Naik. “He would understand to the third or fourth level down of suppliers what was causing the bottleneck.”Brown has been well rewarded for his role in Motorola’s success. His total pay package was just over $21 million for 2021, making him one of the highest-compensated executives in Chicago, where Motorola is based. Two years ago, Bruno Mars performed at the wedding of Brown’s son: The affair, which was held at a high-end hotel on Cape Cod and also featured Michelin-starred chef Mario Carbone, was widely covered in the celebrity press as one of the most over-the-top events of the year.It took a while for Brown to reap such rewards, because Motorola’s turnaround was far from an overnight development. The company split-up was announced in 2008, but it took until 2011 to actually spin off the cell-phone unit. Two years later, the company was still struggling financially. Brown explored selling the company but got no acceptable bids. Motorola’s stock price had bottomed out at around $60, and its available cash had fallen perilously low.For Brown, getting out of the rut involved letting go of a favorite business. Despite its avowed commitment to safety and security technology, Motorola had held on to a firm that made handheld computers and scanners used primarily by UPS, FedEx, and other shippers to track packages. Brown still had faith in that business—he had been personally in charge of integrating it after its purchase in 2007—but sales had stagnated. In mid-2013, Motorola bit the bullet and sold the unit for $3.5 billion, or $500 million less than it had paid, to Zebra Technologies.That divestment freed the company to focus fully on security. In May 2015, Motorola got a $1 billion investment from venture capital firm Silver Lake. At the time, it was one of the largest single investments ever made by Silver Lake, which tended to specialize in high-tech startups. In sealing the deal, Brown was hands on. Brown is an avid Chicago Bulls fan, but he left town while his team was in the NBA playoffs so he could go to San Francisco to meet with Silver Lake’s managing partner, Egon Durban, who needed back surgery and couldn’t travel. Brown met Durban at his home: After negotiations, the two watched the Bulls game. Durban joined Motorola’s board later that year and is still a director. “Everything we do is predicated on trust,” says Durban. “We knew that Greg had the ability to run a much larger business.”Brown has grown Motorola mostly through acquisitions: The company has bought 35 firms since 2015. Most have been relatively small, and only a few have added a significant amount of revenue on their own. And cumulatively, the deals have added a good deal of debt. Motorola now has $6 billion in long-term debt, up from just over $3 billion at the end of 2011—a relatively high amount compared with Motorola’s annual revenue.Brown says his focus for deals hasn’t been immediate growth but rounding out Motorola’s product offerings for the long term. The $1 billion acquisition of Avigilon in 2019, for instance, is the basis for most of the company’s video capabilities, which many analysts point to as key in Motorola’s future growth. And part of Motorola’s pitch is that it’s a one-stop shop, as well as being compatible with equipment from rivals. Private businesses that buy from Motorola can also quickly connect their safety systems to those of local law enforcement. “How we have built the company, how we have expanded our services, and what has driven us is not just about revenue or earnings,” says Brown. “Supporting and partnering with frontline first responders is fundamental to what we do.”Another part of Brown’s pitch is that Motorola does almost no business in China, where interference with private businesses has become a major source of concern for tech companies and Washington. Motorola knows this firsthand. The company is in a long-running legal dispute with Hytera Communications, alleging the Chinese rival stole its intellectual property. Hytera has countersued, saying Motorola maintains a monopoly in the U.S. in the radio emergency communications market. In 2020, a jury in federal court in Illinois ruled that Hytera must pay Motorola $746 million, later knocked down to $600 million, for the IP theft, but Hytera is appealing the ruling, and has yet to pay. All that has soured Motorola on doing business in China.“The rationale for investing in China has completely changed from 35 years ago,” says Brown. “Intellectual property theft is real and pervasive. Today, companies need to be clear-eyed about China and proceed at their own risk.”Risks and rewards So far Brown’s approach appears to be working. Motorola’s sales topped $9 billion last year, up from $5.6 billion in 2015. Earnings have more than doubled, to $1.3 billion last year. Analysts expect earnings to rise another 10% this year. Investors have noticed, pushing shares of Motorola up nearly 150% in the past five years, far outpacing such high-flying tech stocks as Alphabet and Amazon and about double the rise of the Nasdaq Composite index over the same period. At a recent $278, its stock price is up 25%, and it touched an intraday record-high of $299 in May—though at a price-to-earnings multiple of 35, the shares are now costly in the eyes of some analysts.By far the biggest risk for Motorola is that its fast-growing business touches on so many issues—privacy, gun violence, and police brutality—that provoke contention and, sometimes, litigation. Motorola was sued by Uvalde parents last year, along with the gun manufacturer, the school district, and others, in the wake of the town’s school shooting; the parents alleged that Motorola’s equipment failed the town’s first responders during the incident. (Motorola says the lawsuit is “without merit.”) Two years ago, a class action suit was filed against a division of Vigilant, alleging the company violates privacy laws. That lawsuit was dismissed, but last year, an advocacy group, the New Civil Liberties Alliance, sued two Florida cities, saying their use of license plate readers purchased from Vigilant violated Fourth Amendment protections. (Vigilant and Motorola were not named in that litigation, which is ongoing.)Students are monitored by a camera as they leave a school building.Of course, the debate over public safety and how to achieve it in a way that is fair for all draws more focus on the topic—which could in turn stoke opportunity for Motorola. “How communities and emergency responders effectively manage public safety is one of the most complicated questions that we face as a society, and that’s what Motorola is tackling,” says Silver Lake’s Durban. And Durban, like other investors, seems convinced that Motorola is tackling those problems better and faster than its bigger predecessor company would have.

Motorola Solutions will showcase its next generation 9-1-1 call routing and command center solutions - along with its GIS mapping and call handling managed services, which Utah PSAPs also use - at this month’s NENA 2023 conference.""The Utah Communications Authority’s 29 PSAPs field an average of 86,450 9-1-1 calls each month,"" said Tina Mathieu, deputy director of the Utah Communications Authority (UCA). ""Each call deserves a consistently fast response, as the caller is often hurt, scared or living in a moment where they need immediate support. Our completed statewide next generation 9-1-1 deployment has been game-changing, cutting misrouted calls in half and shaving 37.4 hours from our emergency response in the first three months of the year so our first responders reached callers much more quickly.""Motorola Solutions is among the first providers to offer 9-1-1 call routing grounded in NENA i3 standards. Its next generation 9-1-1 call routing technology uses the wireless caller’s location to deliver the 9-1-1 call to the correct PSAP with the authority to deploy local resources. Legacy methods route the 9-1-1 call based on the location of the wireless carrier tower the caller is connected to, which often directs the call to a PSAP outside the caller’s area, requiring a transfer and adding an average of 40 seconds in wait time, which can seem like an eternity to a person in need of immediate help.""NENA’s i3 standard is the foundation for interoperable, resilient next generation 9-1-1 systems across the nation,"" said Brian Fontes, CEO of NENA. ""It’s a comprehensive, consensus-based and commonly accepted open standard for next generation 9-1-1, and we’re happy to see providers like Motorola Solutions use it as a roadmap to more effectively connect the public to 9-1-1.""Story continues""Motorola Solutions’ next generation call routing can route 9-1-1 calls based on a wireless caller’s location regardless of whether the wireless carrier is providing the location with the 9-1-1 call,"" said Dan Twohig, vice president of NGCS at Motorola Solutions. ""How quickly you can get help in an emergency starts with how fast our technology correctly routes your 9-1-1 call. In saving seconds, we’re saving lives.""Additionally, Utah PSAPs across the state use Motorola Solutions’ NENA i3-compliant VESTA 9-1-1 and CommandCentral Aware for 9-1-1 for call handling, and some local agencies also use Rave Smart911, which saves time by allowing community members to share critical information like medical conditions or emergency contacts in advance with 9-1-1.""The state’s next generation 9-1-1 deployment, coupled with our use of Motorola Solutions’ Rave Smart911, allows us to not only respond to emergencies faster but to communicate with callers silently through text for enhanced situational context,"" said Kristi Walker, 9-1-1 Director at Logan City Police Department.Motorola Solutions’ next-generation 9-1-1 call routing is being deployed by North American agencies serving more than 44.7M people. The company will showcase this and its full suite of command center offerings at NENA 2023, booths 404 and 223, June 17-22 in Grapevine, Texas.

""But I'm impressed with a couple of startups, including Inflection.""That's not all Gates talked about during the Goldman Sachs and SV Angel event. He also touched on the following:Future digital agent development: Gates believes that the development of a powerful, future digital agent will take some time before it’s ready for the mainstream. In the meantime, companies will continue to incorporate generative AI technologies, similar to OpenAI’s widely used ChatGPT.AI's impact on health innovations: He mentioned that his work with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has focused on health-related initiatives. He is confident that AI will hasten advancements in healthcare and pave the way for more sophisticated drug development processes.Progress in disease treatment: Despite the complexity of the human brain still baffling scientists, Gates is optimistic about humanity’s progress in developing drugs to treat diseases like Alzheimer’s. He suggested that human trials for such new medications could be initiated within the next decade.AI’s influence on white-collar and blue-collar jobs: Gates sees the advent of generative AI technologies, capable of generating convincing text, as a game-changing factor that could affect white-collar jobs.Story continuesAll of this information makes it easy to see that Gates is bullish on the future of AI and its ability to have a positive impact on individuals and businesses alike.Investing In AI StartupsThanks to changes in federal law, it’s actually possible for everyday investors to invest in startups on platforms like StartEngine and Wefunder. And AI startups have become some of the most popular startup investments among retail investors. AtomBeam, for example, uses AI to compact data by up to 75% and previously raised nearly $2.5 million from retail investors on StartEngine. On Wefunder, startups like Snapify have developed AI-based solutions for the photography industry and seen significant traction.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

GAAP SG&amp;A was 31.8% of sales, 280 basis points higher versus Q1 of FY23 due to deleveraging on lower volume and incremental investments.GAAP operating income was $101.7 million or 6.1% of sales, compared to $0.2 million in Q1 of FY23.Non-GAAP operating income was $106.5 million, or 6.4% of sales, compared to $194.6 million, or 10.6% of sales in prior year first quarter.

Q1 of FY23 included significant discrete tax benefits associated with the previously disclosed litigation settlement of $47.7 million and the pension settlement loss of $25.0 million. On a non-GAAP basis, income tax expense was $14.7 million compared to income tax expense of $18.6 million in Q1 of FY23.GAAP diluted EPS was $1.79, up from a loss of $1.89 per diluted share in Q1 of FY23. GAAP diluted EPS includes $0.14 for integration-related charges for Blue Nile and income of $0.07 from a discrete tax benefit related to the UK pension buy-out. Excluding these charges (and related tax effects), diluted EPS was $1.78 on a non-GAAP basis. Q1 of FY23 on a GAAP basis included a $3.89 impact for a settlement of a previously disclosed litigation matter and $2.70 impact for a partial settlement charge for the buy-out of the UK pension plan.GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter of Fiscal 2024 include the impact of the preferred shares in the dilutive share count.Balance Sheet and Statement of Cash Flows Highlights:Cash used for operating activities was $381.8 million for Q1 of FY24 compared to cash used for operating activities of $135.5 million in Q1 of FY23. Cash and cash equivalents were $655.9 million as of quarter end, compared to $927.6 million in Q1 of FY23. The year over year change to cash and cash equivalents was driven the acquisition of Blue Nile and payment of legal settlements. The Company ended the first quarter with an Adjusted Debt to Adjusted EBITDAR ratio of 2.1x on a trailing 12-month basis, well below the stated goal of less than 2.75x, and was 1.7x on an Adjusted Net Debt basis.Inventory ended the quarter at $2.2 billion, down $33 million to Q1 of FY23 and excluding the acquisition of Blue Nile inventory was down more than $128 million.Capital Returns to Shareholders:Signet's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on common shares of $0.23 per share for the second quarter of Fiscal 2024, payable August 25, 2023 to shareholders of record on July 28, 2023, with an ex-dividend date of July 27, 2023.Year to date, Signet repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares at an average cost per share of $74.95, or $39.1 million. Approximately $761 million remains under the Company's multi-year authorization.Second quarter and Full year Fiscal 2024 Guidance:Forecasted non-GAAP operating income and diluted EPS provided below excludes potential non-recurring charges, such as asset impairments or integration-related costs associated with the acquisition of Blue Nile. However, given the potential impact of non-recurring charges to the GAAP operating income and diluted EPS, we cannot provide forecasted GAAP operating income or diluted EPS or the probable significance of such items without unreasonable efforts. As such, we do not present a reconciliation of forecasted non-GAAP operating income and diluted EPS to corresponding forecasted GAAP amounts.Signet's second quarter and full year Fiscal 2024 guidance for sales, operating income and diluted EPS is provided on a non-GAAP basis.Second QuarterFiscal 2024 (2)Total sales$1.53 billion to $1.58 billion$7.10 billion to $7.30 billionOperating income (1)$85 million to $100 million$635 million to $675 millionDiluted EPS (1)$9.49 to $10.09(1)See description of non-GAAP financial measures below.(2)Fiscal 2024 is a 53-week fiscal year for Signet, ending February 3, 2024, driven by the retail industry calendar. The additional week will occur in Q4 of Fiscal 2024 The Company's second quarter and full year Fiscal 2024 outlook is based on the following assumptions:Annual US Jewelry industry revenues are now expected to be down more than the Company's initial expectations of mid-single digits, driven by the impacts of macroeconomic factors on consumer spending and continued shift of consumer discretionary spend. The Company's guidance contemplates annual market share gains against this total industry performance range.Planned capital investments up to $200 million, reflecting investments in banner differentiation, including stores, Connected Commerce capabilities, and digital and technology advancement.The Company expects headwinds to continue in engagements with recovery later in Fiscal 2024, and continue to rebound in Fiscal 2025. Bridal overall, inclusive of engagements, historically represents nearly 50% of Signet's merchandise sales.Annual tax rate of approximately 19% excludes additional discrete items.Earnings per share for Fiscal 2024 excludes the impact of any further share repurchases beyond the shares repurchased through today, and includes the dilutive effect of the 8.1 million preferred shares.Our Purpose and Sustainable Growth:As a company with a Purpose-inspired business strategy, Signet is committed to ongoing leadership in Corporate Citizenship &amp; Sustainability and views Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"") initiatives as an important growth driver. Signet released its Fiscal 2023 Corporate Citizenship &amp; Sustainability Report including a progress report on its 2030 Corporate Sustainability Goals.

The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide more information to assist investors in evaluating historical trends and current period performance and liquidity. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release and the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.The Company reports the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (""EPS""), free cash flow, sales changes on a constant currency basis, and adjusted debt and adjusted net debt leverage ratios.Non-GAAP operating income is a non-GAAP measure defined as operating income excluding the impact of certain items which management believes are not necessarily reflective of normal operational performance during a period. Management finds the information useful when analyzing operating results to appropriately evaluate the performance of the business without the impact of these certain items. Management believes the consideration of measures that exclude such items can assist in the comparison of operational performance in different periods which may or may not include such items. Management also utilizes non-GAAP operating margin, defined as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of total sales, to further evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Company's flexible operating model.Non-GAAP diluted EPS is a non-GAAP measure defined as diluted EPS excluding the impact of certain items which management believes are not necessarily reflective of normal operational performance during a period. Management finds the information useful when analyzing financial results in order to appropriately evaluate the performance of the business without the impact of these certain items. In particular, management believes the consideration of measures that exclude such items can assist in the comparison of performance in different periods which may or may not include such items. The Company estimates the tax effect of all non-GAAP adjustments by applying a statutory tax rate to each item. The income tax items represent the discrete amount that affected the diluted EPS during the period.Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as the net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Management considers this metric to be helpful in understanding how the business is generating cash from its operating and investing activities that can be used to meet the financing needs of the business. Free cash flow is an indicator frequently used by management in evaluating its overall liquidity needs and determining appropriate capital allocation strategies. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes.The Company provides the year-over-year change in total sales excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to provide transparency to performance and enhance investors' understanding of underlying business trends. The effect from foreign currency, calculated on a constant currency basis, is determined by applying current year average exchange rates to prior year sales in local currency.The adjusted debt and adjusted net debt leverage ratios are non-GAAP measures calculated by dividing Signet's adjusted debt or adjusted net debt by adjusted EBITDAR. Adjusted debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as debt recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheet, plus Preferred Shares, plus an adjustment for operating leases (5x annual rent expense). Adjusted net debt, a non-GAAP measure, is adjusted debt less the cash and cash equivalents on hand as of the balance sheet dates. Adjusted EBITDAR is a non-GAAP measure, defined as earnings before interest and income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, other non-operating expense, net and certain non-GAAP accounting adjustments (""Adjusted EBITDA"") and further excludes minimum fixed rent expense for properties occupied under operating leases. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR are considered important indicators of operating performance as they exclude the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest, depreciation and amortization costs and certain accounting adjustments. Management believes these financial measures are helpful to investors and analysts to analyze trends in Signet's business and evaluate Signet's performance. The adjusted debt leverage ratio is a key priority of the Company's capital allocation strategy used in measuring the Company's optimized capital structure. The adjusted net debt leverage is supplemental to this ratio as it is deemed useful to both investors and management to consider cash on hand available to pay down debt. The adjusted debt and adjusted net debt leverage ratios are presented on a trailing twelve-month (""TTM"") basis, which uses Adjusted EBITDAR calculated on the prior four fiscal quarters.The following information provides reconciliations of the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to presented non-GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow13 weeks ended(in millions)April 29, 2023April 30, 2022Net cash used in operating activities$             (381.8)$             (135.5)Purchase of property, plant and equipment(27.1)(20.8)Free cash flow(408.9)(156.3) Non-GAAP operating income13 weeks ended(in millions)April 29, 2023April 30, 2022Total GAAP operating income$               101.7$                   0.2Litigation charges (2)(3.0)190.0Acquisition and integration-related costs (1)7.84.4Total non-GAAP operating income$               106.5$               194.6 North America segment non-GAAP operating income13 weeks ended(in millions)April 29, 2023April 30, 2022North America segment GAAP operating income$              124.7$                24.8Litigation charges (2)(3.0)190.0Acquisition and integration-related costs (1)7.84.4North America segment non-GAAP operating income$              129.5$              219.2 Non-GAAP income tax provision13 weeks ended(in millions)April 29, 2023April 30, 2022GAAP income tax expense (benefit)$                  9.5$              (55.2)Pension settlement loss4.125.0Acquisition and integration-related costs (1)1.91.1Litigation charges (2)(0.8)47.7Non-GAAP income tax expense$                14.7$                18.6 Non-GAAP effective tax rate13 weeks endedApril 29, 2023April 30, 2022GAAP effective tax rate8.9 %39.8 %Pension settlement loss3.4 %(10.1) %Acquisition and integration-related costs (1)1.5 %(0.4) %Litigation charges(2)(0.7) %(19.4) %Non-GAAP effective tax rate13.1 %9.9 % Non-GAAP diluted EPS13 weeks endedApril 29, 2023April 30, 2022GAAP diluted EPS$               1.79$              (1.89)Pension settlement loss—2.70Litigation charges (2)(0.06)3.89Acquisition and integration-related costs (1)0.140.09Dilution effect (3)—(0.43)Tax impact of items above (6)(0.09)(1.50)Non-GAAP diluted EPS$               1.78$               2.86 Adjusted debt and adjusted net debt leverage ratiosAs of(in millions)April 29, 2023April 30, 2022Adjusted debt and adjusted net debt:Long-term debt$          147.5$          147.1Redeemable Series A Convertible Preference Shares654.3652.6Adjustments:5x Rent expense2,237.02,235.0Adjusted debt$       3,038.8$       3,034.7Less: Cash and cash equivalents655.9927.6Adjusted net debt$       2,382.9$       2,107.1TTM Adjusted EBITDAR$       1,418.3$       1,588.1Adjusted debt leverage ratio2.1x1.9xAdjusted net debt leverage ratio1.7x1.3x13 weeks ended52 week period ended52 week period ended(in millions)April 29,2023April 30,2022May 1,2021January 28,2023January 29,2022April 29,2023April 30,2022Calculation:ABCDEA + D - BB + E -CAdjusted EBITDAR:Net income (loss)$         97.4$       (83.5)$     138.4$       376.7$       769.9$       557.6$       548.0Income taxes9.5(55.2)26.574.5114.5139.232.8Interest (income) expense, net(5.6)4.43.913.516.93.517.4Depreciation and amortization43.140.042.1164.5163.5167.6161.4Amortization of unfavorable contracts(0.5)(0.5)(1.4)(1.8)(3.3)(1.8)(2.4)Share-based compensation11.310.58.042.045.842.848.3Other non-operating expense,net (4)0.4134.5(0.1)140.22.16.1136.7Other accounting adjustments (5)4.8194.40.2245.54.755.9198.9Adjusted EBITDA$       160.4$       244.6$     217.6$    1,055.1$    1,114.1$       970.9$    1,141.1Rent expense111.0110.1106.4446.5443.3447.4447.0Adjusted EBITDAR$       271.4$       354.7$     324.0$    1,501.6$    1,557.4$    1,418.3$    1,588.1Footnotes to Non-GAAP Reconciliation Tables(1)Acquisition and integration-related costs include integration costs, primarily severance and retention, and exit and disposal costs, incurred for the integration of Blue Nile in Fiscal 2024, of which $1.3 million and $6.5 million was recorded to cost of sales and SG&amp;A, respectively.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.44bUS$2.86bUS$3.33bUS$3.67bUS$3.91bUS$4.09bUS$4.25bUS$4.39bUS$4.52bUS$4.65bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x11Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 4.67%Est @ 3.90%Est @ 3.37%Est @ 2.99%Est @ 2.73% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.9% US$2.2kUS$2.4kUS$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$24bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.9%– 2.1%) = US$70bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$70b÷ ( 1 + 8.9%)10= US$30bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$54b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$347, the company appears about fair value at a 17% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Parker-Hannifin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.135. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Parker-HannifinStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Machinery market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

It's all about the math.In the video that accompanies this article, I explain my first encounters with algo trading in the early 2000s and what I learned from the revolution created by Simons. I also give a recent update from another “rocket scientist who does markets” about whether and how ChatGPT changes the algo game.Right now, let’s continue with the Renaissance, or RenTech, story that gave us trading algos…The Secret Life of a TopologistAt MIT in the early 1960s, Simons specialized in differential geometry and the topology of manifolds, the study of curved spaces. When the young graduate student needed some extra money, he took a job in 1964 with the National Security Agency and Department of Defense to break Russian codes.As a “code breaker” between 1964 and 1968, Simons was also allowed to work half of his time on mathematical problems of his own interest. And he taught mathematics at MIT and Harvard.After being forced to leave the Institute for Defense Analysis due to his public opposition to the Vietnam War, he joined the faculty at Stony Brook University in 1968 and became chairman of the mathematics department, at only age 30. Advisors had encouraged him to go to Berkeley and work under Shing-Shen Chern, a professor who also had great interest in differential geometry.Eventually, the two would collaborate on a groundbreaking theory now called the Chern-Simons form. Without knowing much about physics, his and Chern’s work became a mathematical tool now used extensively in theoretical physics. From a 2000 article by Hal Lux in Institutional Investor magazine…""Chern-Simons pervades a whole class of theories that underlie our fundamental view of the observable world,"" says Brandeis University physicist Stanley Deser, an expert on supergravity, a discipline of quantum theory that studies elementary particles and their interaction.Simons would subsequently contribute to the development of string theory by providing a theoretical framework to combine geometry and topology with quantum field theory.Code-Breaker and Space Fan Goes to Wall StreetSimons left Stony Brook in 1978 and started Monemetrics to begin trading currencies. He’d always been interested in business, but found commodities more fascinating than stocks. At first, he didn’t even apply the mathematical modeling that was his expertise to currency data.But once he realized the power of mathematics in markets, he never looked back. By 1982, the Monemetrics name was changed to Renaissance Technologies and he started hiring other mathematicians to help him create models.RenTech went on to specialize in systematic trading using quantitative models derived from mathematical and statistical analysis. They created the mold for algorithms to make investment gains from market inefficiencies and pattern recognition.And one of its major sources of innovation was the fact that Simons would only hire quantitative specialists with non-financial backgrounds, including computer scientists, mathematicians, physicists, signal processing experts and statisticians. He never wanted the scent of Wall Street to foul up his data modeling.Simons Was Semi-AI Before NVIDIAOne of the wonderful elements of stories about great mathematicians like Simons who have applied their knowledge to complex but practical problems is how many of them did it without sophisticated software.Picture Simons cranking out complicated theorems with pencil on paper, or chalk on blackboards. And then when he learned to harness market data to do pattern recognition and create models, he still just had “ancient” computing power that only spit out signals to execute trades. The automated algo part was barely in its infancy in the 1980s.Now the “machine” of markets has taken over. And it’s only going to accelerate. In the video, I explain where and when you can still compete with the algos in trading.I also highlight three stocks and companies that have made a difference for investors who’ve followed me…Synopsys SNPS is the $65 billion maker of electronic design automation (EDA) software for the semiconductor and electronics industries. Synopsys offers a full suite of products used in the logic synthesis and functional verification phases of chip design, including a broad array of reusable design building blocks.I recommended Synopsys shares in March under $375 as part of my first report on ChatGPT where I explained the AI revolution wrought by NVIDIA NVDA and AMD GPU chips. You can get a copy of that report by emailing Ultimate@Zacks.com and tell ‘em Cooker sent you.In the video, I also mention Cadence Design Systems CDNS as another provider of systems design enablement (SDE) for chip makers. Cadence calls their proprietary brand of solutions Intelligent System Design (ISD) and Jensen Huang’s NVIDIA is a key customer because he values their capabilities to simulate before manufacture.Synopsys and Cadence are basically a ""duopoly"" in the software realm that semiconductor companies need to bring their ideas to life with simulation first before engineered solutions go to the foundry. This is critically important as NVIDIA and all its competitors are diving into the microscopic sub-5 nanometer world of integrated circuits.Be sure to watch the video to hear astrophysicist Michael Hobson from eyeQ talk about the impact of ChatGPT on his statistical models and algorithms for trading.Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA and CDNS for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Synopsys (SNPS) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to SNPS for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Synopsys' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Synopsys' main business drivers.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. The company offers a full suite of products used in the logic synthesis and functional verification phases of chip design, including a broad array of reusable design building blocks. It also sells physical synthesis and physical design products as well as physical verification products.The company’s products are used to design a chip, from concept to the point of delivery to the manufacturer for fabrication. Synopsis provides software and hardware, which are used to develop electronic systems that incorporate chips. Additionally, the company provides Intellectual Property (IP) used in semiconductor design and manufacturing to simplify the design process and accelerate time-to-market for its customers.Synopsis reports revenues in three segments, namely Time-Based Products, Upfront Products and Maintenance and Service.Time-Based Products (59% of fiscal 2022 revenues): Segment revenues are recognized as Technology Subscription License (TSL) revenues. Under this segment, the company recognizes revenues from fees over the period of the license or as and when the installments are paid by the customer, whichever is later.Upfront Products (24%): These revenues are recognized as Term License revenues. Under this segment, the company recognizes revenues from term licenses in full after the completion of the shipment of the software, wherein at least 75% of the license fee is paid within a year of shipment, after fulfilling all other revenue recognition criteria.Maintenance and Service (17%): Under this segment revenues come from maintenance fees that are generated over the maintenance period; along with revenues generated from professional service and training fees.The company conducts its business across four geographic regions namely: North America (47% of fiscal 2022 revenues), China (16%), Europe (10%), Korea (10%) and others (17%).Synopsys’ competitors include EDA vendors like Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corporation.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Synopsys ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $12,143.37, or a 1,114.34% gain, as of June 7, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 164.02% and gold's return of 36.81% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for SNPS.Synopsys is benefiting from strong design wins owing to a robust product portfolio. Growth in hybrid working trend is driving demand for bandwidth. Strong traction for Synopsys’ Fusion Compiler product boosted the top line. Growing demand for advanced technology, design, IP and security solutions is also creating solid prospects. Rising impact of artificial intelligence, 5G, internet of things and big data is driving investments in new compute and machine learning architectures. Our estimates suggest that Synopsys’ revenues will grow at a CAGR of 10.6% through 2023-2025. However, tightening corporate budget amid ongoing macroeconomic challenges and unfavorable currency exchange rates might hurt the company’s near-term growth prospect. Geopolitical challenges and restrictions over trade with Huawei are other woes.The stock is up 20.95% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 8 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The Dow Jones U.S. Hotel &amp; Lodging REITs Index is up by more than 5% since the turn of the year, implying the long-felt effects of the Covid-19 pandemic are behind us. Moreover, a U.S. interest rate pivot is on the horizon, likely providing a creditworthy tailwind to cyclical real estate assets such as hotels and resorts.If you share the same outlook on the property market as I do, then here are two hospitality-centric REITs to consider.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with HST. Click here to check it out. HST 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of HSTPeter Lynch Chart of HSTPark Hotels &amp; Resorts2 Hotel REITs to Consider Checking IntoHeadquartered in Tysons, Virginia, Park Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. (NYSE:PK) is a former Hilton-owned company that invests in premium hotels. With more than 33,000 rooms in total, it is one of the largest publically traded REITs and hosts an extensive market position.Apart from its robust market position, a big draw to the company is its most recent uptick in occupancy, which surged by 14.8% year over year as per the end of its second quarter, landing at 65%. Moreover, Park Hotels &amp; Resorts achieved adjusted free cash flow per share of 42 cents in the same quarter, up by 425% from the previous year.The illustrated combination of top-line growth and economic value added is yet to be priced by financial market participants as the asset is trading at a price-to-funds from operations ratio of 5.6, which outranks approximately 84.04% of Park Hotels &amp; Resorts' sector peers.2 Hotel REITs to Consider Checking IntoLastly, a salient feature worth mentioning is the REIT's recent land acquisition. In a deal worth $18 million, Park Hotels &amp; Resorts purchased a property adjacent to the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort. It also illustrates the company's ability to acquire prime real estate while cornering the market and fending off rising competition.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts2 Hotel REITs to Consider Checking IntoHost Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. (NASDAQ:HST) is the largest owner of lodging real estate and owns a variety of luxury hotel properties. The REIT's stock has gained by more than 5% since the turn of the year, which bodes well with its respectable dividend yield of 2.53%.Story continuesThe primary attraction to Host Hotels &amp; Resorts in today's market environment relates to the momentum it receives from industry-related occupancy levels that are only 7% adrift from their pre-pandemic levels. The industry's recovery was recently highlighted by independent research and trading firm Compass Point, which also believes the company provides ""the most liquid way to participate in the urban hotel recovery.""Furthermore, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts' latest financial results conveyed numerous talking points. First, in its third quarter, the REIT produced a 31.1% increase in revenue per available room, resulting in quarterly revenue of $1.38 billion. Over and above that, an Ebitda margin of 32.5% was achieved, suggesting the vehicle is more than capable of passing through multidecade-high inflation to its customers.A deeper look into the REIT's investment thesis illustrates why it is able to tolerate trying macroeconomic times. Host Hotels &amp; Resorts only invests in investment-grade lodges with synergetic opportunities. To expand on the latter, the group invests in properties that it believes integrate with its portfolio's ancillary service providers, such as operators. By phasing synergies into its corporate portfolio, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts is able to cut costs and provide its shareholders with excess returns.Lastly, the prospecting landscape for the REIT looks bright as it is in the middle of a renovation cycle and a management style transition, which it believes will both add to revenue and cut future costs.By and large, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts is an operating powerhouse that provides significant shareholder value.Noteworthy risksBefore considering a position in either of the REITs, it must be considered that hotel assets are tremendously risky. For instance, their prospects are inextricably linked to the economic environment, which is still uncertain. Additionally, hotel properties generate short-term cash flows due to high tenant turnover. Therefore, most stock market participants assign higher risk premiums to them, resulting in lower valuations.Final wordExpected returns on hotel REITs have rarely been brighter as the pandemic has abated, an interest rate cycle shift is en route and intra-industry recoveries have commenced.Among the most lucrative assets within the industry are Park Hotels &amp; Resorts, which has a phenomenal market position with its cunning ability to corner the market. Additionally, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts is in the process of a significant recovery as its revenue per available room is skyrocketing.As a result, both assets are showing signs of value and it is only a matter of time before investors latch onto them.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Goldman Sachs Group achieved compound earnings per share growth of 21% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 16% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 10.10 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Goldman Sachs Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Goldman Sachs Group, it has a TSR of 69% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Goldman Sachs Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 9.8% over one year. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 10% per year, is even more impressive. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

(GS): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-goldman-sachs-130007535.html,1686142807,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[Goldman Sachs (GS) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned +0.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Goldman falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Goldman is expected to post earnings of $7.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $31.57 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5%. This estimate has changed -0.8% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $36.26 indicates a change of +14.9% from what Goldman is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Goldman is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Goldman, the consensus sales estimate of $12.03 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.4%. The $48.18 billion and $51.51 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.7% and +6.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGoldman reported revenues of $12.22 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.5%. EPS of $8.79 for the same period compares with $10.76 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.03 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -6.16%. The EPS surprise was +7.99%.Over the last four quarters, Goldman surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Goldman is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Goldman. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

101,10e37937-bd1e-35a0-93bc-fdb75551a2a8,AIG,2023-06-08,"2 ""International"" Stocks to Buy for Steady Growth and Sound Value",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-international-stocks-buy-steady-001800881.html,1686183480,STORY,"['MAR', 'AIG']","[Two stocks that have continued edging higher to start the month are American International Group (AIG) and Marriott International (MAR). Both companies offer valuable exposure to their respective industries with operations worldwide.Now may be a good time to buy both of these conglomerates as they remain sound investments and their valuations are attractive at the momentSound Value Intriguingly, as a leading global insurance provider, American International Group currently has an “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for Value. At current levels, AIG stock is very attractive for its wide range of property casualty insurance, life insurance, retirement solutions, and other financial services in more than 80 countries.Similarly, among hotel operators, Marriott International gives valuable exposure to investors as a leading worldwide hospitality company focused on lodging management and franchising. Marriott has a “B” Style Scores grade for Value and remains attractive for its expansive reach with the company operating and franchising over 8,400 properties across 138 countries.P/E Valuation: Attributing to their high-Value grades are AIG’s and Marriott’s price-to-earnings valuations. Trading at $56 a share AIG trades at just 8.5X forward earnings which is on par with the industry average and nicely beneath the S&amp;P 500’s 19.9X.Furthermore, AIG is a leader in its space and trades 41% below its decade-high of 21.7X and at a 26% discount to the median of 11.5X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMarriott’s P/E valuation isn’t as eye-popping at 21.5X forward earnings but this is still near the benchmark and roughly on par with its industry average of 20.2X. Plus, Marriott is an industry leader and trades attractively relative to its past. Trading at $177 a share, Marriott still trades well below its own decade-long high of 301.5X and offers a slight discount to the median of 23.7X.Steady GrowthAs mature and renowned companies, AIG and Marriott’s growth is still intriguing and has become more attractive with earnings estimate revisions rising for the current fiscal year and FY24.Story continuesIn this regard, AIG’s earnings are now forecasted to soar 44% this year at $6.56 per share compared to EPS of $4.55 in 2022. Even better, AIG’s FY24 earnings are expected to jump another 20% at $7.88 per share. On the top line, sales are forecasted to be up 8% this year and rise another 3% in FY24 to $50.77 billion.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLooking at Marriott, earnings are projected to climb 25% in FY23 at $8.39 per share compared to EPS of $6.69 in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to rise another 8% at $9.08 per share. Total sales are forecasted to jump 13% this year and rise another 4% in FY24 to $24.35 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRespectable DividendsAlso intriguing to investors are AIG and Marriott’s respectable dividends. AIG especially stands out with a 2.29% yield at $1.28 per share. This is above the S&amp;P 500’s 1.48% average and its industry average of 2.10%.As inflation eases and AIG continues its post-pandemic growth and recovery it’s quite possible the company will be even more generous to shareholders. To that point, AIG stock had just hit its peak dividend yield at 6.6% prior to the pandemic as shown in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConsidering most Hotel operators are focused on sustaining growth and expansion rather than providing a dividend, Marriott's yield is also respectable at $1.15% or $2.08 per share. Marriott’s dividend should also increase as we move further from the pandemic and global economic headwinds subside.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWith both sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) AIG and Marriott stocks are up 7% and 5% respectively to start the month. Strong value, steady growth, and earnings estimate revisions trending higher over the last 60 days are good reasons to buy stock in both conglomerates.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The new product will directly provide customers with lump-sum cash benefits in case of a covered accidental injury.Washington National offers supplemental health and life insurance products to the middle-income group in the country. The new product will likely enable customers to pay for costs that are not covered in traditional health or disability insurance plans. The new product incorporates four levels of coverage and six optional benefit riders among other things.The Accident Insurance product has some competitive features, which differentiate it from other products offered in the market. It gives policyholders control over the benefits, complementing their existing health insurance plans, and providing them a much-needed financial security during tough times. The product is currently offered in 30 states and more states are expected to join the list later this year.The average cost of treatment of a non-fatal injury involving an emergency room visit is $6,620, per the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. However, 57% of the people are unable to afford an emergency expense of $1,000, per Fortune. This signifies the need for a product like Accident Insurance for financial security.Moves like this are expected to provide CNO Financial’s business with a competitive edge over its peers. Introducing new and updated products according to the market need will likely help it to generate higher premiums in the coming days. Its new annualized premiums for health and life products advanced 7% year over year in the first quarter to $96.6 million.Price PerformanceCNO Financial shares have increased 13.3% in the past year against the 13.5% fall of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksThe company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

104,a023e361-77f7-3fc3-90c1-07f79a6e1381,HOLX,2023-06-08,3 Reasons to Retain Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-retain-intuitive-surgical-184400808.html,1686163440,STORY,"['ISRG', 'HOLX', 'BSX']","[Intuitive Surgical, Inc. ISRG is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strength in robotics. The optimism led by solid first-quarter 2023 and its progress on the artificial intelligence (AI) front is expected to contribute further. The risk of procedure adoption and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 41.6% compared with the 2.3% rise of the industry and the S&amp;P 500’s 4.5% growth.The renowned provider of minimally invasive care and the pioneer of robotic-assisted surgery has a market capitalization of $110.63 billion. It projects 13% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Intuitive Surgical’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other two, with the average earnings surprise being 1.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strength in Robotics: We are upbeat about Intuitive Surgical’s robot-based da Vinci surgical system that enables minimally-invasive surgery and reduces the trauma associated with open surgery. The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology that has provided the company with solid exposure to medical mechatronics, robotics and AI for the healthcare space.Per the first-quarter 2023 earnings call in April, the installed base of da Vinci systems grew approximately 12% year over year. The utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, was up 13% from the prior-year quarter.Progress on the AI Front: We are upbeat about the growing adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, the use of information technology for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model. These indicate the high prevalence of AI in the MedTech space.Per Intuitive Surgical’s management, the rise of medical mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging has enabled new approaches to old problems. AI has been enhancing Intuitive Surgical’s product portfolio with clinical applications, diagnostic support, operational efficiency, electronic health record systems, practice workflows and supply chain management.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: Intuitive Surgical’s solid first-quarter 2023 results buoy our optimism. The company witnessed continued growth in da Vinci procedure volume.DownsidesRisk of Procedure Adoption: Intuitive Surgical faces the risk of adoption of its procedures. This is because adoption growth takes time, as each procedure needs to gain credibility. Furthermore, the wide use of the company’s products requires the training of surgical teams. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete such training.Stiff Competition: Intuitive Surgical used to enjoy a monopoly in the market for robots used in abdominal surgery since the launch of its flagship device, the da Vinci System, in 2000. However, after the regulatory approval of Transenterix's surgical robot for abdominal surgery in 2017, competition for Intuitive Surgical intensified.Estimate TrendIntuitive Surgical is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 3.8% north to $5.47.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.73 billion, suggesting a 13.8% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The raised 2023 guidance is a major upside. However, mounting expenses and stiff competition do not bode well.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has surged 72.2% against a 5.4% decline of the industry and a 6% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $15.38 billion. The company’s next-year expected growth rate of 28.7% compares favorably with the industry’s growth projection of 9.6%.Let’s delve deeper.Key DriversQ1 Upsides: Exact Sciences exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. The quarterly loss narrowed significantly from the year-ago period’s levels. Robust revenues from the Screening and Precision Oncology segments contributed to the first-quarter top line. During the quarter, 10,000 new healthcare professionals ordered Cologuard, bringing the total to over 312,000. The growing uptake of the company’s Oncotype DX Breast and therapy selection products are major advantages. The raised 2023 guidance is a major upside.Advancing New Solutions: With regard to the third priority of advancing new solutions, Exact Sciences is planning several key milestones to bring six innovative cancer diagnostics from its pipeline to patients in need.In February 2023, Exact Sciences launched OncoExTra therapy selection test in the United States. OncoExTra is a next-generation sequencing (NGS), comprehensive DNA and RNA-based genomic test providing doctors and their patients a complete molecular picture of the patient's cancer. The test provides reliable and actionable results personalized to each patient.During the November 2022 update, the company noted that it launched an innovative Cologuard collection kit to give patients more time to get their samples back to the lab. The kit displayed the power of the multi-cancer early detection approach at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress and making hereditary cancer test Riskguard available to oncologists through an early access program.Story continuesRaised Guidance: The company raised its 2023 revenue guidance to the range of $2.380-$2.420 billion (from the earlier guidance of $2.265-$2.315 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $2.26 billion.For 2023, the company expects its Screening revenues in the range of $1.770-$1.795 billion ($1.660-$1.690 billion). The company expects Precision Oncology revenues in the range of $605-$620 million ($600-$620 million). COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be $5 million (unchanged).DownsidesEscalating Costs: Exact Science adopted several strategies to improve its revenue performance. These include portfolio expansion and penetration in the international arena. So far, this has escalated costs and operating expenses for the company.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the first quarter of 2023, Exact Sciences’ General and administrative expenses rose 27.9%. Adjusted operating expenses dropped 0.9% year over year. The escalating costs are exerting significant pressure on the company’s bottom line.Tough Competitive Landscape: Given the large market for colorectal cancer screening, Exact Science faces numerous competitors, some of which possess significantly greater financial and other resources and development capabilities than the company.Estimate TrendIn the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Exact Sciences’ loss for 2023 has moved 25% north to $2.16.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.41 billion, suggesting a 15.5% rise from the 2022 reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Addus Homecare Corporation ADUS, Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

JPMorgan raising its price target on the stock to 470 bucks a share from 380. The analysts there saying that the streamer's paid sharing program is going to boost revenue over the next few years.

That was kind of the concern about, especially with paid sharing here, how many would actually opt out of that?Now, given what they saw in those four markets, JP Morgan saying essentially, they think there will be less of a recovery time when you compare it to some of those other markets as well.

That has been a huge concern for Affirm for some of the other competitors within the space out there. In terms of what this means for Amazon, Truist was out with a buy rating on this stock here.And also when it comes to Affirm, they're saying that this is a quote, ""digital wallet shot in the arm."" Talking about now it's going to give Affirm a little bit of an edge when you compare it to some of those competitors out there, given the fact that Apple has entered the space.

121,cf1d6315-4d98-38a8-b5df-bda77fa90940,AMGN,2023-06-08,3 Undervalued Biotech Stocks to Buy Before They Blast Off,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-undervalued-biotech-stocks-buy-115532339.html,1685706932,STORY,"['PFE', 'AMGN', 'GILD', 'HZNP']","[When investors hear the words “undervalued biotech stocks to buy,” they frequently think of companies in the clinical trial stage. That’s understandable. If you can buy a company’s stock before it releases a game-changing drug or therapeutic into the market, you can make a fortune. That line of thinking was displayed in 2020 when many biotech companies raced to produce a Covid-19 vaccine.But every investor also knows that many of those moonshots never pan out. That’s not the kind of uncertainty you need in this current market. A better option is to look at the companies that already have FDA-approved drugs in the market and a pipeline of potential products on the way. This increases your chance of success.And the good news is that there are several high-potential biotech stocks. By this, I mean the stocks are trading below the average price-to-earnings of the biotech sector, which is around 19x as of this writing. These stocks also have other catalysts that make them compelling stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPfizer (PFE)blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stockSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comPfizer (NYSE:PFE) remains one of the more polarizing stocks in the biotech sector. And unfortunately for investors, it’s also one of the most beaten-down stocks. Since closing at an all-time high of $59.48 on December 17, 2021, PFE stock is down 37%.Most of that drop has come in the last 12 months as the company continues to report lower demand for its Covid vaccine Comirnaty. This was evident in the company’s first quarter 2023 earnings report, which showed a sharp year-over-year decline in both revenue and earnings.However, it’s important to keep looking ahead in the biotech sector. And Pfizer certainly seems to be. It acquired Seagen (NASDAQ:SGEN) in March for $43 billion. This acquisition will allow Pfizer to build on its existing pipeline of oncology drugs. This sector will continue to be one of the largest drivers of revenue growth in the biotech sector. And Pfizer believes Seagen’s pipeline will contribute $10 billion in revenue by 2030.Story continuesIf that sounds appealing, now is a good time to buy PFE stock. It’s trading at just 7.3x earnings. And even if it takes some time to bring these cancer drugs to market, you’re rewarded with a dividend that currently yields 4.43% and has a sustainable payout ratio of around 32%.Amgen (AMGN)the Amgen (AMGN) logo on a building during daylightSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAmgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is next on this list of undervalued biotech stocks to buy. Growth through acquisition is a common strategy in this sector. So it is that Amgen won a bidding war for Horizon Therapeutics (NASDAQ:HZNP).The company may have overpaid for Horizon, but it secures Horizon’s pipeline of drugs that Amgen will add to its own stable, including its oncology drug, Enbrel. The company has built a patent thicket around Enbrel that keeps two patents crucial to its pricing power in place for at least five years. And now, the company will begin to benefit from Horizon’s in-market products and its pipeline, which include many late clinical-stage candidates.AMGN stock is down 17% in 2023, which belies the company’s strong fundamentals, including a free cash flow of $8.8 billion in 2022. Amgen reported $31.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents in the last quarter on its balance sheet. The company also expects to see adjusted earnings per share higher at the midpoint than in 2023.Plus, at 14.8x earnings, you can buy AMGN stock at a slight discount to the sector. And you get a dividend that currently has a yield of 3.93%.Gilead Sciences (GILD)A Gilead Sciences (GILD) sign at the company headquarters in Silicon Valley, California.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAnother biotechnology company pursuing a growth-through-acquisition strategy is Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD). GILD stock is down 11% for the year, but with a P/E ratio of around 17x, Gilead Sciences appears to be a biotech stock just waiting to explode.The bullish case can be seen in Gilead Sciences through a wider lens. The stock is up over 16% in the last five years. And of the 30 analyst ratings for GILD stock as of this writing, 12 have a Strong Buy for the stock. That was punctuated when BMO Capital Markets upgraded the stock to an Outperform with a new price target of $100.Expanding its research deal with Arcus Biosciences (NYSE:RCUS) may put a lid on earnings in the short term. But the two companies have a robust pipeline of oncology treatments. And now, the two companies are partnering to look for treatments for inflammatory diseases.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that OGE has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.OGE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.73, while NEE has a forward P/E of 23.62.

NEE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.82.Another notable valuation metric for OGE is its P/B ratio of 1.64. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

The alliance reflects BNY Mellon's broader commitment to financial inclusion, helping to connect unbanked and underbanked individuals and communities to high-quality financial services.According to a recent Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation survey, an estimated 4.5 percent of U.S. households (approximately 5.9 million) were ""unbanked"" in 2021, meaning that no one in the household had a checking or savings account at a bank or credit union. Further, an estimated 14.1 percent of U.S. households (approximately 18.7 million) were ""underbanked"" in 2021. An underbanked household is one that has a bank account but lacks adequate access to other traditional financial services. The new disbursement service, offered through BNY Mellon's Vaia platform, allows governments and corporate clients to seamlessly distribute payments and disbursements, such as disaster relief financial aid and employee payroll to individuals without financial services access. These often-vital cash injections can now reach the communities where they are needed most, timely and effectively. The opportunity to also receive basic banking services—including an FDIC-insured account as well as a debit card and credit reporting capabilities—will also be available for unbanked and underbanked individuals through the MoCaFi platform.Story continuesJennifer Barker, CEO of Treasury Services, BNY Mellon said: ""The inability to provide digital payments to a significant portion of the U.S. economy has been a major hurdle for both public and private sectors. Through our commitment to innovation, we met this challenge head on and are thrilled to join forces with a fintech doing outstanding, tangible work in our communities. Not only does this fit with BNY Mellon's values of making the financial ecosystem stronger, better and more accessible, it also promotes financial equity across the country for people in need.""Wole Coaxum, CEO and Founder of MoCaFi, said: ""Our alliance with BNY Mellon will accelerate our mission to reduce the racial and social wealth gap through increasing pathways to wealth for underserved individuals, especially communities of color. Access to modern banking services is one of the best approaches to making our economy more inclusive, and by working with BNY Mellon we are helping to provide opportunities to as many people as possible. Further, by joining the Vaia platform, we are creating a more seamless experience for corporations and municipalities from New York City to New Orleans and beyond to receive and distribute cash to a new pool of consumers.""About BNY MellonEstablished in 1784, BNY Mellon is America's oldest bank and the first company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BK).

While Generative AI models have been in development for years, the wide-scale productization of these models is a recent phenomenon with many vendors included in our analysis currently still in the beta or initial launch stage with their commercial products,"" said Nick Patience, managing analyst of Data, AI, Infosecurity &amp; Risk at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. ""However, we anticipate a rapid expansion of the market overall, with some sectors advancing faster than others. Overall, we think the impact of generative AI will be huge and change the way we work with language, images, code, audio and video.""Key highlights from the report include:While distinct media generation segments will likely coalesce over time, at its current stage of emergence, each segment demonstrates distinct market characteristics and competitive dynamics.The text generator space is particularly vibrant, with lower-than-expected costs of foundation model application programming interfaces (APIs) contributing to a burgeoning ecosystem of startups, many targeting sales and marketing use-cases. This sector is expected to expand at a CAGR of 50 percent from 2023 to 2028.Code generation represents a less mature market, with fewer monetized projects or established vendors. With a CAGR of almost 73 percent between 2023 and 2028, however, it may represent the fastest growing Generative AI segment.The image generation space is also forecast to have a robust growth trajectory growing 148 percent for 2023 year on year, with its five-year CAGR at 66 percent. The sector contains some high-profile startups and more recently the entrance of established technology providers with large, curated image libraries. It has proven an early target for copyright infringement lawsuits.Generative AI approaches to structured data generation are emerging, and are likely to benefit from growing concerns around privacy. Few vendors currently productize generative AI-based synthetic data services, but a number of prominent startups have emerged to drive growth in the embryonic space with a five-year CAGR of 59 percent.Story continuesTo arrange an interview with our experts or request a full copy of the S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence Market Monitor Generative AI report, please contact press.mi@spglobal.com.S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's opinions, statements, estimates, projections, quotes and credit-related and other analyses are statements of opinion as of the date they are expressed and not statements of fact or recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell any securities or to make any investment decisions, and do not address the suitability of any security, and there is no obligation on S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence to update the foregoing or any other element of the Property.

This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in PulteGroup (PHM) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to PHM for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?PulteGroup's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at PulteGroup's main business drivers.Based in Atlanta, GA, PulteGroup Inc. engages in homebuilding and financial services businesses, primarily in the United States. The company conducts operations through two primary business segments – Homebuilding (which accounted for 98.1% as of 2022 total revenues) and Financial Services (1.9%).The Homebuilding segment offers a wide variety of home designs including single family detached, townhouses, condominiums and duplexes at different prices, with a variety of options and amenities to all major customer segments: first-time, move-up and active adult. Pulte’s brand portfolio includes Centex, Pulte Homes,Del Webb, DiVosta Homes, John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods, and American West.The company operates in 810 active communities in 42 markets in 24 states across the United States in 2022. The homebuilding division is broken down into six reportable segments; Northeast, Southeast, Florida, Texas, Midwest and West.Pulte’s direct subsidiaries under the homebuilding segment include Pulte Diversified Companies Inc., Del Webb Corporation and Centex Corporation.Pulte’s Financial Services business includes mortgage banking and title operations through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. Pulte Mortgage arranges financing by originating mortgage loans for homebuyers.In first-quarter 2023, the company’s orders were 8,898 units, up from 8,767 homes in the prior- year quarter. Quarter-end backlog totaled 13,129 homes versus 19,935 units in the year ago quarter. Potential housing revenues from quarter-end backlog decreased 30.8% from the prior-year to $8 billion.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in PulteGroup a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $3,420.85, or a 242.09% gain, as of June 7, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 164.02% and the price of gold increased 36.81% over the same time frame in comparison.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for PHM.Shares of PulteGroup have outperformed its industry in the past three months. The company reported impressive first-quarter 2023 results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 32% and 9.4%, respectively. The company has been benefiting from robust land acquisition and operational strategic initiatives. PHM expects the land acquisition and development investment in 2023 to range within $3.5-$4 billion, up from the previously considered value of $3.3 billion. This is attributed to strong buyer demand and increase in its construction activities. Earnings estimates for 2023 have increased in the past 30 days. Although a challenging sales environment, higher cancellation rates, supply-chain issues, and significant inflation are dampening the performance, the improving interest rate environment is raising hope.Shares have gained 6.57% over the past four weeks and there have been 6 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower.

151,6b0395fc-6d30-304c-87ef-94ce0dc05621,JNJ,2023-06-08,Investors in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) have seen favorable returns of 48% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-johnson-johnson-nyse-jnj-110058119.html,1686222058,STORY,['JNJ'],"[When you buy and hold a stock for the long term, you definitely want it to provide a positive return. But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 29% over five years, which is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 11% in the last year.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Johnson &amp; Johnson achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 58% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 5% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Johnson &amp; Johnson's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Johnson &amp; Johnson the TSR over the last 5 years was 48%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveJohnson &amp; Johnson shareholders are down 8.1% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 3.9%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 8% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Shares of the company were up almost 3.2% on the news.The arbitration was related to two license agreements between the companies. In February 2022, Alkermes partially terminated its license agreement with Janssen in the United States.The final award confirms the tribunal's findings from the first and second interim awards that were issued on Dec 21, 2022, and Apr 19, 2023, respectively. It states that while Janssen has the right to terminate the license agreements, it cannot continue to sell products developed during the term of the agreements without paying royalties to Alkermes.The award also specifies the distinct royalty terms for each product covered by the agreements, including the termination dates. The royalties for INVEGA SUSTENNA will end on Aug 20, 2024, while the same for INVEGA TRINZA and INVEGA HAFYERA will extend until the second quarter of 2030 and May 2030, respectively. Additionally, royalties for CABENUVA in the United States will be payable until Dec 31, 2036.The aforementioned award confirms that Alkermes is entitled to back royalties and interest for the 2022 U.S. net sales of the long-acting INVEGA products and CABENUVA. These back royalties are expected to reach approximately $194 million (inclusive of interest) through Mar 15, 2023.

The company anticipates an increase of approximately $425 million in its financial outlook. This includes the back royalties from Janssen for 2022 and the expected royalty revenues from global net sales of INVEGA  and CABENUVA in 2023.Story continuesAlkermes' updated guidance for 2023 is based on the final award. The company now expects total revenues in the band of $1,550-$1,680 million compared with the previous guided range of $1,130-$1,250 million.INVEGA royalties are expected in the band of $265-$280 million compared with the previous projection of $40-$45 million. Royalties and interest are expected to be around $195 million. The company expects GAAP net income in the range of $225-$265 million, indicating a significant improvement from the previous anticipated loss of $160-$200 million.The updated guidance includes Alkermes' combined neuroscience and oncology business for the entire year, with the planned separation of the oncology business in the second half of 2023.Alkermes plc Price and Consensus Alkermes plc Price and ConsensusAlkermes plc price-consensus-chart | Alkermes plc QuoteZacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Alkermes carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the biotech sector are Akero Therapeutics AKRO and ADMA Biologics, Inc. ADMA, both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

The S&amp;P 500, which is on the verge of a bull market as well, has also benefitted from investor enthusiasm related to the technology. So, today, we’re going to look at the best stocks for an AI-powered market.Rather than chase stocks with sky-high valuations, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and C3.ai (NYSE:AI), the best AI stocks to buy for a bull market are top-notch names that the Street has not yet or just recently started to embrace.So, without further ado, here are the top stocks for an AI bull market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIntel (INTC)Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comWhile some chipmakers such as Nvidia have run up sharply on the promise of AI, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has largely been left behind. However, recent comments by Nvidia Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jensen Huang suggest that Intel may become a key Nvidia partner and benefit greatly from Nvidia’s prowess in AI.“We’re open to manufacturing with Intel… and we’ve recently received the test chip results of [Intel’s] next generation process, and the results look good,” Huang said.Intel is focused on expanding its manufacturing capacity. To this end, the company is building two chip factories in Arizona. In addition, the company began construction on a $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing site in Ohio in September.Meanwhile, as I’ve reported previously, the company’s Gaudi chips look poised to enable a great deal of generative AI, boosting revenue and profits from data centers over the long term.“We’re seeing a very positive response to Gaudi 2 and seeing our pipeline growing very rapidly for that product line,” said Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger on the company’s Q1 earnings call in April.Based on analysts’ average 2024 earnings estimate, INTC stock is trading at a price-earnings ratio of 17.8 compared with 38.4 for NVDA.Story continuesLemonade (LMND)Lemonade stock logo displayed on smartphone laying on top of computer keyboard.Source: Stephanie L Sanchez / Shutterstock.comLemonade (NASDAQ:LMND) is an insurance company that extensively utilizes AI to price its offerings and interact with its customers. In a recent letter to its shareholders, the insurer reported that it had identified “100 business processes that generative AI can automate and improve,” predicting these changes will significantly reduce its costs over the longer term.The company’s strategy of using AI to make itself more attractive to millennials appears to be paying off. In the first quarter, revenue soared an incredible 115% year over year to $95.2 million, while adjusted EBITDA saw an 11% improvement. In-force premiums increased 56% from a year ago to more than $653 million. And its customer count climbed 23% versus the same period a year earlier to 1.86 million.Finally, as Seeking Alpha’s Gary Alexander points out, the company is poised to benefit from interest rate increases and cross-selling opportunities.LMND stock is changing hands for a reasonable 2.7 times 2024 sales estimates.Medtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMedical device maker Medtronic (NASDAQ:MDT) is utilizing AI in multiple aspects of its business. For example, the company is using the technology to predict outcomes for spinal surgeries,  identify pre-cancerous tissue and determine the amount of insulin that diabetic patients require.And, as I’ve noted in previous columns, Medtronic has launched “a robot that helps perform surgeries” using artificial intelligence. Speaking to an analyst earlier this year, CFO Karen Parkhill said the robot is “going to be a strong contributor to our revenue growth for many years to come.”Investment bank Bernstein recently expressed optimism about Medtronic’s chances of reporting strong results next year, and it maintained an “outperform” rating on the stock.Shares currently trade with a forward price-earnings ratio of 15.4, but this discount may not last long.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of  INTC.

The sBLA is based on data from the KEYNOTE-966 trial, in which KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared to chemotherapy alone. Results from KEYNOTE-966 were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2023 Annual Meeting. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of February 7, 2024.""Most biliary tract cancers go undetected until an advanced stage, at which point many patients are ineligible for surgery and have few treatment options,"" said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""We look forward to working with the FDA to bring a new option to patients with advanced or unresectable biliary tract cancer that may help them live longer.""Merck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating KEYTRUDA in gastrointestinal cancers, which includes KEYNOTE-937 in earlier-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and in combination with LENVIMA® (lenvatinib, in collaboration with Eisai) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in the LEAP-012 study. Merck is continuing to study KEYTRUDA for multiple uses in hepatobiliary, esophageal, pancreatic, colorectal and gastric cancers.About KEYNOTE-966KEYNOTE-966 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04003636) evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin compared to placebo plus gemcitabine and cisplatin for the first-line treatment of advanced or unresectable BTC. The primary endpoint is OS, and the secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, objective response rate, duration of response and safety. The trial enrolled 1,069 patients who were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks for up to approximately two years) plus gemcitabine and cisplatin, or placebo plus gemcitabine and cisplatin.Story continuesAbout biliary tract cancerBiliary tract cancer is a group of rare and highly aggressive cancers in the gallbladder and bile ducts. Biliary tract cancer is the second most common type of primary liver cancer after HCC, accounting for approximately 15% of all liver cancers. It is estimated there are approximately 211,000 patients diagnosed with BTC and 174,000 patient deaths from the disease each year globally. In the U.S., there are about 20,000 patients diagnosed with BTC each year. Biliary tract cancer is most frequently diagnosed in patients between 50 to 70 years old, and approximately 70% of BTC patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Patients diagnosed with BTC face a very poor prognosis, with a five-year survival rate of 2% for those diagnosed with advanced disease and between 5% and 15% for those diagnosed across all stages.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Hepatocellular CarcinomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have been previously treated with sorafenib. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients.

Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both.

Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk.

LENVIMA inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4, the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, the combination of lenvatinib with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity compared to either treatment alone.LENVIMA® (lenvatinib) Indications in the U.S.For the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)In combination with pembrolizumab, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC)In combination with everolimus, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior anti-angiogenic therapyFor the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)In combination with pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma (EC) that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR), as determined by an FDA-approved test, or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.Selected Safety Information for LENVIMAWarnings and PrecautionsHypertension.

Across clinical studies of 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms.Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level ≤0.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level &gt;0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients in RCC.Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice.Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ). ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease, or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ.Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA.Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ.Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgment of adequate resolution.Embryo‐Fetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for at least 30 days after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn DTC, the most common adverse reactions (≥30%) observed in LENVIMA-treated patients were hypertension (73%), fatigue (67%), diarrhea (67%), arthralgia/myalgia (62%), decreased appetite (54%), decreased weight (51%), nausea (47%), stomatitis (41%), headache (38%), vomiting (36%), proteinuria (34%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (32%), abdominal pain (31%), and dysphonia (31%).

157,1ad4e644-647c-323a-921a-e0e69e7a6ee2,BA,2023-06-08,Returns On Capital At Boeing (NYSE:BA) Paint A Concerning Picture,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-boeing-nyse-ba-110032752.html,1686222032,STORY,['BA'],"[When it comes to investing, there are some useful financial metrics that can warn us when a business is potentially in trouble. More often than not, we'll see a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining amount of capital employed. Ultimately this means that the company is earning less per dollar invested and on top of that, it's shrinking its base of capital employed. So after we looked into Boeing (NYSE:BA), the trends above didn't look too great.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Boeing, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.0022 = US$95m ÷ (US$136b - US$94b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Boeing has an ROCE of 0.2%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 9.9%. View our latest analysis for Boeing roceIn the above chart we have measured Boeing's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Boeing here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?There is reason to be cautious about Boeing, given the returns are trending downwards. To be more specific, the ROCE was 28% five years ago, but since then it has dropped noticeably. And on the capital employed front, the business is utilizing roughly the same amount of capital as it was back then. Companies that exhibit these attributes tend to not be shrinking, but they can be mature and facing pressure on their margins from competition. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on Boeing becoming one if things continue as they have.Story continuesOn a side note, Boeing's current liabilities are still rather high at 69% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.Our Take On Boeing's ROCEIn summary, it's unfortunate that Boeing is generating lower returns from the same amount of capital. Investors haven't taken kindly to these developments, since the stock has declined 39% from where it was five years ago. That being the case, unless the underlying trends revert to a more positive trajectory, we'd consider looking elsewhere.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Boeing that you might find interesting.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

ETFs in Focus,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tough-time-boeing-near-term-171500116.html,1686158100,STORY,['BA'],"[Recently, Boeing alerted the public to a new flaw in its 787 Dreamliner planes, which is expected to postpone the delivery of these large-bodied aircraft. This announcement is another bump in the road for the aircraft manufacturer that has been plagued by multiple production issues recently.The latest hiccup involves an abnormal condition associated with a fitting on the horizontal stabilizer of the 787s. Despite this, the problem is not related to flight safety, and existing aircraft can continue to operate. However, this issue is expected to delay the near-term deliveries by roughly two weeks.Previously this year, Boeing was forced to suspend deliveries of the same aircraft due to a defect in a fuselage component of specific 787s. Moreover, the company had to make adjustments to some of its top-selling 737 Max planes because of an issue with fittings in some planes' aft fuselages, produced by Spirit Aerosystems.Nevertheless, Boeing maintains that this new setback will not alter its yearly delivery forecast for the Dreamliner aircraft. The company remains hopeful about delivering between 70 and 80 of these planes this year. Boeing's shares lost 0.7% on Jun 6. The stock also lost 0.3% after hours. Repercussions for ETFsThis is a crucial time for investors who indirectly hold Boeing stock through ETFs to remain vigilant.

But finding a market for a giant and costly rocket promises to be difficult, with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) - seen as a potential customer - signaling little interest.""It's a capability right now that we, the DoD, don't need,"" Colonel Douglas Pentecost, a senior rocket acquisition official with the U.S. military's Space Force, said in an interview. ""We have the capability that we need at the affordability price that we have, so we're not that interested in some partnership with NASA on the SLS system.""As a commercial venture, the SLS could face other challenges including competition from cheaper and reusable rockets such as Starship from Elon Musk's SpaceX and New Glenn from fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin. The SLS is not reusable.The SLS is an impressive sight, resembling an immense dart as it towers as tall as a 32-story building on the launch pad. But it has only ever served NASA. Its first and only use so far was last November when it was successfully launched from Florida as part of NASA's Artemis program that aims to return astronauts to the surface of the moon as early as 2025.NASA's SLS vision has its skeptics.""I don't see the cost going down at this point to be competitive, just given the history and how challenging of a rocket it is to build,"" said Cristina Chaplain, former assistant director of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the investigative arm of the U.S. Congress.Story continues""Even when they stabilize production, I don't see them having quite the factory line that you need to get for that kind of thing,"" added Chaplain, who led GAO audits of SLS.A lack of SLS launch dates amid a backlog of Artemis program missions in the coming years is another roadblock, even if there is demand for the rocket beyond NASA, Chaplain said.NASA currently manages SLS production, with Boeing and Northrop its top contractors, each having contracts under which the space agency bears any delay costs. Boeing and Northrop executives have declined to discuss plans for cutting SLS costs under the proposed commercial contract. Boeing said the potential deal was still being negotiated with NASA.'A MAP TO GET HERE'The aim would be for the two companies to sell the rocket to other customers for the first time, after its decade in development and successful 2022 debut, NASA officials said. That would let NASA free up its budget and staff for other programs under Artemis.""If they can sell it, they (Boeing and Northrop) get more flow through the factory, that drives down our recurring engineering cost,"" Jim Free, head of NASA's space exploration wing overseeing the Artemis program, said in an interview. ""We've thought of a map to get there, we need them to engage, to agree with that map.""NASA officials said a key part of the plan is finding new customers, which could include the Pentagon or commercial players.The Space Force's Pentecost said Boeing has been in talks with U.S. defense officials to explore offering SLS in the Pentagon's Phase 3 National Security Space Launch competition - a procurement program expected to buy billions of dollars in launches from multiple companies. While the SLS meets Pentagon requirements, its slow production rate ""probably doesn't,"" Pentecost added.Boeing has said SLS would work well for that program, but told Reuters that the company is ""not actively pursuing"" it at this time.NASA officials have acknowledged that squeezing the roughly $23 billion SLS program, its vast supplier network and a workforce of thousands of agency and contractor employees into a cheaper and privately managed contract will not be easy. Boeing has said the SLS program has created 28,000 jobs.NASA wants one SLS rocket produced annually for Artemis and plans to buy four SLS launches from Deep Space Transport, the Boeing-Northrup joint venture, after the fifth mission. The deal includes an option to buy five more launches.Convincing about 400 suppliers across 46 U.S. states, already struggling with rising labor costs, to increase production and staffing would be another issue, according to Amit Kshatriya, the head of NASA's new Moon to Mars office, formed in March to manage the agency's Artemis and SLS strategy.Even if Boeing and Northrup do not achieve NASA's cost-cutting goals, the agency still plans to pressure them on reducing costs, Kshatriya said.""We can't just wait and hope that all these answers come as a part of this one procurement,"" Kshatriya added.(Reporting by Joey Roulette; Editing by Will Dunham and Ben Klayman)]"

This, along with the latest contract win, boosts sales expectations for the abovementioned segment.LMT expects to deliver 147-153 jets per year in 2023 and 2024, and 156 jets in 2025 and beyond. This should bolster the company’s revenues from the military aircraft field.Growth ProspectsPer Mordor Intelligence projections, the global military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2031.

Usually, social commentary fades after 48 hours. However, Bud Light experienced an unexpected escalation of customer rage, amplified by influential media, resulting in a boycott that has defied all expectations and is now entering an unprecedented third month.The first rule of crisis management: Stop the bleedingNationwide, Bud Light sales have shrunk by more than 25% versus a year ago during the week ended May 20. Sales of other Anheuser-Busch brands also dropped: Budweiser -11.2%; Michelob Ultra -6.5% and Natural Light -4.9% for the same period.“We've never seen such a dramatic shift in national share in such a short period of time,” Beer Business Daily commented.“I’m stunned by how widespread the impact has been felt,” said Beer Marketer’s insights editor Benj Steinman. “It tells you that the hit is not just red and rural.”Anheuser-Busch stock fell 18% from Apr. 1 to Jun. 2, losing more than 23 billion in market capitalization due to the crisis, while the S&amp;P500 was up 3.8 % for the same period. The Anheuser-Busch position is particularly perilous now as the crucial summer selling season begins.In what could turn out to be a new major challenge, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced this week that Anheuser-Busch agreed to pay $537,000 to settle allegations it failed to comply with chemical accident prevention regulations and will improve safety operations at 11 of its flagship breweries that use anhydrous ammonia, which is dangerous to the skin, eyes, and lungs.‘The difference between mere management and leadership is communication’ –Winston ChurchillThe digital world has become omnipresent. Yet, many corporate cultures, boards, executives, and advisors have not adapted to the immediate nature of its impact.Evidently, corporate leaders have not learned about the speed and magnitude of social media from the Silicon Valley Bank disaster, the modern-day bank run that was accelerated by instant digital commentary. In a single day, customers withdrew $42 billion.Story continuesWhile these disasters are not equivalent, in the middle of a crisis, Anheuser-Busch seemed to have little understanding of the internet’s instant influence, probably due to executive hubris and minimal communication with customers.CEOs and boards must fully embrace their company’s public stance. They must exude authority, accountability, leadership, and confidence as they guide the company's public image with unwavering resolve.Instead, Bud Light issued an ineffective statement four days after the blowback from the campaign began. And it took Anheuser-Busch CEO Brendan Whitworth almost two weeks to issue an indecisive apology.Part of the fury was undoubtedly triggered by management's failure to take ownership of the campaign–or alternatively, address customer concerns over the sponsorship.‘If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle’ –Sun TzuSince March, no matter which CEO or board I speak with about crisis or reputation, the Bud Light disaster monopolizes the discussion.What insights did other CEOs gain from this prolonged Bud Light uproar? Apparently, not much. Brands like Maybelline and Target have faced a similar backlash on social media.It was utterly surprising that Target CEO Brian Cornell took a somewhat analogous approach to Bud Light during the ongoing crisis. Target stock was down 15% and lost more than $11 billion in market capitalization from May 1 to June 2, slipping to the lowest level since 2020, while the S&amp;P was up 3% for the same period. It’s almost a living case study of what not to do.In highly polarized times, no matter the cultural or political issue, broadly, 45% support you, 45% are against you, and about 10% are undecided. The harshness and pushback depend on the gravity of the subject, how poorly or soundly the company manages the crisis, and how undecided lean.So, why would any CEO take action to instantly alienate half of their customers, employees, investors, and other constituents?It is not that companies should be quiet on issues, but as my dad always said,” Understand all the circumstances, players, timing, and dynamics–then pick your fights.”Nike has a history of taking a stand on social issues. In 2018, Nike took a risk. However, they understood their customer base, largely millennials and Gen Zers who want brands to be vocal on social issues.Nike's ""Dream Crazy"" ads featured Colin Kaepernick, former NFL quarterback turned civil rights activist. While Nike managed the aftermath quite well, experiencing increased sneaker sales, the campaign's success is also attributed to the inclusion of LeBron James, Serena Williams, and Shaquem Griffin.However, when later the company contradicted its messaging, it resulted in negative commentary. In May 2019, six-time Olympic gold medal sprinter Allyson Felix, criticized Nike for its treatment of pregnant female athletes. Nike changed its policy after Felix's comments went viral and ensured that pregnancy would not result in financial penalties for female athletes.Good news happens over time. Bad news is instant and overwhelmingTo avoid brand devastation, top executives must keep oversight of brand and social content. When faced with a thorny issue, they must listen to all sides of the argument. Campaigns must be reviewed by non-conflicted public relations professionals who can foresee possible news coverage and how the campaign will be received by customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders. It’s also paramount to be well-informed on opposition groups and the actions they could potentially take.Nineteenth-century circus impresario P.T. Barnum, who said “There is no such thing as bad publicity,” was wrong–or at least his theory did not stand the test of time.

By utilizing ANSYS' computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and high-performance computing technology, Lufthansa Technik and BASF have designed a coating film with a ribbed texture similar to the placoid scales on shark skin, known as riblets.These riblets lessen drag and friction while increasing buoyancy for sharks. As a result, the coating inspired by these riblets is expected to lower aircraft drag and friction, reduce fuel consumption for airplanes and boost sustainable aviation.ANSYS' CFD capabilities helped engineers to analyze the turbulent flow around the riblets to ensure they would generate the desired effect, added the company. Lufthansa Technik utilized ANSYS' tools to build and validate virtual prototypes of AeroSHARK, allowing them to perform comprehensive aerodynamic simulations and minimize the need for physical flight tests. This approach significantly reduced the risk and time required for certification.ANSYS, Inc. Price and ConsensusANSYS, Inc. Price and ConsensusANSYS, Inc. price-consensus-chart | ANSYS, Inc. QuoteAeroSHARK has received certification from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the American Federal Aviation Authority for specific Boeing 777 aircraft models. Currently, Swiss International Air Lines and Lufthansa Cargo are operating AeroSHARK on some of their Boeing 777s, added the company.Overall, the collaboration is aimed at enhancing AeroSHARK's ability to improve sustainability in air transport and promote a more sustainable future for commercial aircraft. Currently, AeroSHARK can cover 40% of an aircraft surface, but Lufthansa Technik plans to expand its coverage to other areas of the plane based on the success of simulation-powered testing.ANSS develops and globally markets engineering simulation software and services widely used by engineers, designers, researchers and students across a broad spectrum of industries and academia.Story continuesThe company announced that it plans to reduce its carbon footprint by 15% by minimizing materials waste and physical prototyping. The company plans to reach its target by 2027.On Oct 19, 2022, ANSYS announced that its simulation solutions are being leveraged by ZeroAvia for the development of its sustainable hydrogen-electric powertrain, which is aimed at reducing aviation emissions to tackle climate change. According to ZeroAvia, the company’s powertrain will help reduce operating expenses and tackle climate change as hydrogen-electric propulsion technology emits 90% less lifecycle emissions as compared to jet fuel-based turbines.Prior to that, the company announced that its simulation solutions are being leveraged by a NASA-backed program to accelerate aviation sustainability. The collaboration is aimed at using liquid ammonia to develop zero-carbon jet engines.ANSS currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Michael Liersch, Wells Fargo Head of Advice and Planning, discusses the reasonings behind the study's findings.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]DIANE KING HALL: Inheriting the family business, it can be a badge of honor or a financial burden. A new Wells Fargo study found that 52% of business owners do not want their children to run their business.For more, we're joined by Michael Liersch, Wells Fargo Head of Advice and Planning. So Michael, let's get right into this survey. So I was a little bit surprised, not completely surprised by this. What stood out to you?MICHAEL LIERSCH: Well, what stood out to me, and maybe this is where you're particularly surprised too, is that not only did business owners say they weren't necessarily wanting or expecting their next gen, generation to help take over the business, but in fact, a large proportion 44% were worried that their children didn't know how to build and protect wealth.So it wasn't only just the idea of taking over the business, but also did they have the knowledge, the ability, the capabilities to really, really understand finances, really understand how a business works. So there was a lot of interesting findings along those lines.DIANE KING HALL: So Michael, I got to ask, have you watched any ""Succession""? I know it's awesome but--MICHAEL LIERSCH: I don't watch it. I don't watch ""Succession"" personally. But a lot of our customers and clients do. And they have a lot of thoughts about it. And I think the thoughts about it seem to rhyme a bit with I think where you're going with this. So what are your thoughts on ""Succession""?DIANE KING HALL: I was going to say, it feels a little bit like life imitating art. I didn't watch all of the episodes of ""Succession"", but I watched enough to know that there was really this battle for carrying on the legacy. And, you know, the children were vying for that, but it was tough to hand over. You know, so that kind of plays out in some of the numbers that you're talking about with us.Story continuesBut where were these families willing to kind of help, you know, their next generation?MICHAEL LIERSCH: So the very positive part about all of this-- so moving on from TV programs that maybe sensationalize a bit of these dynamics-- is that actually a vast majority of the wealth creators that we surveyed, said that they wanted to enable their children to carve their own path in life. So over 90% said that.And that they were willing to really invest in those ideas. So things like education, you know, came out at the top. Things like helping their children become homeowners, and also invest in a way that would be productive, came out as top. So they're willing to help their children build those skills.The idea is that they were just concerned that maybe in the face of having wealth or in the face of having the opportunity to run a business, they might not build those skills by a matter of necessity. So they realized they had designed those experiences for their children if that makes sense.DIANE KING HALL: So I got to ask you, Michael, in that context. I've seen data before. I don't remember the exact source, but where the next generation, they followed kind of this formula. The previous generation did not pass on the family business.And the next generation basically kind of squandered the wealth and then that leads the following generation to have to rebuild and start all over. Was there any conversation around that and kind of the fallout of not passing on the family business?MICHAEL LIERSCH: Absolutely, so that's called the shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves phenomenon. And it exists across the world. So the idea here is that 70% of the time by the next generation, all the wealth is lost or dissipates. And by the third generation, 90% of the wealth is lost or dissipates. And that was a key concern of about 44% of the respondents that that would happen.And so what was interesting, though, is that they acknowledge then that the focus should be on the values. What are the values related to money? And 3/4 of the participants said they were very focused on sharing financial values and passing those along. And they felt they had done a good job.The one watch item that they had, and especially Gen Xers that they had, for themselves, is that even though they're transferring those values, sometimes they like to help a bit too much, soothe in, smooth situations, help support, or get kids out of trouble when they probably should learn their own lessons.And the respondents acknowledged, especially Gen Xers or people born, let's say, in the '70s, knew they were doing those things and that may actually make kids less able to make it on their own and they needed to work harder on that.DIANE KING HALL: That's an interesting point because as a parent myself, I can certainly understand the desire to help because you dont-- you know, you don't want to just leave your kid completely out there. But I guess there's a way to do it without leaving them hanging.MICHAEL LIERSCH: Exactly, you want to create that resilience. And so how do you do that? The response is acknowledged. The number one thing is through hard work. The second thing is through education. And the third is really through this idea of just working through a lot of different cycles.And in a land of opportunity-- so they acknowledged living in the United States, for example-- is a huge plus. And then what's interesting is, they said and there's a bit of luck involved in all of it too. So that hard work, living in the US as a business owner, and that education, pepper in a little bit of luck, and then that's what makes someone successful. And that's what they want to pass along to their children.DIANE KING HALL: All right. We will have to leave it there. Michael Liersch, Wells Fargo Head of Advice and Planning Thank. You so much for joining us today.MICHAEL LIERSCH: Thank you so much.DIANE KING HALL: All right.]"

Financials were the day’s top-performing sector, with S&amp;P 500 Financials rising 1.3%.Likewise, the KBW Regional Banking Index almost hit a seven-week high to jump 5.4%. Further, the S&amp;P Banks Select Industry Index was up 4.4%.Talking about individual stocks, big names, including Bank of America BAC, Citigroup C, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo WFC, rose between 1.5% and 3%. Regional lenders like PacWest Bancorp, Western Alliance, Zions Bancorp, Comerica CMA, Truist Financial and KeyCorp KEY performed even better, increasing between 4% and 8.5%.The primary reason for bullish investor sentiments toward regional banks seems to be an expected pause in interest rate hikes. The Federal Reserve officials will be holding a two-day FOMC meeting later this month, and market participants are forecasting no change in rates this time.Per the CME FedWatch tool, currently, there is nearly an 80% chance that the central bank will keep interest rates unchanged. Since last year, the Fed has been ultra-aggressive in raising interest rates to curb ‘sticky’ inflation. At present, the Fed fund rates stand in the range of 5-5.25% (the highest level in 15 years).While banks are known to benefit from higher rates, this time it has turned out to be a bane. Faster rate hikes have placed banks in a disadvantageous situation. The loan demand is gradually waning, and funding costs are increasing. This has put pressure on banks’ net interest margin (NIM).Though banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Comerica and Truist Financial witnessed expansion in NIM on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter, they are now projecting not much further expansion in the metric in the coming period. Hence, banks’ net interest income (a major revenue source) is also now expected to rise modestly.Further, the faster rate hike triggered a regional banking crisis and was the primary reason for the collapse and failure of three major regional banks since March 2023. A host of issues, including potential recession, slowing loan demand, rising funding costs and a high level of fixed-rate mortgage and commercial real estate loans, as well as uninsured deposits in the balance sheet, made the situation difficult for regional banks.Huge exposure to uninsured deposits and asset-liability mismatches are bigger concerns for several banks, including Comerica and KeyCorp. The banks witnessed heavy deposit outflows following the collapse of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank in March.Nonetheless, the situation has stabilized since then, and investor stance is turning optimistic toward regional bank stocks. However, strong inflation reading and a tight job market indicating that the economy remains solid are likely to lead the Fed to keep options open about future interest rate hikes.At present, BAC, C, WFC, CMA and KEY each carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This violates the Fifth Amendment, which states that the government has to pay ‘just compensation’ when it takes private property for public use.The company also claims that the government is forcing drugmakers to convey that they agree to the price set by the government. In case they do not agree, they will be forced to pay higher taxes and monetary penalties. This violates the First Amendment's protections of free speech.The lawsuit, which was filed in the district court at Columbia, claims that the negotiation program is a ‘sham’ as it neither involves genuine ‘negotiation’ nor real agreements. Merck also called the whole situation a way to ‘legitimize government extortion’.Merck expects that its flagship medications, namely cancer drug Keytruda and diabetes drugs, Janumet and Januvia, are likely to be included in the government’s price negotiation plan in the next few years. Per an Bloomberg article, the negotiations for just Keytruda will trim 5% from the company's revenues in the first year of bargaining.In the year so far, shares of Merck have dropped 0.9% against the industry‘s 0.3% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the last year, the IRA allows Medicare to negotiate prices for a certain number of branded drugs. Per the Biden administration, Americans pay more for prescription medicines than any other country. The government is initiating such reforms to curb soaring drug prices and make them more affordable to the general public.This lawsuit by Merck against the government could be one of the first but probably not the last as spokespersons for several large drugmakers have voiced against the government program.Story continuesLast month, Pfizer’s PFE chief executive officer (CEO) Albert Bourla called the program ""negotiation with a gun to your head"". In an interview with Reuters, the Pfizer CEO stated that negotiation is in fact a ‘price setting’. The Pfizer CEO also stated that he expects drugmakers to file lawsuits in an attempt to halt the government’s drug price plan.In February, Novartis NVS CEO Vas Narasimhan also echoed similar words as Bourla. During one of Novartis’ conference calls, Narasimhan informed stakeholders that implementation of the negotiation program will put burden on a drugmaker’s research and development for new drugs, which generally take ample time and resources until the final product reaches the general population.Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

GSK expects to launch Arexvy in Europe ahead of the 2023 RSV season, which typically starts in autumn.The approval of the RSV vaccine is based on data from the positive pivotal AReSVi-006 phase III study in which the vaccine led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall efficacy of 82.6%.Arexvy was approved by the FDA for older adults in May. This was the first RSV vaccine for older adults to be approved anywhere in the world. GSK’s RSV vaccine is under review in Japan and some other countries.GSK’s stock has declined 1.5% this year so far compared with a decline of 7.3% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPfizer’s PFE RSV vaccine, Abrysvo, was also approved by the FDA in late May for older adults, being the second RSV vaccine to be approved for this age group in the United States.Older adults, young infants and people with some chronic medical conditions are at maximum risk to get lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)-RSV disease. The approval of Abrysvo and Arexvy is expected to provide protection to older adults in the anticipated RSV season this fall. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is expected to have a meeting on Jun 21 to give its recommendation for the proper use of RSV vaccines in older adults.AstraZeneca AZN and Sanofi’s SNY RSV vaccine called Beyfortus/nirsevimab was approved in Europe for protection against LRTI caused by RSV in newborns and infants in November 2022. A similar application is under review in the United States, with an FDA decision expected in the third quarter of this year.  The approval for Beyfortus was based on data from the MELODY phase III and other phase IIb studies conducted jointly by AstraZeneca and Sanofi.Story continuesPfizer has also developed an RSV vaccine for infants through maternal immunization. The vaccine candidate is under FDA review for preventing medically attended lower respiratory tract disease (MA-LRTD) and severe MA-LRTD caused by RSV in infants from birth up to six months of age by active immunization of pregnant individuals. A decision from the FDA is expected in August.Moderna is also developing an mRNA vaccine, mRNA-1345, targeting RSV in a phase III study, ConquerRSV, in older adults. The study met the primary efficacy endpoints, per top-line data announced in January. Based on these results, Moderna expects to file for regulatory approval. The company is also evaluating mRNA-1345 in an early-stage study in pediatric populations.In a separate press release, GSK announced that the FDA has accepted its supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) seeking expanded approval for Jemperli (dostarlimab) for primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.The sBLA seeks approval of Jemperli in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. The regulatory application seeking approval for Jemperli was based on pivotal data from Part 1 of the RUBY phase III study. The FDA granted priority review to the sBLA with a decision expected on Sep 23.In endometrial cancer, Jemperli is currently approved to treat adult patients with dMMR recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer that has progressed on or following a prior platinum-containing regimen. If the potential new indication is approved, Jemperli can be prescribed earlier in treatment in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy for patients with dMMR/MSI-H primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.A similar application seeking expanded use of Jemperli in endometrial cancer is also under review in the EU.Zacks RankGSK currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The technology is already available on Amazon.com and the Amazon mobile app.Affirm shares soared as much as 20% on the news during Wednesday's trading session.Buy-now-pay-later has been an increasingly competitive space with the likes of Block (SQ) and Klarna competing with Affirm, PayPal (PYPL), and Apple (AAPL). For its part, Affirm has been dealing with right sizing amid the increasingly competitive landscape. The payment platform cut 19% of its workforce in February and recently saw shares trade-off after losses continued to pile up in its most recent earnings report. ""Although currently difficult to quantify, we contend integration of Adaptive Checkout into Amazon's digital wallet will boost visibility, merchant and consumer adoption,"" Truist analyst Andrew Jeffrey wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. ""Apple maintains significant competitive advantage, in our view, owing to its native iPhone integration, but Amazon's leading eCommerce share and growing digital wallet push are integral to Affirm's eCommerce growth.""As Jeffery points out, Apple's push into buy-now-pay later has weighed on shares of Affirm and another popular payment play, PayPal. Affirm stock had been down about 35% over the last year, and down about 80% since its January 2021 initial public offering.At the JPMorgan Global Technology Media &amp; Communications Conference on May 23, Affirm CEO Max Levchin argued that the addition of Apple in the space could be a positive because it means BNPL is here to stay.He said that ""if Apple took up, I don't know how many thousands of engineers had to work on this, but it's unlikely it would disappear. Apple does not do things as a flash in a pan modality.""Story continuesMax Levchin, Founder &amp; CEO of Affirm, Inc., arrives at the Sun Valley Resort for the Allen &amp; Company Sun Valley Conference on July 05, 2022, in Sun Valley, Idaho.

In Wednesday's release Affirm president Libor Michalek projected digital wallets will increase to more than half of worldwide e-commerce transactions by 2025.Wednesday's announcement is an extension of a partnership with Amazon that stems back to 2021. Affirm also partners with the likes of Shopify (SHOP), Walmart (WMT), and Target (TGT), among others.The product it's adding to Amazon Pay, Adaptive Checkout, allows customers to adapt their payment plan to their needs.

(PYPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-inc-pypl-trending-130011206.html,1686142811,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Paypal (PYPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned -1.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Paypal falls in, has gained 15.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.16 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +24.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +19.9%. This estimate has changed +1.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.71 indicates a change of +15.3% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PYPL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.26 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.54 billion and $32.12 billion estimates indicate +7.3% and +8.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $7.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.6%. EPS of $1.17 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.69%. The EPS surprise was +6.36%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

From earnings upgrades to technical chart patterns, and secular macroeconomic tailwinds, each of these stocks has a few things going for them.Additionally, they represent a diverse selection of market sectors offering a broad range of options for investors to select from.Molson CoorsMolson Coors is a globally recognized brewing company that boasts a rich history spanning over two centuries. Known for its portfolio of iconic beer brands, including Coors, Miller, Blue Moon, and Molson Canadian, the company has a strong presence in North America, Europe, and other international markets.TAP operates through various subsidiaries and joint ventures, enabling it to tap into diverse markets and consumer preferences. With a commitment to brewing excellence, innovation, and sustainability, the company continues to introduce new and exciting products to meet evolving consumer demands.Tap just broke above a major level of resistance that has been holding it down for the last four years. Additionally, after pushing above the $60 level of resistance, it traded back down retesting the level and pushed higher again. This indicates that resistance has turned to support and is a very bullish development.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewMolson Coors currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 11.7% and are expected to grow 20% YoY. FY23 earnings have been upgraded by 7.6% and are projected to climb 7.3% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTAP is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 15x, which is below the market average, and just above its 25-year median of 14x. Additionally, Molson Coors stock has a dividend yield of 2.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchJP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. is one of the largest and most renowned banking institutions in the world, with a history that spans over two centuries. As a global leader in financial services, JPM offers a comprehensive range of banking, investment, and asset management services to individuals, businesses, and institutional clients.JPM’s diverse business portfolio includes consumer banking, commercial banking, investment banking, and wealth management, among other areas. With a strong presence in both domestic and international markets, JPM leverages its extensive network to provide innovative financial solutions.After surviving, and even benefiting from the recent turmoil in regional banking sector JPM is building a very bullish technical chart pattern. Considering JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. absorbed in billions of new deposits and purchased a large debt portfolio at a discount following the banking debacle, it’s no wonder investors are interested in buying stock in the financial behemoth.JPM stock has cleared two major levels of resistance and has constructed a tight consolidation. If the stock can clear the $141 level, it should go on a nice bull run. Alternatively, if the price trades below $137.50 investors can expect the stock to trade back down into the range.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewJP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. has seen some substantial upgrades in its earnings estimates, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Analysts seem emboldened by JPM’s resolute actions during the banking crisis and have boosted expectations accordingly.Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 6.6% and FY23 earnings have been upgraded by 11.5%. If JPM can reach expectations it would reflect a 28.6% YoY increase in current quarter earnings, and an 18.2% YoY increase in FY23 earnings. Additionally, current quarter sales are projected to climb 20%, while FY23 sales are projected to grow 14.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMurphy USAMurphy USA MUSA is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States. Murphy USA markets refined products through a chain of retail stations, almost all of which are located near a Walmart supercenter, primarily in the Southeast, Southwest and Midwest United States. As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had more than 1,700 retail fuel stations encompassing 27 states.The company, which caters to approximately 1.6 million customers daily, also owns a dedicated line space on the Colonial Pipeline - the largest refined products system in the country and the biggest gasoline mover.MUSA has been an incredibly strong stock over the last five years, considerably outperforming the industry and broad market. That performance is likely to keep up over the next few years as the energy market could remain supply constrained going forward.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchJust this week OPEC+ announced that they would be cutting daily oil output by 1 million barrels per day, lighting a fire under oil prices. Additionally, the gross underinvestment in oil and gas infrastructure over the last decade caused by ESG initiatives, has limited oil and gas infrastructure investments tremendously. Investments in new oil projects take 3-5 years before yielding considerable production, so supply is likely to stay tight for some time.Murphy USA is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 14.7x, which is below the market average of 20x, and below its five-year median of 16x. Considering how much MUSA stock has appreciated over that period it is extremely impressive it has maintained such a reasonable valuation.This is because of the explosion in earnings MUSA experienced between 2019 and today, where annual EPS grew from $5.26 to $26.82 per share. And if oil prices remain elevated investors can expect those profits to remain high as well.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineBy utilizing the Zacks Rank #1 List, investors can find new stocks with strong near-term expectations daily.

GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with MU. Click here to check it out.

According to the 10-K for 2022, Waters has provided high-value analytical technologies and industry leading scientific expertise, with solutions that serve life, materials and food sciences.More specifically, it designs, manufactures and sells tools for liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis. However, it has a relatively diverse set of revenue generators within its niche.Waters: A Solid Medical Devices CompanyThe original company was formed by Jim Waters in 1958. Organically and through acquisitions, it has grown into a $15.26 billion company, with 2022 revenue of $2.97 billion.One starting point for examining the strength of its fundamentals would be its margins. They have been relatively high and consistent, with one exception in 2018.Waters: A Solid Medical Devices CompanyThose margins also support net income and help provide funding for share repurchases. Combining higher net income and fewer shares leads to greater earnings per share.Waters: A Solid Medical Devices CompanyHigh levels of profitability should also generate free cash flow, which can then be invested for more growth in the future. Unfortunately, FCF has fallen in four of the past five years.Waters: A Solid Medical Devices CompanyWaters' annual filing for 2022 had an explanation for the pullback: The Company generated $612 million, $747 million and $791 million of net cash flows provided by operating activities in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in 2022 operating cash flow was primarily a result of higher inventory levels, slower cash collections and higher incentive compensation payments in 2022 compared to 2021.Story continuesThe filing for 2021 provided this information for that year: The decrease in operating cash flow in 2021 was primarily a result of the $100 million of 2020 cost actions and working capital improvements implemented being reinstated once customer demand increased.So it does not seem that the slower cash flow is the result of some deep-seated problem; instead, it is more like the meat and potatoes of running a business in turbulent times.Theoretically, that still leaves a hefty amount of cash available for organic growth, since it does not pay a dividend. However, Waters board of directors had other ideas. It noted, During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company repurchased $616 million and $640 million of the Companys outstanding common stock, respectively, under authorized share repurchase programs.From a financial strength perspective, it carries a modest debt load. That produces a comfortable interest coverage ratio of 16.33 and a high Altman Z-Score of 9.26.What is most striking about its financial metrics is the return on invested capital versus the weighted average cost of capital relationship. Waters is clearly a value creator:Waters: A Solid Medical Devices CompanyFor 2022, the WACC was 8.77% and the ROIC was 30.19%.Its growth rates are not particularly high, but they are sufficient for most investors. Over the past three years, revenue grew by an average of 11.70% per year, Ebitda increased by an average of 11.40% and earnings per share without NRI averaged growth of 10.50% per year.The company has been able to grow both its revenue and Ebitda quite consistently. That has resulted in a high predictability ranking of 4.5 out of five stars.As noted, Waters has aggressively bought back its own shares, and over the past 10 years that has worked out to an average of just under 3% per year. Thats good for shareholdersand makes it easier for management to grow earnings per share.Turning to valuation, the GF Value Line considers the company to be modestly undervalued. It sees an intrinsic value of $352.77, while the closing price on May 24 was $256.99. That is a $95.78 difference, or a 37% margin of safety.Waters: A Solid Medical Devices CompanyWaters has a price-earnings multiple of 22.33, which is very close to the industry median of 23.10. The PEG ratio, based on a five-year Ebitda growth rate of 11.50% per year, works out to 1.94. Thats near the top end of the fair valuation range.The discounted cash flow calculator comes to a bearish conclusion. Based on an initial growth rate of 9.20%, which is the 10-year average for earnings per share without NRI, it puts the fair value at $190.21. Thats $66.78 below the current price, and indicates a negative margin of safety of 35.11%.If we put a trendline on a 10-year chart, we end up with a price that is very close to the GF Value price:Waters: A Solid Medical Devices CompanyPotential investors will need to pick the optimistic, pessimistic or current value option when they assess the company.Eight of the guru investors added to or set up new Waters holdings in the first quarter of this year. One reduced its holding and two others made no changes, according to 13F filings.The top three investors as of March 31 were the Vanguard Health Care Fund (Trades, Portfolio) (811,122 shares), PRIMECAP Management (Trades, Portfolio) (77,844 shares) and Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio) with 55,543 shares.Institutional investors have a solid position in the company, holding 69.03% of the shares outstanding. Insiders accounted for another 4.94%. The largest single shareholder among the insiders is Edward Conrad, a former director, who held 74,542 shares at the end of March. Dr. Udit Batra, the president and CEO, has a relatively small investment of 8,523 shares.Investors should be aware 13F filings do not give a complete picture of a firms holdings as the reports only include its positions in U.S. stocks and American depository receipts, but they can still provide valuable information. Further, the reports only reflect trades and holdings as of the most-recent portfolio filing date, which may or may not be held by the reporting firm today or even when this article was published.In conclusion, Waters is a solid company with a fair to depressed share price (I'm an optimist). It is a reasonable candidate for investors who want capital gains, especially when the size of the gains may be helped along by share repurchases.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Through this pilot, the companies will gather data using Dynamic Line Ratings (DLR) to evaluate how LineVision can optimally integrate power from renewable energy sources. The study is being launched this month and will conclude before the end of the year.AES LogoThe project will leverage LineVision's industry leading DLR for a proposed deployment at an AES utility based on a system study to determine locations best suited for the most beneficial impact to the system and customers.""There are several exciting technologies that can be used to enhance the capacity of our grid,"" said Kristina Lund, President, AES Utilities. ""AES looks to lead the industry in deploying advanced technologies, like DLR, that allow us to deliver safe, reliable, and affordable energy to our customers as the demands for increasingly green energy and electrified communities grow.""The advantage of deploying this technology is timely. According to a Princeton University study, the US will need to more than double the transmission buildout to meet 2050 net-zero emissions goals.Utilities are uniquely positioned to accelerate the decarbonization of our electric grid by increasing transmission capacity on existing assets to unlock transmission constraints and relieve grid congestion. AES continues to be a proactive innovator pursuing new technologies and driving local adoption.""As we urgently move toward a net-zero future, utilities can test and bring on new technology to avoid system reliability issues while integrating record levels of renewables,"" said Hudson Gilmer, Chief Executive Officer of LineVision. ""GETs are the enabling tool needed to accelerate our path to a decarbonized grid. We are excited to work with AES on this important project.""Story continuesLineVision's DLR technology has been shown to significantly increase transmission capacity on existing lines quickly and at a fraction of the cost of traditional transmission upgrades while doubling the integration of renewable energy capacity on the grid.

186,a7eb155e-3e17-3063-a80c-f1854508b9c1,GM,2023-06-08,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Ford and General Motors,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-ford-123300046.html,1686141180,STORY,"['GM', 'F', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – June 7, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Ford F and General Motors GM.Industry: U.S. AutoLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2104345/2-hot-domestic-auto-stocks-to-harness-the-industrys-tailwindsDomestic automakers are enjoying robust recovery and growth as they overcome pandemic-related challenges and capitalize on favorable market trends. With improving inventory, incentives, and the surging popularity of EVs, the Zacks Domestic Auto Industry is well-positioned for a prosperous future. In this article, we delve into the key drivers that are propelling the U.S. auto industry to new heights and why you should not miss out on two top-ranked domestic auto stocks namely — Ford and General Motors — that are riding the wave of industry strength.About the IndustryThe Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through.The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in a fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development, and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.Key Investing ThemesImproving Inventory Levels Supporting Pent-Up Demand: With the gradual alleviation of challenges associated with new vehicle production, inventory levels are experiencing significant improvements.According to estimates from J.D. Power and LMC Automotive, retail inventory was approximately 1.3 million vehicles at the start of June, reflecting a 48% increase from the previous year. Strong production levels are expected to translate into extended days' supply, thereby providing shoppers with a greater abundance of vehicle options as we move forward.Story continuesSweeter Discount Deals Fueling Sales: The increased inventories resulted in more generous incentives being offered to potential buyers. Several manufacturers, including Ford, Hyundai and General Motors among others, have witnessed a significant surge in their incentive outlays. According to TrueCar, the average incentive amount reached $1,931 last month, representing a 13% increase from April and a substantial 64% increase from May 2022.By offering generous incentives, automakers and dealers aim to stimulate demand and entice potential buyers into making a purchase. These incentives not only provide financial benefits but also create a sense of urgency and encourage buyers to take advantage of the deals while they last.Rapidly Increasing EV Popularity Acts as a Vital Catalyst: The rising adoption of green vehicles driven by climate change concerns, technological advancements, and stringent fuel-emission standards is boosting the prospects of the U.S. auto industry. Electric car demand is skyrocketing and EV sales are consistently breaking records.Last year was the biggest for zero-emission vehicles in the United States. Legacy automakers are making significant efforts to establish a strong presence in the thriving e-mobility sector. The Inflation Reduction Act is set to further fuel EV sales. With the continued momentum and expected future growth, the prospects of the U.S. auto industry in the EV market are highly promising.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry is an 18-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #76, which places it in the top 30% of 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group's earnings growth potential.Before we present you two top-ranked stocks from the industry, let's take a look at the industry's stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 But Tops SectorThe Domestic Auto industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite but outperformed its larger sector over the past year. The industry has lost 15.8% against the S&amp;P 500's growth of 4.1%. The sector has declined 18.9% over the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 14.80X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 12.99X and the sector's 12.22X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 57.29X, as low as 8.78X and at a median of 15.31X.2 Best Stocks to Buy NowFord: It is one of the leading automakers in the nation. A strong vehicle mix supported by F-series trucks and SUV models, combined with a robust EV lineup, should drive Ford's growth. The company has tremendous growth opportunities, particularly with highly coveted franchises such as the F-150, the new Maverick, the new Bronco, and, undoubtedly, the Mustang.Further, Ford's ambitious rejig plan to split its EV business into a separate unit within the company is set to unlock significant growth opportunities. Ford's target of producing over 2 million EVs by 2026-end (representing 49% CAGR over the span of 2023-2026) augurs well. The company's high liquidity provides a solid foundation for investment in Ford+ priorities.Ford currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Value Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for F's 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 7.5%. The consensus mark for Ford's 2023 and 2024 EPS has moved north by 4 cents and 3 cents, respectively, over the past seven days. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on two occasions for as many misses, the average surprise being 24.3%.General Motors: One of the world's largest automakers, General Motors held the largest share of the U.S. auto market at 16% in 2022.General Motors' compelling portfolio with strong demand for its quality full-size pickups and SUVs bode well. The company's hot-selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra are driving the top line.Encouragingly, this legacy U.S. automaker will have nine EV models in the North America market this year, which will buoy top-line growth.The company's Ultium platform and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are set to scale up its e-mobility prowess. Its superior liquidity profile also instills confidence. General Motors' strides in autonomous vehicle development also augur well for long-term growth.GM currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Value Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors' 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 4.5%. The consensus mark for GM's 2023 and 2024 EPS has moved north by 14 cents and 22 cents, respectively, over the past 30 days. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on three occasions and missed once, the average surprise being 15.5%.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

187,147e41a0-cb50-4807-a488-8a9a627e3449,GM,2023-06-08,CEOs are less optimistic as they pull back hiring plans,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceos-are-less-optimistic-as-they-pull-back-hiring-plans-123138763.html,1686141098,STORY,['GM'],"[CEO optimism is dipping slightly as executives reduce their hiring plans amid concerns about inflation, higher interest rates, and the broader global economy.That was the takeaway from the latest quarterly survey of America's top business leaders released Wednesday by the Business Roundtable, an association in Washington composed of CEOs from hundreds of the nation's largest companies.It reported a modest three-point dip in the sentiment of CEOs who were asked what they expected for the next 6 months. The decline was especially notable on the hiring front, where expectations for hiring in the months ahead hit the lowest level since the third quarter of 2020, during the height of the pandemic.But at the same time, plans for capital investment actually increased by 1 point, and expectations for sales over the next six months held steady.America’s business leaders say they expect GDP growth of 1.5% this year. That is not a breakneck pace but one that would indicate a soft landing for the economy after a year of economic disruptions.At least one potential economic headwind is off the table with the recent debt-ceiling compromise that averted the prospect of a US default.General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra, the Business Roundtable chair, said in a statement Wednesday that “action by Congress and the Administration to raise the debt ceiling was a welcome signal from Washington that bipartisan agreement at a consequential moment is achievable,” she said.The Business Roundtable has been surveying members since 2002 and checks in each quarter to measure how businesses are planning for the immediate road ahead. This edition of the survey was conducted between May 17 through June 2 — as the debt ceiling deal was still being hammered out — and featured input from 143 CEOs.The overall sentiment level stood at a level of 76. That is below the Business Roundtable's historic average of 84 but also well above what the roundtable considers the “expansion or contraction threshold of 50.”Story continuesThe 20-year high for the survey came in the fourth quarter of 2021 when CEOs recorded a measure of 124. The historical low was 34 — recorded soon after the coronavirus pandemic began in early 2020.This quarter’s survey also focused on a longstanding priority of the business community in Washington: permitting reform.Of the CEOs surveyed, 82% said reforming the red tape around US permitting for energy infrastructure projects is needed. The debt deal signed into law this week included some — but not all — of the provisions that business groups have been seeking.President Joe Biden met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to discuss the debt limit on May 22. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)“We look forward to working with Congress to build on this important step forward with additional reforms and other policy wins for the U.S. economy,” Business Roundtable CEO Joshua Bolten said in a statement.Permitting reform was addressed in a limited way in the recently enacted law, with modest changes to the National Environmental Policy Act to streamline the process. The 1970 law that allows the federal government to analyze the environmental impacts of proposed projects.More reforms are needed, the CEOs say, to “improve American energy security and accelerate the clean energy transition.”Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"
188,9cce4604-e705-394c-ab20-a62451ac1e93,MKC,2023-06-08,What Makes McCormick (MKC) a New Buy Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-mccormick-mkc-buy-stock-160006439.html,1686153606,STORY,['MKC-V'],"[McCormick (MKC) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for McCormick is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For McCormick, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for McCormickFor the fiscal year ending November 2023, this spices and seasonings company is expected to earn $2.62 per share, which is a change of 3.6% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for McCormick. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0.5%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of McCormick to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. McCormick (MKC) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.59 a share, just 22 days from its upcoming earnings release on June 29, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.59 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.56 Zacks Consensus Estimate, McCormick has an Earnings ESP of 4.61%.MKC is part of a big group of Consumer Staples stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Corteva, Inc. (CTVA) as well.Slated to report earnings on August 3, 2023, Corteva, Inc. holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.66 a share 57 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Corteva, Inc. is $1.65, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.63%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, MKC and CTVA could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you may jump to 5 Most Dangerous Countries for LGBTQ+ American Travelers.Anti-LGBTQ+ sentiments are getting louder and wilder. Specifically, businesses that are supporting the LGBTQ+ community are under fire from conservative segments of the society. LGBT Capital notes that the purchasing power of the community is $3.9 trillion globally. While professing support for these communities allows them to get a hold of a significant slice of the pie, it's also drawing significant backlash toward them.Rainbow CapitalismJune is Pride Month for the LGBTQ+ community. Every year, millions of spectators gather for the New York Pride March, celebrating LGBTQ+ legal rights, social and self-acceptance, and also their pride. Also known as ""pink capitalism"" or ""pinkwashing,"" rainbow capitalism is when consumerism and capitalism get involved in the LGBT movement.Corporations have been criticized for expressing their support for the pride movement without actually having equity or inclusion policies in place. Many businesses are joining in the event with their marketing campaigns, queer influencer partnerships, and pride-logo products to demonstrate their support for Pride Month. LGBTQ+ individuals travel from all over the world to attend such pride events sponsored by LGBT-friendly companies.One prime example of a company that has been criticized for alleged ""rainbow washing"" is the retail giant Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT). While the company has been showcasing its support for pride month for many years, this year, it has received significant backlash from the LGBTQ community and its supporters for taking a stand without ""conviction"".Being a platinum sponsor of NYC Pride, Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) recently withdrew its Pride merchandise after receiving backlash and potential threats towards the safety of its workers. Evidently, Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) has shown that mass boycotts, lost revenue, and brand-harm can intimidate corporations from coming forward on their stance in regards to the LGBT community.Story continuesDangerous Countries for LGBTQ+ American Travelers2023 has witnessed more than 417 anti-LGBT bills being introduced in state legislatures across the United States. However, its still compartively a far safer country for the LGBT+ community. We have also covered the most gay-friendly cities in the US, which you can take a look at. These include Seattle, Albany and Austin, among others, which can also be regarded as the best places to live for the LGBT+ community.We have covered the safest countries for lgbt+ community to live, as well, in our list of the most LGBT-friendly countries in the world. However, the LGBTQ+ American travelers should stay cautious, especially when traveling to other countries.Many of the developing economies, such as Nigeria, criminalize LGBT+ rights, with even death penalties in countries that are far more conservative. Another dangerous country for LGBTQ+ American travelers is Qatar. Acts of homosexuality in the country are awarded the death penalty. Some other countries that are regarded as dangerous for LGBTQ+ communities include Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Iran.According to the U.S. State Department travel advisory, lesbian, gay, transgender, bisexual, queer, and other intersex travelers may face unique challenges when traveling to other countries. Approximately 70 countries consider consensual same-sex relations a crime, which is why it’s important to go through documents such as Traveler's Checklist and Country Information pages specific to LGBT+ American travelers.Many international travel and vacation companies, such as Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), are pro-LGBTQ+ companies, providing them with great travel experiences and accommodations. With regard to Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), not only is the company a great place to work with for this community, but it is also a top choice for travelers looking for gay-friendly or Pro-LGBTQ+ rentals.Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) listings have a no-discrimination policy its users have to follow. A recent case had a user, who was suspended due to a violation of the said policy, after refusing to rent to a gay couple. Similarly, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) has been the first major airline to protect LGBT team members from discrimination. Being the most gay-friendly airline, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) has been flying with pride along with other airlines such as Alaska Airlines and Atlas Air.Many businesses have also been emerging that are specifically catering to the LGBTQ+ community. With regards to travel, top LGBT travel companies include HE Travel, RSVP Vacation, Out Adventures, and VentureOut, to name a few.20 Most Dangerous Countries for LGBTQ+ American TravelersMybona/Shutterstock.comMethodologyIn order to compile the list of most dangerous countries for LGBTQ+ travelers, we have used Gay Travel Index 2023 from Spartacus, LGBTQ+ Travel Index from Asher &amp; Lyric, and Global Peace Index. The weighted average formula was used to assign weights to the above indexes and calculate an Insider Monkey score.Gay Travel Index and Asher &amp; Lyric Travel Index were assigned equal weights of 40% each, while Global Peace Index was assigned 20% weightage. The weighted averages determined an Insider Monkey average score for each country on which the rankings are based. The countries are ranked in descending order from the highest to the lowest score.Here are the most dangerous countries for LGBT+ American travelers:20. MalaysiaInsider Monkey Score: 157While Malaysia is a beautiful developing country in the Southeast, gay travelers may not be able to enjoy its gorgeous beaches and World Heritage Sites. The country severely punishes homosexuality, and state-backed discrimination is a major reason why LGBT+ American travelers may face challenges, prejudices, and threats on their visit to the country. Moreover, the population is generally conservative. As such, the country's tourism minister has also denied the existence of this community, and if found, homosexuality is punishable with up to 20 years in prison, fines, and whipping.19. TunisiaInsider Monkey Score: 160While Tunisia wholeheartedly accepts tourists, the LGBT community is not received with open arms. Homosexuality is a crime in the country that is punishable by up to 3 years imprisonment. As such, American LGBT+ travelers are advised to exercise discretion when traveling. Article 230 of the Penal Code condemns indecent exposure and indecent assault.18. TanzaniaInsider Monkey Score: 162Tanzania is an international hub for tourists and is known for its natural parks, gorgeous beaches, and wilderness areas. Like many other countries, Tanzania has proclaimed homosexuality as illegal, and anyone found can face a maximum penalty of 30 years or even life imprisonment. These laws are unlikely to be changed anytime soon. Even the residents of Tanzania consider it unlawful and an unnatural way of life. The general attitude is the same for others from the LGBT+ community like bisexual and trans individuals.17. RussiaInsider Monkey Score: 162In June 2013, Russia passed a new law concerning the ""propaganda"" of non-traditional sexual relations for minors. Last year, the so-called propaganda was extended by the lower house of parliament. Even the promotion of homosexuality online, in books, or in films is banned. Anya's activities or conduct will be subjected to major fines and penalties. Foreigners can also be expelled if they are found of non-compliance. The situation is worse in Russian republics like Chechnya.16. KuwaitInsider Monkey Score: 164Tourism is increasing in Kuwait, but the attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors that LGBTs may face are different compared to non-LGBT tourists. As such, tourists should refrain from attending parties or events that are controversial in the eyes of the law. Public ""immorality"" is prohibited; however, impersonating the same sex has now been outlawed.15. BruneiInsider Monkey Score: 165Another dangerous country for LGBT+ American travelers is Brunei. Spartacus Travel Index ranks the country at 159, while A&amp;F ranks it at number 203. Homosexuality is a crime in Brunei, with its punishment being death by stoning. This is applicable to all residents and tourists coming into the country, which is why it's best to exercise discretion when traveling here.14. UgandaInsider Monkey Score: 165Uganda is one of the most populous countries in Africa and apparently one of the most dangerous countries to travel to for the LGBTQ+ community. The Anti-Homosexuality Act of 2023 has pushed the country further into the spotlight. Those found engaging in same-sex relations will be imprisoned for a lifetime or charged with the death penalty. Travelers must exercise discretion when visiting the country or risk the charges stated above.13. United Arab EmiratesInsider Monkey Score: 167UAE is increasingly becoming a dangerous place for the LGBTQ+ community. Millions of visitors come to see Dubai and Abu Dhabi, but it can be the among the worst places for LGBT American travelers. UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Iran are all setting up coordinated efforts to crack down on their existence in the Emirates, and both the locals and foreigners are to bear the brunt. Homosexuality is strictly forbidden and punishable by law.12. MalawiInsider Monkey Score: 168Malawi strictly forbids homosexuality, which is why it is not safe for LGBT+ travelers to visit the country. Punishments for such acts are very strict, with same-sex acts resulting in 14 years in prison for men and up to 5 years imprisonment for women. Men cannot even keep long hair, and any man found having hair longer than their mouth can receive imprisonment for up to six months. The public sentiments regarding homosexuality aren't encouraging either, which is why the country is not a good place to travel to for this community.11. South SudanInsider Monkey Score: 169While South Sudan gained independence from Sudan back in 2011, the country still uses extreme interpretations of the Sharia law. This law implies that all acts of homosexuality are forbidden in the country, and punishments could range anywhere between lashes and even death. Even the majority of the population in the country is against such acts and individuals, which is why it is one of the worst countries to travel to for the LGBTQ+ community.10. EthiopiaInsider Monkey Score: 171While Ethiopia is already a worst travel destination due to its civil unrest, crime, conflicts, and terrorism, it is even worst for LGBT+ American travelers. LGBTQ+ community has no rights in the country, and the general population is against homosexuality as well. Same-sex relations are outlawed, and those found guilty can face imprisonment of up to 15 years. Some religious groups are very extreme and urge authorities to ban trips that are organized by tour operators catering to this population.9. SudanInsider Monkey Score: 173Similar to Sudan, homosexuality is a crime that is punishable under the country's law. The general population is also against the idea of homosexuality, and overall it is not a safe country to travel to. Spartacus ranks the country at 159, while Asher &amp; Lyric places it at number 195 to depict how far this country is behind on safety for LGBTQ travelers. The Sudanese Penal Code criminalizes acts of sodomy, ""indecent acts"", ""indecent acts in public spaces"", ""seduction"", and materials that are contrary to ""morals"". Hence, it is one of the most dangerous countries for gay travelers.8. EgyptInsider Monkey Score: 174Egypt has always been a traveler's favorite, thanks to its huge pyramids and historical and religious significance. However, the country holds negative laws pertaining to homosexuality, which is why it has made it to our list. Since 2013, more than 250 LGBT individuals have been arrested in the country, and there is a consistent crackdown on such individuals. Same-sex acts can lead to up to 3 years’ imprisonment, while possession of homosexual materials will lead to two years’ prison along with a fine. LGBTQ+ travelers are strictly advised not to disclose their sexual identity to anyone or use any dating applications in the country.7. IranInsider Monkey Score: 181LGBTQ+ travelers must avoid traveling to Iran due to extreme punishments for acts of homosexuality, transgenderism and bisexuality. Same-sex acts in the country will be subjected to 31 lashes, while intercourse will lead to 100 lashes or the death penalty. More than 5,000 gays and lesbians have been executed in the country for such offenses since 1979.6. LibyaInsider Monkey Score: 184Libya is an overall dangerous country to travel to regardless of the sexual orientation of individuals. Terrorism, violence, and civil unrest have made the country very unsafe. Moreover, the laws prohibit any or all activities that fall outside of heterosexual marriage. Anyone found going against these laws is subjected to amputation and flogging.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Dangerous Countries for LGBTQ+ American Travelers.  Suggested Articles:25 Most LGBTQ-Friendly Countries in the World15 Most Powerful Currencies in the World20 American Cities With the Highest Uninsured RatesDisclosure: none. 20 Most Dangerous Countries for LGBTQ+ American Travelers is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

ISRG is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strength in robotics. The optimism led by solid first-quarter 2023 and its progress on the artificial intelligence (AI) front is expected to contribute further. The risk of procedure adoption and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 41.6% compared with the 2.3% rise of the industry and the S&amp;P 500’s 4.5% growth.The renowned provider of minimally invasive care and the pioneer of robotic-assisted surgery has a market capitalization of $110.63 billion. It projects 13% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Intuitive Surgical’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other two, with the average earnings surprise being 1.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strength in Robotics: We are upbeat about Intuitive Surgical’s robot-based da Vinci surgical system that enables minimally-invasive surgery and reduces the trauma associated with open surgery. The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology that has provided the company with solid exposure to medical mechatronics, robotics and AI for the healthcare space.Per the first-quarter 2023 earnings call in April, the installed base of da Vinci systems grew approximately 12% year over year. The utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, was up 13% from the prior-year quarter.Progress on the AI Front: We are upbeat about the growing adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, the use of information technology for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model. These indicate the high prevalence of AI in the MedTech space.Per Intuitive Surgical’s management, the rise of medical mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging has enabled new approaches to old problems. AI has been enhancing Intuitive Surgical’s product portfolio with clinical applications, diagnostic support, operational efficiency, electronic health record systems, practice workflows and supply chain management.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: Intuitive Surgical’s solid first-quarter 2023 results buoy our optimism. The company witnessed continued growth in da Vinci procedure volume.DownsidesRisk of Procedure Adoption: Intuitive Surgical faces the risk of adoption of its procedures. This is because adoption growth takes time, as each procedure needs to gain credibility. Furthermore, the wide use of the company’s products requires the training of surgical teams. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete such training.Stiff Competition: Intuitive Surgical used to enjoy a monopoly in the market for robots used in abdominal surgery since the launch of its flagship device, the da Vinci System, in 2000. However, after the regulatory approval of Transenterix's surgical robot for abdominal surgery in 2017, competition for Intuitive Surgical intensified.Estimate TrendIntuitive Surgical is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023.

194,4ef58fd8-87c2-3490-9080-99b2a7c85ab7,BXP,2023-06-08,Thinking Of Buying Boston Properties? Here Are The Properties And Tenants You'd Add To Your Portfolio,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thinking-buying-boston-properties-properties-174937949.html,1686160177,STORY,"['BXP', 'BIIB', 'GOOGL']","[When investors consider the purchase of a real estate investment trust (REIT), along with performance and dividends, they need to consider the properties and tenants that accompany that REIT. Several questions must be answered: Are the tenants long-term and stable? Are they strong enough to survive recessions and market downturns? Is the portfolio diversified by location, type and annualized base rent (ABR)?Take a look at one of the largest office REITs today to see whether it answers the above questions affirmatively.Boston Properties Inc. (NYSE: BXP) is a Boston-based office REIT with 54.5 million square feet in 192 properties concentrated among six of the largest U.S. cities — Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. The firm calls itself “the largest publicly traded developer, owner and manager of premier workplaces in the United States.” Boston Properties has had a 555% total return since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1997. It’s a member of the S&amp;P 500.As of March 31, Boston Properties had 91% of its in-service properties leased, with a weighted average lease term (WALT) of 7.6 years. It presently has 4 million square feet valued at $3.3 billion in its active pipeline property development and another 17.6 million square feet in its future development pipeline.The Boston area has the largest amount of square footage, but the vacancy rate, as shown in the chart below, is a bit high at 9.03%, and there is another 787,192 square feet that expires before the end of the year.One potential remedy that Boston Properties has begun to use is the expansion of offices to life science companies, such as Biogen Inc. and AstraZeneca. Boston Properties has a six-story, 271,000-square-foot building in Boston that is 100% leased to Biogen and a 566,000-square-foot building that is 100% preleased to AstraZeneca, with an estimated initial occupancy starting in mid-2026.Largest tenantsThe following chart shows the top 20 tenants presently leasing space from Boston Properties:Story continuesIt’s clear from the list that Boston Properties has a well-diversified top 20 client list, with many of its tenants publicly traded. Its top four tenants, Salesforce Inc. (NYSE: CRM), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) and Akamai Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM) account for about 11% of the total ABR.As for industry diversification, technology and media companies are the largest group, with 21% of rent, followed by legal services at 19% and financial services at 17%. While only three groups account for 57%, the remaining 43% is divided among eight other industry classifications.Some of its largest tenants are well-known market leaders.Salesforce Inc. is a San Francisco-based software company that provides sales, customer service, marketing automation, e-commerce, analytics and application development. Salesforce was founded by Marc Benioff, a former executive at Oracle Corp. Its IPO was in 2004. It was the first cloud computing company to reach $1 billion in annual revenue in 2009. As of September 2022, it was the 61st largest company in the world by market capitalization and has a present market capitalization of $206.63 billion. Salesforce contributes 3.43% of Boston Properties’ ABR.Don't miss:How These Accredited Investors Pulled In Better Returns Than Warren BuffettElon Musk Is Bullish On Austin. Here's How To Invest In The City's Growth Before He Floods It With New Tech WorkersAlphabet Inc. is a Mountain View, California-based multinational technology conglomerate. It was created in October 2015 by a restructuring of Google to become the parent company of Google. Alphabet is the third-largest technology company by annual revenue in the world, and one of the FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) stocks that comprise the Nasdaq 100. The original founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, were replaced by Sundar Pichai near the end of 2019. It has a market capitalization of $1.62 trillion. Alphabet’s share is 2.81% of Boston Properties’ ABR.Biogen Inc. is a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based multinational biotechnology company. It specializes in the discovery and delivery of therapies to treat a range of neurological diseases. Biogen was founded in 1978 in Geneva by a group of prominent biologists. At the time it was called Biotechnology Geneva. In 2003, Biogen merged with IDEC Pharmaceuticals in San Diego, and the name was changed to Biogen Idec. With this merger, Biogen became the third-largest biotechnology company in the world.Over the decades, Biogen has grown by acquiring several other pharmaceutical companies that have developed notable treatments for cancer, multiple sclerosis, hemophilia, spinal muscular atrophy and other diseases. In 2020, Biogen constructed a state-of-the-art facility in Switzerland to produce a new drug called aducanumab, which will be used to treat Alzheimer’s disease.Biogen contributes 2.61% of the total ABR.Other FactorsBoston Properties has $15.7 billion in debt, of which 77.58% is unsecured and 22.42% is secured. It has $3.2 billion in liquidity, which includes $1.7 billion in cash and a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.Boston Properties pays a quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share. The dividend has not been increased since December 2019, but to its credit, Boston Properties never cut or suspended its dividend during the pandemic. The $3.92 annual dividend yields 7.8%, which is more than double its five-year dividend yield average of 3.85%. With the forward funds from operations (FFO) of $7.16, the payout ratio is a safe 54%.Despite the lack of dividend growth, the yield has expanded because of a substantial loss of share price from obstacles such as COVID-19, an increasing home-based workforce, inflation, Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and ongoing fears of recession.Having survived threats to share price from COVID-19, Boston Properties rallied from $63 in 2020 to $125 by March 2022. But with the interest rate hikes and concerns about increasing vacancies, office REITs have tumbled again since then. Boston Properties fell to $48.50 by the end of March. Since then, it’s rebounded, but only by about 8%.It also doesn’t help the office REIT sub-sector when Wall Street gurus like Charlie Munger of Berkshire Hathaway and more recently Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk are predicting the demise of commercial office buildings by the end of 2023. Ironically, the same Musk, along with the late billionaire real estate developer Sam Zell, recently chastised home-based workers, saying they were less productive and that it’s hypocritical to ask first responders and others to work on-site while they have the luxury of working from home.Recent EventsOn April 25, Boston Properties announced its first-quarter 2023 operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $1.73 was lower than FFO of $1.82 in the first quarter of 2022, but revenue of $803.2 million was up from $754.31 million year over year. Boston Properties also said that second-quarter FFO would come in at a range from $1.79 to $1.81 and that full-year 2023 FFO would be $7.14-$7.20.On May 17, Boston Properties announced it was filing for a mixed shelf of debt securities, guarantees, common stock, preferred stock, stock purchase contracts, depository shares and warrants, but the size of the offering was not disclosed.There was one recent insider purchase, and that’s a positive sign. On May 31, Director Carol Einiger purchased 10,000 shares at an average price of $47.41 for an approximate total of $474,100.On June 6, Boston Properties participated in the 2023 NAREIT REITweek Investor Conference.There have been no recent analyst upgrades or downgrades on Boston Properties. The most recent analyst rating was on May 10 when Citigroup analyst Emmanuel Korchman maintained Boston Properties with a Neutral rating but lowered the price target 25% from $72 to $54.Short interest on Boston Properties is 5.52%. When compared to rival office REITs such as SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG), whose short interest is 27.06%, that doesn’t seem so bad. But it’s still another headwind for Boston Properties.In summary, Boston Properties is a well-diversified office REIT, with the kind of Grade A long-term tenants that are unlikely to have problems paying rent. But the dark cloud hanging over the heads of office REITs in 2023 continues to prevail.It is unlikely that office REITs will sit passively by and allow vacancies to pile up. Office space can always be converted into other types of facilities. Mixed-use space that incorporates offices, apartments, restaurants, nightclubs and health facilities is one of the most recent trends among REITs. Long-term investors have a real opportunity to pick up shares of Boston Properties now with a terrific dividend yield and the potential for outstanding total returns over several years.Over the past five years, private market real estate investments have outperformed the publicly traded REIT market by about 50%.

Shares have lost about 3.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Ventas due for a breakout?

The bottom line was, however, lower than the prior-year quarter’s tally of 79 cents, which included a benefit of $33 million from net Health and Human Services (HHS) grants.Results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues. Ventas’ same-store cash NOI for the SHOP increased year over year on strong pricing power and margin expansion. SHOP occupancy also improved from the prior-year period.

Collaborating with key program partners including the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science, NASA, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the program's renewal on World Oceans Day builds on over 20 years of groundbreaking ocean and marine life research from Royal Caribbean Group ships.OceanScope leverages a unique, comprehensive suite of oceanographic and meteorological instruments, located onboard Royal Caribbean Group ships, that generates continuous, simultaneous collection of the ocean's vital signs such as the structure of currents, sea surface temperature, carbon dioxide concentrations, and salinity taken along the repetitive ship routes – which allows scientists to monitor changes on scales of seasons, years, and even decades.""At Royal Caribbean Group, every day is World Oceans Day – and we are thrilled to renew a program as impactful to oceanic research as OceanScope,"" said Jason Liberty, president and CEO, Royal Caribbean Group. ""We're dedicated to sustaining our planet and delivering the best vacations, responsibly – and our decades-long support of this unique initiative is testament to that. We can't wait to see how OceanScope, and our scientific collaborators progress our understanding of ocean health and conservation.""OceanScope's open-source database is available to the international scientific research community worldwide. The resulting data products and peer-reviewed research are key to informing ocean and conservation policy.Story continuesLaunched in 2002, the program helped verify for the first time that ocean acidification – a reduction in pH over an extended period of time caused primarily by uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere was occurring in the Caribbean Sea but at varying rates. Ocean acidification is detrimental to calcifying organisms such as oysters, clams, sea urchins, shallow water corals, deep sea corals, and calcareous plankton, and an ongoing concern for the entire food web.Extending OceanScope on Royal Caribbean Group ships helps ensure ongoing monitoring and changes of key ocean and atmospheric processes in critical ecosystems.""We are most grateful to renew our successful collaboration with Royal Caribbean Group,"" said Dr. Peter Ortner, research professor of marine biology and ecology at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science. ""This is an extraordinary example of how private industry, academic research institutions, and government agencies are collaborating to amass an incredibly valuable dataset highlighting the intricate connection between the ocean, atmosphere, and climate.""As of 2023, data has been collected from over 100,000 nautical miles sailed from four ships, traveling across the Caribbean Sea, Galapagos, North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Royal Caribbean International's Allure of the Seas and Adventure of the Seas and Celebrity Cruises' Celebrity Flora and Celebrity Equinox are currently providing data to scientists at NOAA, the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, and the community at large. Royal Caribbean Group intends to share the program's learning to its more than eight million guests annually in an effort to increase ocean literacy.""NASA is excited to revive its long-standing partnership with OceanScope, which is a valuable player in the Agency-led efforts to understand Earth climate today, and inform humanity for what waits tomorrow. Looking at Earth's ocean's from space and leveraging in situ observations enabled by projects like OceanScope is what allows us to build robust knowledge of ocean's role in climate, which controls our planet's heat, energy, and water,"" said Dr. Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, lead of NASA's Climate Variability and Change Focus Area and program director of the NASA Ocean Physics program at NASA HQ, Washington, D.C.""Sustained and systematic operations with automated instruments on a variety of platforms, including this innovative collaboration, is a key to maintaining and strengthening the World Meteorological Organization's and Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission's Global Ocean Observing System to which NOAA is a major contributor,"" said Rik Wanninkhof, a NOAA senior scientist and ocean carbon expert at the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory. ""In particular, the CO2, surface temperature and salinity data from Royal Caribbean Group's ships are major contributors to these ocean observing networks to determine the ocean's carbon sink strength and ocean acidification.""Royal Caribbean Group's conservation work extends beyond OceanScope, with the company championing a broader commitment to sustaining the planet as part of its SEA the Future platform. Royal Caribbean Group is actively working to decarbonize its business through innovation, collaborative partnerships and a transition to cleaner fuels, smarter technologies, and improved energy efficiencies.

GIII posted better-than-expected results in first-quarter fiscal 2024, wherein the top and the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share outpaced the consensus estimate of a loss of 9 cents per share. However, the bottom line compared unfavorably with the year-earlier quarter’s earnings of 72 cents per share.G-III Apparel’s digital business reported solid growth of more than 20%, mainly backed by building the Amazon business that tripled in the first quarter of last year. Growth with pure-play digital retailers has compensated the traditional digital channels. Further, the platform of the company’s own DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris e-commerce sites are driven by the latest look and feel, updated loyalty programs, expanded CRM capabilities and advanced technical operations. Management has raised the outlook for fiscal 2024.Impressively, shares of the company have increased 28% during the trading hours on Jun 6. Shares of the company have gained 27.5% outperforming the industry’s 0.4% drop.Q1 in DetailNet sales fell 11.9% year over year to $606.6 million but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $560 million.

Quote The company’s power brands, DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger outperformed management’s expectations, led by categories, such as dresses, sportswear and suit separates. Its North American DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris businesses performed well.Moreover, gross profit jumped 1.5% year over year to $249.8 million. Meanwhile, the gross margin of 41.2% increased 550 basis points (bps), mainly attributed to the lower gross margin at the wholesale unit. The wholesale segment’s gross margin was 39.9%, up 580 bps year over year. The Retail unit’s gross margin was 50.9%, up 1000 bps from the year-ago period on lower inflationary pressures in product and transit expenses.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 23% year over year to $228 million. Further, operating expenses came in at $15.3 million in the fiscal first quarter, compared with $54.5 million in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesOther UpdatesManagement has announced a new licensing agreement for the Halston brand, which is an American heritage brand.

Halston is an American heritage brand with a legacy of glamorous designs across a range of price points First deliveries are likely to be in 2024 fall.Management is on track with the development of Nautica and Donna Karan brands. For Nautica, the company is working on bringing the Spring 2024 jeans line to life, while for Donna Karan, it is leveraging the brand’s classic, contemporary, and elevated feel and widening its appeal to a broader consumer base.The company’s strategic priorities include driving power brands across categories, enhancing its portfolio via ownership of brands and licensing opportunities, expanding global reach, maximizing omnichannel capabilities and scaling the private label business. Additionally, the company has seen higher warehousing costs on increased inventory levels and overall inflationary pressures.Nonetheless, the company has been making progress on rightsizing its inventory. As port congestion and lead times have normalized, management has adjusted the warehouse space appropriately. This trend is likely to continue throughout the year, driven by moderate freight costs.Other Financial DetailsG-III Apparel ended first-quarter fiscal 2024 with cash and cash equivalents of $289.7 million and total debt of $543 million. Total stockholders’ equity was $1,380.4 million.It ended the fiscal first quarter in a net debt position of roughly $250 million versus $83 million in the prior year. The increase in net debt was buoyed by the $170 million in net cash utilized to complete the Karl Lagerfeld buyout and $44 million for stock repurchases. The company had cash and availability of about $800 million under its revolving credit agreement at the end of the quarter.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned $17 million to its shareholders via stock repurchases.OutlookThe fiscal 2024 outlook includes the inflationary pressures on consumers and on the company’s operations, along with incremental costs related to managing increased levels of inventory. Management expects solid cash flows this year as the inventory levels normalize.For fiscal 2024, management projects net sales of about $3.29 billion and net income between $125 million and $130 million, or between $2.65 per share and $2.75 per share.

Learn to spot the language that fraudsters use.SINGAPORE, June 8, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital scams are everywhere in our daily lives. Whether at home, the workplace or on the go, we're inundated by phone, text and email with offers for ""free gifts"" and traps to ""act now"" to supply personal information before a vital service gets cut off. And this deluge of fraud messaging is working.(PRNewsfoto/Visa)A new research report out today from Visa and YouGov, ""The Language of Fraud,"" brings to light that when it comes to spotting scams, cybercriminals are finding vulnerabilities among even the most tech-savvy consumers. While nearly half of the population in Asia Pacific are confident they can recognise a scam, 40 percent are likely to miss the requisite red flags in digital communications.From your bank asking you to change your login details, to an email alerting you that you've won products from your favorite store, or even text messages about a job offer at a top-tier company offering a large salary, scammers are using more and more sophisticated tactics to steal our confidential information and our money. Over a period of 12 months ending November 2022, Visa blocked USD7.2 billion worth of attempted fraudulent payments across 122 million transactions globally, stopping fraudsters in their tracks.""Understanding the language of fraud is increasingly essential in our digital-first world. Today it's not nearly so obvious you're dealing with a criminal, and that applies to the language they use in their communications – no one is immune,"" said Joe Cunningham, Regional Risk Officer, Visa, Asia Pacific.  ""Education around the language of scams is an integral part of our consumer protection. By highlighting the communicative strategies, words and phrases used by fraudsters, we hope people are able spot the language of fraud as it stands today, which ultimately helps to protect them and the whole region.""Story continuesExploring the language of fraud: A disconnect between awareness and actionFalling victim to cyber fraud is costly. In Asia Pacific, an estimated one in four consumers are online fraud victims[1] and in Singapore alone SGD660.7 million was lost to fraud in 2022 bringing a total of almost SGD1.3 billion lost to fraud in the past two years.[2]According to Visa's new report, which surveyed 15,339 adults across 14 markets in Asia Pacific, scammers appear to be thriving in the gap between consumers' awareness of the language of fraud and their actual behaviour. Among top findings:Confidence is deceiving. Consumers in India and the Philippines feel the most confident of their knowledge of scams, with 63 percent and 56 percent respectively stating that they are ""very knowledgeable"", as compared to Japan with only 14 percent of consumers indicating the same. However, the findings show that consumers in India and the Philippines more than three times more likely than consumers in Japan to have been a victim of scam.Age and awareness. While more than 50 percent of consumers in Asia Pacific assume older adults (aged 35 – 55+) are more likely to fall victim to online scams than younger adults (aged 18 – 34), and more younger adults than older adults considered themselves extremely or very knowledgeable about scams, the data suggests quite the opposite: Younger adults are 1.3 times more likely than older adults to have fallen for a scam.Suspicious communication. Across Asia Pacific, requests to reset passwords are the top form of communication that people are suspicious of (41%). Notifications of a reward/coupon or gift comes in second (22%). This varies by geography - New Zealand (50%), Japan (50%), and Hong Kong (49%) rank highest in suspicion for password reset requests. India, Vietnam and Indonesia rank the lowest. As compared to other types of communications, Indonesia (32%) and Taiwan (29%) are most suspicious of rewards, coupons, and gift cards, while Japan and Korea are least suspicious.The most enticing clickbait messages that consumers in Asia Pacific would most likely respond to capitalises on consumer excitement, and fraudulently touts ""Free Gift,"" ""exclusive deals"" or ""Giveaway"", the survey found.Take a few extra moments to decipher the language of fraudConsumers can better protect themselves by taking a few extra moments before clicking, including taking time to understand the way fraudsters use language. Among simple, but effective best practices: Keep personal information to yourself. Don't click on links before verifying they'll take you where they say they will. Turn on purchase alerts, which provide near real-time notification by text message or email of purchases made with your account. Call the number on corporate websites or the back of your credit and debit cards if you are unsure if a communication is valid – don't just call the number possibly provided by the scammer in their text or email.Protection is Visa's top priorityWhile cybercrime persists in an increasingly digital world, Visa is mission-driven to protect consumers and mitigate fraud. Over the past five years, the company has invested more than USD10 billion in technology, including to reduce fraud and increase network security.

Both companies offer valuable exposure to their respective industries with operations worldwide.Now may be a good time to buy both of these conglomerates as they remain sound investments and their valuations are attractive at the momentSound Value Intriguingly, as a leading global insurance provider, American International Group currently has an “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for Value. At current levels, AIG stock is very attractive for its wide range of property casualty insurance, life insurance, retirement solutions, and other financial services in more than 80 countries.Similarly, among hotel operators, Marriott International gives valuable exposure to investors as a leading worldwide hospitality company focused on lodging management and franchising. Marriott has a “B” Style Scores grade for Value and remains attractive for its expansive reach with the company operating and franchising over 8,400 properties across 138 countries.P/E Valuation: Attributing to their high-Value grades are AIG’s and Marriott’s price-to-earnings valuations. Trading at $56 a share AIG trades at just 8.5X forward earnings which is on par with the industry average and nicely beneath the S&amp;P 500’s 19.9X.Furthermore, AIG is a leader in its space and trades 41% below its decade-high of 21.7X and at a 26% discount to the median of 11.5X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMarriott’s P/E valuation isn’t as eye-popping at 21.5X forward earnings but this is still near the benchmark and roughly on par with its industry average of 20.2X. Plus, Marriott is an industry leader and trades attractively relative to its past. Trading at $177 a share, Marriott still trades well below its own decade-long high of 301.5X and offers a slight discount to the median of 23.7X.Steady GrowthAs mature and renowned companies, AIG and Marriott’s growth is still intriguing and has become more attractive with earnings estimate revisions rising for the current fiscal year and FY24.Story continuesIn this regard, AIG’s earnings are now forecasted to soar 44% this year at $6.56 per share compared to EPS of $4.55 in 2022. Even better, AIG’s FY24 earnings are expected to jump another 20% at $7.88 per share. On the top line, sales are forecasted to be up 8% this year and rise another 3% in FY24 to $50.77 billion.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLooking at Marriott, earnings are projected to climb 25% in FY23 at $8.39 per share compared to EPS of $6.69 in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to rise another 8% at $9.08 per share. Total sales are forecasted to jump 13% this year and rise another 4% in FY24 to $24.35 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRespectable DividendsAlso intriguing to investors are AIG and Marriott’s respectable dividends. AIG especially stands out with a 2.29% yield at $1.28 per share. This is above the S&amp;P 500’s 1.48% average and its industry average of 2.10%.As inflation eases and AIG continues its post-pandemic growth and recovery it’s quite possible the company will be even more generous to shareholders. To that point, AIG stock had just hit its peak dividend yield at 6.6% prior to the pandemic as shown in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConsidering most Hotel operators are focused on sustaining growth and expansion rather than providing a dividend, Marriott's yield is also respectable at $1.15% or $2.08 per share. Marriott’s dividend should also increase as we move further from the pandemic and global economic headwinds subside.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWith both sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) AIG and Marriott stocks are up 7% and 5% respectively to start the month. Strong value, steady growth, and earnings estimate revisions trending higher over the last 60 days are good reasons to buy stock in both conglomerates.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MAR recently announced an agreement with Hiap Hoe Limited, to launch the Aloft Hotels brand in Singapore. Post a strategic conversion, the company expects to open Aloft Singapore Novena in the third quarter of 2023. The initiative paves a path for the opening of the brand’s first property and the company’s 14th property in the region.Located in Zhongshan Park (in the cultural district of Balestier), the 785-room hotel features contemporary and dynamic space that caters to the needs of design-savvy, next-generation travelers and locals alike. It also it comes with a range of amenities, including fitness centers, on-site dining, outdoor pool and meeting spaces. It also offers convenient access to Central Business District, leisure attractions and green spaces.Given the attributes of its strategically-placed location and vibrant offerings, management is optimistic with respect to the hotel opening.Emphasis On Hotel ConversionsMarriott International emphasizes on hotel conversions to drive growth. Conversions help owners and franchisees to plug into the Marriott system at a quicker pace compared with the opening of a newly-built hotel.During the first quarter of 2023, conversions represented nearly 30% of signings and 25% of hotel openings. During the quarter, the company emphasized on an 8-hotel portfolio conversion in Vietnam (referred to as Vinpearl). Recently, it initiated Vinpearl Round 2, leading to an addition of seven hotels (or 2500 rooms). The company stated that three of the seven hotels are conversions and are expected to open in 2023. MAR expects positive development trends to continue on the back of new development and multi-unit conversion opportunities.Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchComing to price performance, shares of Marriott have gained 4.3% in the past three months against the industry’s 2.3% decline. The company is benefiting from its focus on expansion initiatives, digital innovation and loyalty programs. During first-quarter 2023, the company witnessed robust demand in the United States, Canada and Asia Pacific region. The company benefited from robust leisure demand and ADR, while business transient demand continued to improve. During the quarter, global demand for hotels increased significantly across all regions.With global trends improving, it expects the recovery momentum to continue. Attributes such as pent-up demand for all types of travel, the shift of spending towards experiences versus goods, lifting of travel restrictions and opening borders (in most markets) are likely to aid the company in the upcoming periods. Earnings estimates for 2023 have increased in the past 60 days, depicting analysts’ optimism regarding the stock’s growth potential.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderMarriott currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are:Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

211,d6e12647-0e87-318f-8d52-4ce70167b052,MAR,2023-06-08,5 Stocks With High ROE to Buy as Markets Appear on Cruise Mode,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-high-roe-buy-122200527.html,1686140520,STORY,"['BWA', 'MAR', 'TRTN', 'ATKR', 'UPBD']","[The U.S. equity markets appear to have steadied after President Joe Biden signed the debt ceiling bill to avert a potential default on the federal government’s debt. A default would have made the government incapable of borrowing any more money or repaying its bills, endangering the global economy and affecting prices and mortgage rates in other countries. The markets were further propelled by a better-than-expected May jobs report that allayed the fears of recession from the near-term horizon to at least until 2024.The jobs report revealed that payrolls in the public and private sectors increased by 339,000 in May, significantly higher than broad-based expectations of 190,000 rise. While professional and business services added 64,000 jobs, government and healthcare sectors contributed 56,000 and 52,000 job additions, respectively. Average hourly earnings, a key inflation indicator, improved 0.3% for the month and were in sync with expectations. The focus has now shifted to the Federal Reserve’s Jun 13-14 policy meeting, which is likely to be another potential market catalyst.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Marriott International, Inc. MAR, BorgWarner Inc. BWA, Atkore Inc. ATKR, Upbound Group, Inc. UPBD and Triton International Limited TRTN are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Story continuesScreening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 10 stocks that qualified the screen:Marriott: Headquartered in Bethesda, MD, Marriott is a leading worldwide hospitality company focused on lodging management and franchising.

(NWSA) Now Trades Above Golden Cross: Time to Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/news-corp-nwsa-now-trades-135504805.html,1686146104,STORY,['NWSA'],"[From a technical perspective, News Corporation (NWSA) is looking like an interesting pick, as it just reached a key level of support. NWSA's 50-day simple moving average crossed above its 200-day simple moving average, which is known as a ""golden cross"" in the trading world.There's a reason traders love a golden cross -- it's a technical chart pattern that can indicate a bullish breakout is on the horizon. This kind of crossover is formed when a stock's short-term moving average breaks above a longer-term moving average. Typically, a golden cross involves the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.A successful golden cross event has three stages. It first begins when a stock's price on the decline bottoms out. Then, its shorter moving average crosses above its longer moving average, triggering a positive trend reversal. The third and final phase occurs when the stock maintains its upward momentum.This kind of chart pattern is the opposite of a death cross, which is a technical event that suggests future bearish price movement.NWSA could be on the verge of a breakout after moving 11.9% higher over the last four weeks. Plus, the company is currently a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank.Looking at NWSA's earnings expectations, investors will be even more convinced of the bullish uptrend. For the current quarter, there have been 1 changes higher compared to none lower over the past 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up as well.Given this move in earnings estimates and the positive technical factor, investors may want to keep their eye on NWSA for more gains in the near future.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is News Corporation (NWSA). NWSA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 23.99, which compares to its industry's average of 25.36. Over the past 52 weeks, NWSA's Forward P/E has been as high as 27.67 and as low as 13.47, with a median of 19.51.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is NWSA's P/B ratio of 1.19. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.39. Within the past 52 weeks, NWSA's P/B has been as high as 1.36 and as low as 0.94, with a median of 1.11.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that News Corporation is likely being undervalued right now.

The company’s commitment to return capital to shareholders and upbeat fiscal 2024 view spark confidence.However, commodity cost inflation is expected to weigh on gross margins. Supply-chain disruptions and tough labor market will play spoilsports. Unfavorable foreign currency translations and high R&amp;D expenses are also likely to limit profits. Also, elevated leverage of the firm may restrict its financial flexibility to tap onto growth opportunities. Thus, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.(You can read the full research report on Toyota Motor here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Verizon Communications have declined -3.5% over the past six months against the Zacks Wireless National industry’s decline of -10.4%. The company is witnessing significant 5G adoption and fixed wireless broadband momentum. Its 5G mobility service offers a premium experience across various industries such as public safety, health care, retail and more. Strong demand for Fios and fixed wireless products are tailwinds.Verizon’s mmWave footprint delivers game-changing experiences for the densest parts of the network and offers reliable signal waves with enhanced efficiency and less interference for consumers.However, retail prepaid and postpaid net losses are hindering the top line.

The program awarded grants worth around $50 million to expand broadband Internet service in unserved areas.This expansion in Florida will encourage job creation, capital investment and the strengthening and diversification of local economies.Comcast Leveraging Xfinity 10G Network to Aid ProspectsShares of Comcast have risen 12.9% year to date outperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector, which increased 8.6% in the same time frame.Comcast Corporation Price and Consensus Comcast Corporation Price and ConsensusComcast Corporation price-consensus-chart | Comcast Corporation Quote In December 2022, Comcast announced its next-generation Xfinity 10G network based on DOCSIS 4.0 technology.

218,ae4a4edd-f008-3127-bf82-c41cae8927b6,VZ,2023-06-08,Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-vz-attracting-130013730.html,1686142813,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned -7.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless National industry, which Verizon falls in, has lost 8.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -10.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.68 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -9.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.69 indicates a change of +0.2% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Verizon.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Verizon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $33.53 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $135.08 billion and $136.76 billion estimates indicate -1.3% and +1.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $32.91 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.9%. EPS of $1.20 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.71 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.36%. The EPS surprise was +0.84%.Over the last four quarters, Verizon surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband brings power and performance comparable to a wired broadband internet connection to customers’ pockets.Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband enables people to do things on their mobile device that many could only do before when connected to their home internet service. This includes everything from downloading huge documents and streaming movies in HD audio and video, to playing console quality games and conducting video chats, video conferencing and FaceTime calls with clear sound and video.“We are thrilled to welcome Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband network throughout Indiana, as it represents a major step forward in our efforts to build a truly connected state,” said Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch, Indiana’s Secretary of Agriculture and Rural Development. “This technology will not only bring faster speeds and more reliable connectivity, but expanding 5G service into the more rural areas of Indiana will unlock new opportunities for innovation and economic growth.”“Verizon is widely known for having an exceptionally reliable 5G network experience, and it’s exciting to see the positive impact our work has had in Indiana,” said Dean Brauer, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “Our network engineers work tirelessly to provide unmatched connectivity to our customers across Indiana, and we will not slow down.”Network enhancements in Indiana These deployments use Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Verizon will deploy 5G Ultra Wideband using up to 100 MHz of C-Band spectrum in multiple Indiana markets, and will add even more bandwidth once all of its licensed spectrum is made available. This additional bandwidth, which will be available at the end of this year, will provide exceptional speed and capacity.Story continuesLastly, the addition of 5G service in Indiana will result in exponential increases in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community, which requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Get the most of our 5G Ultra WidebandFor customers in Indiana, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps.

SWK have gained 9% in the year-to-date period. The upside can be linked to accretive pricing actions and strength in its end markets.Catalysts Behind the Share Price IncreaseStanley Black is benefiting from pricing actions, productivity gains and strength in aerospace and auto markets within the Industrial segment. The company expects low single-digit organic growth for the segment in 2023.SWK is making efforts to eliminate and reduce overlapping capabilities and functions. The company is resizing its operations to ensure that resources better serve core businesses. In the first quarter of 2023, SWK generated pre-tax run rate savings of $230 million from the global cost reduction program. The company expects to generate run rate savings of $1 billion from this program in 2023. By 2025, Stanley Black expects run rate savings of $2 billion. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research SWK’s consistent measures to reward its shareholders through dividend payments are also likely to have boosted the stock. In the first three months of 2023, it paid dividends of $119.8 million to its shareholders, up 3% from the year-ago period. Stanley Black has been on track to buy back $4 billion worth of shares by 2023. It’s worth noting that in March 2022, the company initiated an accelerated share repurchase program, through which it repurchased shares worth $2.3 billion. SWK intends to buy back the remaining $1.7 billion worth of shares in 2023.Will the Uptrend in Shares Last?A reduction in raw material costs due to the deceleration in inflation is likely to support SWK’s performance in 2023. Stanley Black’s global cost-reduction program is also expected to aid its bottom line in the quarters ahead. Strategic investments in innovation engine, electrification and commercialization activation should also position the company well for sustainable growth and margin expansion.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderSWK currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

222,2c728e09-c2ec-3219-b3b1-f50fc4441875,NVDA,2023-06-08,NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) institutional investors lost 5.8% last week but have benefitted from longer-term gains,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-corporations-nasdaq-nvda-institutional-120016203.html,1686225616,STORY,['NVDA'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies NVIDIA's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions45% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders A look at the shareholders of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 67% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$57b last week. However, the 108% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of NVIDIA, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in NVIDIA. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of NVIDIA, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. NVIDIA is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.3% of shares outstanding. With 7.4% and 5.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and FMR LLC are the second and third largest shareholders. In addition, we found that Jen-Hsun Huang, the CEO has 3.5% of the shares allocated to their name.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of NVIDIAThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.We can report that insiders do own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$37b. we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 29% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over NVIDIA. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - NVIDIA has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

However, the company’s opioid-related litigation expenses are a potential threat.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 45% year to date compared with the industry’s 3.4% growth. The S&amp;P 500 Index has risen 12.5% in the same time frame.McKesson is a healthcare services and information technology company with a market capitalization of $53.6 billion. Its earnings are anticipated to improve 10.8% over the next five years.The company’s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same once, the average surprise being 4.48%. Its earnings yield of 6.7% compares favorably with the industry’s 4.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Backing MCK?McKesson continues to actively pursue deals, divestitures and acquisitions to drive growth. In April 2022, the company completed the divestiture of its retail and distribution businesses in the United Kingdom to Aurelius.During fiscal 2022, MCK completed the sale of its Austrian business to Quadrifolia management and the remaining share of its German joint venture to Walgreens Boots Alliance.Earlier this year, the company completed the divestiture of all of its European businesses. These divestitures will allow McKesson to focus on its key growth market — the United States.In June 2022, MCK formed a joint venture with HCA Healthcare HCA to create a fully integrated oncology research organization. Per the deal, McKesson and HCA will integrate their respective research units — U.S. Oncology Research (USOR) and Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI).The newly created entity, with the combined capabilities of SCRI and USOR, is expected to boost clinical research, ramp up drug development, lead to better data and analytic capabilities, and pave the way for a wider portfolio of clinical trials. The abovementioned deal was completed in October.Story continuesMcKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market. It stands to benefit from an increased generic utilization and inflation in generics, courtesy of an aging population and several patent expirations in the next few years.The Distribution Solutions segment caters to a wide range of customers and businesses.During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, McKesson’s growth was led by strong performance across all segments, except the International segment, which was marred by unfavorable currency movement. The divestiture of the company’s European business also hurt its growth.MCK removed a major overhang during the fiscal first quarter by signing a settlement deal related to the opioid-related claims of all 50 states, the District of Columbia and all eligible territories. These developments will close the long-pending litigations that have been hurting the company’s goodwill, as well as reduce the legal expenses.What’s Hurting the Stock?McKesson’s broad settlement of opioid-related claims of states and municipalities is likely to drive its short-term expenses. Per the settlement deal, the company had to pay up to approximately $7.4 billion to the Settling Governmental Entities.Estimates TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $275.73 billion, indicating a 4.5% increase from the previous year’s level. The same for adjusted earnings per share (EPS) is pinned at $25.93, implying a 9.5% improvement from the 2022 figure.McKesson Corporation PriceMcKesson Corporation PriceMcKesson Corporation price | McKesson Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderA couple of better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are Merit Medical Systems MMSI and West Pharmaceutical Services WST, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.27%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 4.19%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the engine maker had gained 0.82% over the past month. This has lagged the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's gain of 14.75% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.78% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Cummins as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $5.16, up 8.18% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $8.24 billion, up 25.11% from the year-ago period.CMI's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $19.79 per share and revenue of $32.81 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +30.89% and +16.87%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Cummins. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Cummins currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Cummins has a Forward P/E ratio of 11.26 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 11.16.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that CMI has a PEG ratio of 1.24. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.

Users will be able to watch movies and TV shows from Disney+, in addition to a more immersive sports viewing experience.Disney shares have since leveled off, but the positive move to the upside feeds into longstanding rumors surrounding a potential merger between the two companies.Martin explained how exclusive content will be key to driving sales of the new headset, referencing how Steve Jobs was able to secure iPod adoption by having music companies sell him individual songs.""Nobody would have bought an iPod unless there was content on it to drive adoption,"" she said. ""[The VR headset] isn't a massive product, so you have to have content that gets people to want to use it.""Martin emphasized the benefit to Apple would be securing, not only the IP, but also the storytellers.""You can't force Disney content makers to do anything unless you own them,"" she said, brushing off suggestions a partnership would suffice as opposed to full-blown ownership given Disney would want to protect its P&amp;L (profits and losses) and maximize revenue.Story continues""My idea would be it'd be exclusive to this one platform,"" she said, adding, ""It's worth more to Apple to have these storytellers and tell stories specifically for an iPhone or an iPad or a watch.""Apple CEO Tim Cook poses for photos in front of a pair of the company's new Apple Vision Pro headsets in a showroom on the Apple campus Monday, June 5, 2023, in Cupertino, Calif.

240,bd896255-eecc-36b6-a5fc-59bbefce8200,DIS,2023-06-08,Apple should buy Disney to grow the Vision Pro: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-needs-buy-disney-grow-153447906.html,1686152087,VIDEO,"['AAPL', 'DIS', 'WBD']","[Apple unveiled its new Vision Pro mixed reality headset at the company's WWDC event. It's $3,499 price tag however may turn off a lot of buyers. Laura Martin, Senior Media and Internet Analyst at Needham &amp; Co., however, has an idea. Martin suggests that Apple (AAPL) should buy Disney (DIS) to help build adoption of the new headset. Martin argues that Apple needs ""a compelling content storytelling use case"" for the Vision Pro to gain traction. She believes that with Disney's content, more people may be willing to purchase the headset.But what about the Disney parks? Martin says Apple likely won't want the parks, but that those could be spun off or sold, given they are ""really a good business, standalone.""Martin also covers Warner Bros Discovery (WBD). When asked about the ousting of CNN CEO Chris Licht, Martin says investors are betting more on WBD leadership than who is leading CNN. She also makes the case for WBD keeping CNN in its portfolio. ""The only way to win the streaming wars is you must have entertainment content, and you must have news, and you must have live sports,"" Martin says, because when news breaks, it drives viewers to your app.When it comes to the ongoing writers strike and a potential strike from SAG-AFTRA, Martin tells Yahoo Finance Live's Diane King Hall and Alexandra Canal that Wall Street investors will ultimately be the winners because ""all of these companies are not going to be able to spend money on content and that won't be a competitive disadvantage.""Key video moments00:00:21 Why Apple should buy Disney00:01:19 What to do with Disney Parks00:02:45 Reaction to CNN CEO stepping down00:04:42 Who will win from the writers strikeVideo TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: Apple's new Vision Pro mixed reality headset has been dominating the news this week. Getting pretty mixed reviews so far. But our next guest has an idea that could take the product to the next level. Joining us now is Laura Martin, Needham Senior Media Internet Analyst.Story continuesLaura, now, you said in a recent note that Apple buying Disney could boost adoption of the Vision Pro, what's the case for this?LAURA MARTIN: So the idea is that when, recall when Steve Jobs invented that thing called an iPod that no one had heard of. He put all the music on there, which gave it sort of a use case for consumers to buy the hardware. Similarly, we have a price point here with these massive, like ski goggle looking things of $3,500. I don't think that's going to be a mass product. They need to bring the product down, but they also need sort of a compelling content storytelling use case.And you can't make Disney storytellers do anything for 100,000 units or 200,000 units. So the only way to help that is to create content that's unique for this particular platform, which is what Apple's trying to create, is to actually own the Walt Disney Company and own the very competent storytellers of Marvel and Star Wars and Disney princesses and Pixar. And then have them make unique content for this new platform called Vision Pro Hi,ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hi, Laura, Allie Canal here. How do you view Apple though, tackling the park side of the business for Disney, especially since that's so heavily tied to its value? Is that something Apple could possibly want as well?LAURA MARTIN: I don't think so. I mean, I think you know investment bankers are calling on them. I think that could be spun off into a REIT or sold to a different company. Look, Saudi Arabia seems to be buying things these days. So maybe we sell the parts to Saudi Arabia or one of these big funds.But the point is, no, I don't think Apple wants the parks. But I think the parks are really a good business stand alone. So private equity or another kind of REIT, kind of real estate buyer would be a logical place for those.DIANE KING HALL: Laura, I got to ask you, though, about the regulatory landscape for an idea like this. I could see this getting pushed back. What's your thought on that?LAURA MARTIN: Well, we did have Amazon. It was able to buy MGM for about $10 billion. This would be larger obviously because Disney's trades at over $100 billion. But really, the way the laws are written here, it's not anti-competitive to have a hardware company or let's call it a distribution company own a content company. Remember Comcast bought NBC and a similarly size. They were almost equal size at the time.So, I mean, to me, it is possible the regulators would try to actually block it. But once you go to court, there are all the precedents allow content to be bought by distribution.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Laura, I want to switch gears here and talk about Warner Brothers Discovery because we just got the news this morning that Chris Licht is out as CEO of CNN. The stock was little changed immediately following the news. In fact, shares are up more than 3% right now. So what else would have to change in the CNN story for this to affect the stock price, since it seems like, right now at least, investors don't really care?LAURA MARTIN: You know, I think-- I think-- I think investors who own Warner Brothers Discovery are really betting on David Zaslav, the CEO, and John Malone is the head of strategy on the board. And that's, you know, which is about cost-cutting and figuring out the strategic relevance of news.And, you know, I think they-- I think investors aren't investing in specific division heads. Really, the two, you know, braintrust at the top need to figure out how to make this work. And so that's why people are buying shares.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Do you think CNN makes sense in the portfolio of Warner Brothers Discovery? And is it an entity that you think David Zaslav wants to continue to keep?LAURA MARTIN: I do. I think that the way-- the only way to win the streaming wars is you must have entertainment content and you must have news and you must have live sports. Why? Because the way you drive viewership is when something breaks in the world for news, it drives people to your app. And then you have the option to keep them there with your entertainment content.But if somebody is watching Netflix and there's suddenly the Ukraine war breaks out with Russia, everybody goes to news for two weeks. So they leave Netflix. So if Warner Brothers Discovery has a great news portal, they stay there. And that is consume entertainment content, which is sort of on the channel where CNN is.So yes, I think to win the streaming wars, you must own all genres of content in either to attract the next consumer or to retain the next consumer once they're watching your service.DIANE KING HALL: So, Laura, to your point about content and bringing back Disney back to the forefront of our conversation here, they say content is king. But all of the streamers have an issue in front of them, right? They're dealing with the writer's strike right now. And there is the very real threat of a possible SAG-AFTRA strike as well. What does that do to the content landscape for all of these streamers? Who's the winner in that?LAURA MARTIN: Wall Street, investors because what's going to happen is all of these companies are not going to be able to spend money on content and that won't be a competitive disadvantage. The streamers have been in an arms race throwing money at new content. The more of these guilds that go on strike, the longer these companies are not going to spend any money on content.Guess what happens to their reported earnings per share and their profitability. And they don't have to worry about competing with each other because no one has new content. So this is going to be great for investors and for the earnings per share and free cash flow. It's not a long-term solution because ultimately you need these guilds to go back to work. But in the near term, I expect earnings outperformance for the next 12 months.DIANE KING HALL: We will certainly see what happens with SAG-AFTRA already voting to approve a strike. So they're in the beginning of negotiations. We'll see how that turns out. Laura Martin, Needham Senior Media and Internet Analyst, our very on Allie Canal as well. Thank you so much to both of you.]"

Reports show climate change disproportionately impacts these communities and leaves residents more exposed to harmful air pollution.""As ComEd prepares for a decarbonized future, it’s important that families across the entire economic spectrum have equal access to climate-friendly programs that will help improve their quality of life,"" said Melissa Washington, senior vice president of customer operations and chief customer officer, ComEd. ""I’m proud of the way our three grantees have found creative ways to lift up families and businesses in under-resourced communities.""The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defines environmental justice as ""the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.""To help families and businesses in these communities lower and manage electric bills, PLCCA launched the Solar, Jobs and Justice program. The program partners with local nonprofit organizations to hire and train residents from these same communities to help educate community members on the benefits of – and help connect them to – solar energy. The transition can help decarbonize neighborhoods that tend to be the most impacted by high concentrations of air pollutants and other environmental concerns.Story continuesSince October 2022, PLCCA has used its grant to hire and train more than 30 solar ambassadors, designers and installers to educate home and business owners about rooftop and community solar programs, grants available to fund the installation of rooftop solar panels and, once qualified, assist with installations. Staff also provide education on the installation of electric vehicle charging equipment and energy-efficiency programs that can help manage energy use to lower energy bills.Representatives of PLCCA, which itself takes advantage of solar panels at its Maywood, Ill., headquarters, attend conferences or go door-to-door to assist families and businesses.""We are pleased with the success that our partnership with ComEd has thus far achieved in our community,"" said Bishop Dr. Claude Porter, PLCCA president and CEO. ""Not only have we created good-paying jobs and career opportunities in the growing field of renewable energy, but we have begun to educate families and businesses about the environmental benefits of carbon-free energy. We are very excited about the interest and positive responses we have received.""Other Grant RecipientsSince the launch of ComEd’s year-long Climate Friendly Nonprofit Grant Program in 2022, two other area nonprofits are making progress on their efforts to increase access to solar and other sources of climate-friendly energy.Community Investment Corporation (CIC): With its $450,000 grant, CIC identified 17 multi-family buildings within Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood as prospective recipients of climate-friendly upgrades. CIC is now in the process of evaluating ways to implement these upgrades to help make housing units more eco-friendly, while improving the quality of life for the low- and moderate-income tenants living in these buildings.Equiticity: With its nearly $450,000 grant, Equiticity established the Mobility Opportunities Fund, a first-of-its kind program that provides education and stipends to help low- and moderate-income residents of Chicago’s North Lawndale neighborhood purchase climate-friendly transportation, including conventional bicycles, including conventional bicycles, electric bikes, electric cargo bikes and electric vehicles.Equiticity offered individual stipends of $350 for a conventional bike, $750 for an e-bike, $1,500 for an electric cargo bike and $8,750 for an electric vehicle. Recipients of stipends for electric modes of transportation also receive training on mechanics and safety. To date, Equiticity allocated stipends for more than 100 bikes, 75 e-bikes, 50 e-cargo bikes and 25 electric vehicles.To create awareness of the stipends and assist residents with the application process, Equiticity has so far held four application events across North Lawndale. The organization also provides no- to low-cost repair services for bikes and e-bikes. Equiticity trains students who are part of its education programs to perform these services.ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 200 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) share price is up 80% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 45% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 12% , including dividends .After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Nasdaq While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Nasdaq achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 9.5% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Nasdaq's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Nasdaq's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Nasdaq's TSR for the last 5 years was 95%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Nasdaq shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 12% over the last year. That's including the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 14% per year, is even more impressive. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Nasdaq better, we need to consider many other factors.

251,dc8233e2-f817-3a2a-a114-35abd1879ec0,PRU,2023-06-08,"Rethinking retirement: Gen X has 'significantly under-saved', according to new survey",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rethinking-retirement-gen-x-significantly-145721361.html,1686149841,VIDEO,['PRU'],"[Gen X is getting closer to retirement age, but many of them are underprepared for that next phase of their lives. Prudential Vice Chair Rob Falzon joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the results of a new Prudential survey that shows why Gen X may need to rethink their retirement plans.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Retirement will look different for Gen X-- economic uncertainty, inflation, declining pension plans, and Social Security facing a shrinking trust fund, it's redefining the retirement experience. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average retiree in the US needs $4,350 to cover monthly expenses. With Social Security payments averaging $1,830, there is a sizable gap between those two. The Gen X is going to need to fund themselves and many aren't prepared.A report out this morning from Prudential shows 67% of Gen X-ers have no retirement strategy and 19% of those folks are not saving at all. Rob Falzon is the vise chair of Prudential Financial. He joins us now with an exclusive check of Gen X-ers' retirement plans.This hits home for me, Rob. I'm in that cohort. I'm a Gen X-er. These are pretty sobering statistics. And there is still time for people within Gen X to catch up during their working years, but not a heck of a lot. What stood out to you from these findings?ROB FALZON: Well, the first thing that stood out is this is the tip of the spear in terms of this is the first generation where the significant majority of the generation is heading into retirement without a defined benefits plan. Instead, they switched over to a defined contribution plan.And as a society, we haven't done a very good job at educating these individuals on what level of assets and composition of assets are going to be required in order to generate a sustainable income through retirement. And so there's a disconnect there, a lack of education, a lack of understanding, and a significantly undersaved population heading into retirement.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: And so for a lot of Gen X as well that has seen the market turn multiple times at this point, for the savings that they've put into their retirement that are pegged to the stock market, how do you go about even starting to advise on where they could potentially make sure that they are better positioned regardless of what the equity markets and savings there may do?ROB FALZON: So that gets into having a retirement strategy. A quarter retirement strategy is what level of assets and composition, Brad, to your point, do you need at different points in your life. So those-- the earlier end of the Gen X still has time to accumulate savings. And so if you think about equity returns over longer periods of time, probably very appropriate to be more skewed toward getting equities and seeing the returns associated with those.As you're getting nearer to retirement obviously, de-risking of that portfolio in order to ensure that a downdraft in the market doesn't put your retirement security at risk. And then there are solutions around guaranteed income associated with pools of assets like annuitization otherwise that individuals can undertake in order to get to take that market risk out of their own plans and lay it off to a financial provider.JULIE HYMAN: Rob, I also want to talk a little bit more about that gap between what people are going to get from Social Security and what they need to live. Because also in the survey, you found 58% expect to rely on Social Security as their primary source of income.But by the time Gen X-ers get to prime retirement age, which will be around, what, 2033, Social Security isn't going to be paying out 100% of benefits, right? It's estimated it could be something like 77% of benefits. So how do people deal with that uncertainty and filling that gap?ROB FALZON: Well, the gap is large. If you look at the statistics, as you put up the $2,500 per month, gap between average expenses and today's typical Social Security payout on average, that translates into a level of savings to replace that gap, to fill that gap, would require a level of savings that's depending on mortality and returns. And also, it's going to be it's going to be $300,000 or $400,000 that someone would have to have in order to be able to fill that gap. And a third of Gen X has got $10,000 or less saved. So there's a big delta there.And I think a number of levers individuals would have to pull as a part of that retirement strategy. One is increasing savings today, so a change in lifestyle today in order to be able to preserve a lifestyle post-retirement. And then also, a reset of expectations as to the level of spending and lifestyle that you're going to have in retirement.One of the other things that the survey came out with that I thought was quite interesting was that more than half the surveyed population expects to extend their retirement date. And 10% expect never to be able to retire. 40% expect to be working part-time after retirement. I don't know if that qualifies as retirement if you're still working part-time post that date. But those are the sorts of actions that I think individuals are going to have to be contemplating.BRAD SMITH: I mean, even I plan on picking up a little part-time job at a golf course somewhere. I mean, start a Ranger.ROB FALZON: It's not going to be about the golf, Brad. I do not have a view.BRAD SMITH: Let's go. That's cool. We'll stay away from it today. But while we've got you, Rob, I mean, even as we think about some of the roles and how the employment situation is changing, how people are being compensated, and where that skills gap is, what are the biggest considerations as people are preparing for retirement and the reality of the labor market demand for some of those highest paying jobs?ROB FALZON: Yeah. You know, so there's an interesting intersection of individuals are indicating they need to work longer in order to be able to get to sort of a level of retirement savings. Yet, over half the surveyed population indicated some job insecurity, concern about the security of their job. Number one on that was the economy-- economic outlook and what that might do to their job security.But behind that were things around being replaced by other workers-- younger workers, cheaper workers, et cetera. When you dig below that, Brad, but I think that's saying is they're concerned about technology and skills that are required in what the work of future is going to look like. And so as individuals are thinking about extending their work life, they're going to need to think about how they invest in re- and upskilling in order to remain relevant to the workplace.And today, we have a gap. There's a reason there's a gap between positions that are open and positions that are filled. Much of that has to do with the reality that the skills needed for many of the positions as the economy is advancing with AI and other technology advancements, the skills are not there in the marketplace.And so there's this high demand for certain skill level that doesn't exist. Individuals are going to have to figure out how they train themselves in order to position themselves to fill those jobs or at least have the skills that are required to maintain their jobs as they look to extend that retirement date.JULIE HYMAN: Well, all of this is hopefully an important wake up call for people. But we'll see what happens. Rob Falzon, it's always great to speak with you. Thanks for spending some time with us this morning. Prudential Financial Vice Chair, thanks.]"

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230607005041/en/Rob Falzon, Vice Chair, Prudential (Photo: Business Wire)Key findings of the survey include:Nest egg empty. Up to 30 million (46%) Gen Xers do not think they will have enough saved to live comfortably in retirement. Those fears reflect Gen X’s savings reality: 35% have less than $10,000 saved, and 18% — reflecting up to 12 million Gen Xers — have nothing saved.Delaying retirement. Almost half (47%) of all working Gen Xers expect to retire later than anticipated. Forty percent plan to work part-time after retirement.Won’t bet the house. Only 16% of Gen X plan to use their home value to help fund retirement. Most of Gen X are not planning to follow in the footsteps of baby boomers, who are tapping into record home equity and currently make up the highest share of buyers and sellers nationwide.1Not flying south. Approximately two-thirds (65%) of Gen X plan to stay in one city or town in retirement. Only 15% plan to split time between locations.Disrupting the ""Great Wealth Transfer."" A mere 12% say an inheritance will be a source of retirement income, even as boomers are expected to pass down over $70 trillion.2 What’s more, 84% of Gen Xers are not planning to leave an inheritance.""Gen X faces one of the most complex landscapes for retirement readiness in decades, including the decline of defined benefit pension plans which supported prior generations’ retirement, as well as significant uncertainty about the economy and long-term Social Security benefits,"" said Prudential Vice Chair Rob Falzon. ""This data underscores how important it is for Gen X to adopt a new set of retirement strategies designed to protect and grow their savings, and, when possible, translate their assets into reliable sources of future income.""Story continuesAdditional retirement obstacles identified in the surveyGen X is facing complex situations not seen by previous generations. At the same time, they are not currently following a retirement strategy, saving enough, or accounting for long-term expenses and situations.Social Security … not so secure. Despite projections that Social Security trust fund reserves could be depleted by 2033,3 58% of Gen X say they will rely on it as a source of retirement income.Pensions in the past. Only 20% of Gen X plan to use pensions as a source of retirement income, and only 11% will mostly rely on a pension. This reflects the known steep decline in the number of pension plans, which fell by 73% between 1985 and 2020.4Saving without a plan. Almost half (48%) are saving, but don’t have a plan.Inflation. More than two-thirds (68%) of working Gen Xers are concerned about reaching their savings goals due to inflation, and nearly three-quarters (72%) of all Gen Xers say the current environment makes it hard to plan beyond day-to-day.Work worries. While an economic downturn still ranks as the biggest threat to job security among working Gen Xers (35%), fears of being replaced by younger (29%) and less expensive (26%) workers are close behind.Critical expenses overlooked. Nearly two-fifths (38%) are not factoring in healthcare costs, and three-quarters (75%) are not accounting for assisted living expenses.""Gen Xers are contemplating significantly different approaches than prior generations to achieve retirement security,"" said Dylan Tyson, president, Prudential Retirement Strategies. ""Together, we must find ways to incorporate the fundamental best practices of traditional pensions into today’s defined contribution–based retirement system. Strategies like protected accumulation and protected income planning are required to help Gen Xers avoid the potential hazards of longevity risk and market volatility on otherwise well-balanced financial plans.""To learn more about potential retirement strategies and solutions, click here.ABOUT THE PRUDENTIAL PULSE SURVEY – GEN X: RETIREMENT REVISEDThe Prudential Pulse survey was conducted on behalf of Prudential by Brunswick Group from March 31 to April 6, 2023, among 2,000 pre-retiree Gen Xers in the United States.

Richard Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn cited a report from Forbes that said TikTok had stored financial information of U.S. content creators who get paid by the company – including their Social Security numbers and tax IDs - on China-based servers.The senators also cited another report from The New York Times, published in late May, that said TikTok employees regularly shared user information, such as driver’s licenses information of some American users, on an internal messaging app called Lark that employees from TikTok’s Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, could easily access.Forbes first reported Wednesday on the letter.TikTok spokesperson Alex Haurek said, ""“We are reviewing the letter. We remain confident in the accuracy of our testimony and responses to Congress.”TikTok has said servers that contain U.S. user data have been physically stored in Virginia and Singapore, where its headquartered. But who can access that data - and from where - is an ongoing question.Chew, the company's CEO, said at a congressional hearing in March that access to the data was provided “as-required” to engineers globally for business purposes. He also said some ByteDance employees still maintained access to some U.S. user data, but that would end once Project Texas - the company's plan to siphon off U.S. user data from China - was completed.The popular social media app has been under scrutiny from Western governments, who’ve been wary of the company’s Chinese ownership and have prohibited its use on government issued devices. Earlier this year, the Biden administration threated to ban the platform nationwide if the company’s Chinese owners don’t sell their stakes.Story continuesTo assuage concerns from U.S. lawmakers, TikTok has been touting its Project Texas plan to store U.S. user data on servers owned and maintained by the software giant Oracle. Last year, the company said it began directing all U.S. user traffic to those servers but also continued to back up data on its own servers.Chew said the company began deleting all historic U.S. user data from non-Oracle servers in March, and the process expected to be completed this year.In their letter, the senators also said the recent news reports appear to contradict testimonies from another TikTok official about where U.S. user data is stored.]"

The total value of chip imports fell 24.2 per cent to US$131.9 billion in the five-month period.In contrast, in the same period in 2022, the total volume of China's chip imports dropped 10.9 per cent year on year to 232.1 billion units, while the total value increased 9.1 per cent amid a global chip shortage at that time.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.For January to May this year, IC exports fell 11.7 per cent year on year to 103.4 billion units, while the total value of chip exports declined 17.2 per cent.The downward trend in trade data comes amid increasing efforts by the US to restrict China's access to advanced chips and chip-making equipment, especially from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which are key players in the global chip supply chain. Meanwhile, a US-initiated Chip 4 Alliance - which includes South Korea, Japan and Taiwan - is coming into shape.China's total imports from South Korea plunged 26.7 per cent in the first five months, continuing the trend in the first four month, marking the steepest drop among China's major trade partners, according to Chinese customs data. Imports from Japan and Taiwan slumped 17.6 per cent and 26.2 per cent, respectively. In comparison, China's total imports fell just 6.7 per cent in the same period.Story continuesThe decline in chip imports could continue given current headwinds. In May, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry released a new set of export restrictions on 23 types of chip-related equipment and materials, which will come into effect in July, which follows a reported agreement between the US and the Netherlands to limit the export of advanced chip-making equipment to China.Although Tokyo did not explicitly reference China in the new rules, analysts said they represent a de facto ban similar to the US export curbs announced in October 2022, which dealt a heavy blow to China's ability to produce advanced chips beyond the 14-nanometre process node.Separately, Washington asked Seoul to press the country's memory chip makers to not fill any market gaps in China from Beijing's ban on the sale of some Micron Technology memory chips on the mainland after a national security probe, the Financial Times reported.A person leaves a building housing the Shanghai offices of US memory chip maker Micron. Photo: AFP alt=A person leaves a building housing the Shanghai offices of US memory chip maker Micron. Photo: AFP&gt;The global semiconductor market is still grappling with a cyclical downturn exacerbated by macroeconomic headwinds. In April, the chip industry saw its total sales drop 21.6 per cent year on year to US$40.0 billion, according to data released on Tuesday by the US-based Semiconductor Industry Association.However, China's domestic chip output is seeing a recovery, as Beijing continues to offer preferential policies and financial support for its domestic chip supply chain under a ""whole-nation"" approach. In April, China's IC output increased 3.8 per cent year on year to 28.1 billion units, marking the first monthly uptick in 16 months, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

The company acquired failed First Republic Bank for $10.6 billion, which is expected to be accretive to earnings. The deal adds almost $173 billion in loans and will increase market share among wealthy clients.Higher rates, global expansion initiatives and a steady loan demand will support net interest income (NII). Yet, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and higher mortgage rates are likely to make fee income growth challenging.Mounting expenses pose a major headwind, and we anticipate the same to rise 6.8% in 2023. Nevertheless, supported by solid earnings strength, the company will be able to sustain enhanced capital deployments.(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here &gt;&gt;&gt;)McDonald's shares have lagged the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry (+14.1% vs. +20.7%), but have handily outperformed the broader market (+14.1% vs. +3.2% for the S&amp;P 500 index). The company's upside is fueled by strong comps performance, digital initiatives, marketing campaigns and loyalty programs.McDonald's is increasing its focus on menu innovation, as it believes that the strengthening of the core menu, solid marketing and improved pricing are likely to pave the way for additional growth in the upcoming periods.McDonald is also undertaking efforts to drive growth in international markets. Robust digitalization is likely to help the company support long-term growth. Earnings estimates for 2023 have moved north in the past 30 days, depicting analysts' optimism over the stock's growth prospects.(You can read the full research report on McDonald's here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Comcast have outperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry over the past six months (+16.4% vs. +2.6%). The company is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base as witnessed in the first quarter of 2023. Broadband user base increased in the reported quarter. Comcast's plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is noteworthy.The technology will help it in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors. Recovery in park and movie business bodes well for Comcast's profitability. Its streaming service Peacock is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales.

269,86bdba03-0979-3e77-949b-6af20c0f255e,PLD,2023-06-08,Surging investment in Mexican logistics warehouses only the ‘first wave’,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/surging-investment-mexican-logistics-warehouses-193635156.html,1686166595,STORY,['PLD'],"[Nearshoring in Mexico is just ramping up, according to a Prologis report. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Logistics real estate operator Prologis said it is seeing markets tighten significantly in Mexico as companies advance supply chain initiatives and move manufacturing closer to the end user.A Tuesday report on nearshoring showed net absorption — the amount of space that became occupied minus the space that became vacant — in Mexico’s six major markets doubled from 2019 to 2022. Vacancy in those regions fell to just 1.1% in the 2023 first quarter after averaging 6% in the years heading into the pandemic. Further, of all the sites under construction currently, 60% have been pre-leased compared to just 36% in 2019.The trends resulted in a 16% jump in rents last year. Prologis’ (NYSE: PLD) research unit expects rents in the country to see another double-digit increase this year.Citing location, free trade agreements, pro-North American regulations and favorable labor dynamics, Prologis said the recent allocation of investments in Mexico is just the “first wave.”“We expect this movement to play out over decades as local economies build a critical mass of infrastructure, expertise and suppliers. This will not be limited to the already strong auto sector; we also expect electronics to take a larger role in Mexican exports,” the report said.The report pointed to machinery imports and net absorption of industrial space as supportive of more manufacturing capacity being added in the country.Inflation-adjusted imports of machinery into Mexico increased to $152 billion last year, which was more than 70% higher than the average annual level recorded in the seven years prior to the pandemic.Nearly three-quarters of space leased or newly occupied in Mexico last year involved nearshoring-related tenants (manufacturers, suppliers and 3PLs). That group totaled just 40% of absorption in 2019.Absorption of manufacturing space being used to supply goods to the U.S. accounted for just 8% of the country’s total in 2019, but jumped to 26% of total space in 2022. Over the same time, absorption of space used by the suppliers and 3PLs to support those sites nearly doubled to 29 million square feet, representing almost half of the country’s new activity.Story continuesPrologis estimates that every $1 billion invested into auto factories in Mexico generates an incremental need for 5 million to 10 million square feet of logistics space. It pointed to the Bajio region, where demand for logistics sites jumped fourfold from 2014 to 2017 as multiple automobile producers added assembly sites in the market.Prologis said Tesla’s new facility in Monterrey, Mexico, which has a price tag ranging from $5 billion to $8 billion, could require 25 million square feet of logistics space to service it.“Given Mexico’s advantages of location, free trade and labor, we expect further investments to continue to drive logistics real estate demand because it takes time for supply chains to pivot in response to changing cost and regulatory frameworks,” the report said.More FreightWaves articles by Todd MaidenYellow, Teamsters point fingers; parties still far apart on dealXPO’s tonnage dips again in May, inflects higher from Q1Transportation prices fall at fastest-ever pace in MayMultiple market gain market share in 2023The post Surging investment in Mexican logistics warehouses only the ‘first wave’ appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

It only authorizes union leaders to call a strike if deemed necessary.According to the dissident group Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a yes vote gives the union more leverage at the bargaining table, while a no vote would destroy its ability to win a fair contract because the company will feel there will be no opposition to a contract proposal.The post Teamsters to begin process to authorize leaders to strike UPS appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

The company’s commitment to return capital to shareholders and upbeat fiscal 2024 view spark confidence.However, commodity cost inflation is expected to weigh on gross margins. Supply-chain disruptions and tough labor market will play spoilsports. Unfavorable foreign currency translations and high R&amp;D expenses are also likely to limit profits.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for American Express American Express Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Monique Herena, for US$2.6m worth of shares, at about US$173 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$172. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Over the last year we saw more insider selling of American Express shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).American Express Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of American Express shares. In total, insider Howard Grosfield dumped US$952k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. American Express insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$173m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About American Express Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. Therefore, you should definitely take a look at this FREE report showing analyst forecasts for American Express.Of course American Express may not be the best stock to buy.

TDC.Industry: Computer StorageLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2104276/3-storage-devices-stocks-to-watch-for-in-a-challenging-industryThe Zacks Computer-Storage Devices industry benefits from encouraging trends in PC shipments and the solid momentum in cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), auto, connected devices, virtual reality and Artificial Intelligence (AI). These factors propel the demand for robust data storage solutions, bolstering the requirement for computer storage products. These factors are favorable for prominent industry players like NetApp, Pure Storage and Teradata Corp..The democratization of higher internal memory smartphones, faster Internet speed and 5G is likely to act as a tailwind for industry participants. The rapid deployment of 5G networking is driving the proliferation of IoT, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices. However, cautious IT spending amid global macroeconomic turbulence is a major headwind in the near term along with volatile supply chain dynamics, inflation and component shortages.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer-Storage Devices industry houses companies that design, develop, manufacture and market various hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). These drives are utilized in PCs, laptops, mobiles, servers, network-attached storage (NAS) devices, video game consoles, digital video recorders and other consumer electronic devices. A few industry participants, including Pure Storage, provide software-defined all-flash solutions that are uniquely fast and cloud-capable for customers.Many industry players offer high-performance modular memory subsystems, mount and blade server systems, enterprise storage and data management software and hardware products and services. Some industry participants also provide purpose-built servers for storing and accessing data over a shared network or the Internet.Story continues4 Trends Shaping the Computer - Storage Industry's FutureNew Normal Trends &amp; Rapid Implementation of 5G Opening New Business Avenues: Implementation of hybrid work models have triggered the demand for data-intensive applications like video conferencing and cloud services. Effective storage is essential for harnessing data and is expected to raise demand for high-storage capable SSDs and internal memory in advanced smartphones. The accelerated deployment of 5G and rebound in the smartphone market will likely propel the industry to newer heights. Extensive implementation of cloud computing solutions, increased Internet usage and rapidly-growing media and regulatory compliance have led to a data explosion for enterprises.Innovation in Cloud Storage Technologies to Drive Adoption: broader storage options from collocated hardware (such as hard disks and tape drives) to many cloud storage solutions have put the industry on a growth trajectory. The industry players are well poised for growth on the back of a rapid increase in the amount of data, the complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals.These companies rely on Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) and machine learning (ML) to manage and optimize storage solutions. To streamline data storage, companies are relying on virtualization technologies. As more data is amassed from IoT, companies are turning to edge computing architecture to reduce latency and boost flexibility. Kubernetes storage is becoming increasingly popular as it facilitates greater agility and scalability. This has bolstered the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products, which is a positive for industry players.Macro Headwinds May Prove a Drag on IT Spending in the Near Term: Weakening IT spending amid global macroeconomic weakness is likely to remain a headwind in the near term. Increased budget scrutiny, especially cloud-cost optimization by clients and forex volatility, are affecting top-line performance of the industry participants. Consumer spending cuts on the purchase of PCs, tablets and printers are likely to hinder IT spending growth. In the long run, higher technology spending on transformation projects including data security, application modernization, analytics and AI by enterprises augurs well for industry participants.Slowing Momentum in PC Shipments Might Hinder Growth Prospects: Worldwide PC shipments declined 30% to 55.2 million units in the first quarter of 2023, according to the data compiled by Gartner. Sales were affected by a huge inventory pile-up amid a slump in demand. Intense promotional activity by vendors to clear inventory was another headwind.

(TMO) is gaining investors’ confidence, backed by the performance of the company’s end markets. Through the proven growth strategy powered by the PPI (Practical Process Improvement) Business System, Thermo Fisher continued to deliver differentiated performance in the first quarter.Thermo Fisher’s clinical research business, PPD, also had a very strong start to the year, as it continues to benefit from revenue synergies. However, weak solvency and a competitive landscape are worrisome.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 6.3% against the 2.6% rise of the industry and a 6% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical and laboratory equipment provider has a market capitalization of $200.03 billion.

The company is implementing aggressive price actions across its businesses to counter higher raw material and non-material inflation.Continued strong recovery in price and costs across most of its businesses, benefits from the Ball Metalpack (now Sonoco Metal Packaging) acquisition, and solid demand are likely to contribute to the 2023 results.Sonoco’s focus on optimizing businesses through productivity improvement, standardization and cost control will also aid its results in the near term. It is implementing several synergy opportunities, including optimizing raw material purchases, leveraging indirect expenses, and coordinating supply-chain logistics.These factors will help meet Sonoco’s cost-saving target.Focus on Growth &amp; Innovation to Aid ResultsSonoco is focused on increasing investment in its core consumer and industrial businesses, and expects to achieve an annual EBITDA of $1 billion by 2026.The company emphasizes capital allocation and expects to be able to increase dividends, while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet. It intends to increase returns on invested capital in the coming years through organic investments in core accretive acquisitions and portfolio rationalization.Moreover, Sonoco is focused on growing in niche food markets and launching products with new customers. Investment in these markets will add pouch-making capacity for the company and help it expand its presence in the pouch market.Story continuesAcquisitions Bode WellOn Jan 22, 2022, Sonoco completed the acquisition of Ball Metalpack for a cash payment of $1.35 billion. Ball Metalpack is a foremost producer of sustainable metal packaging for food and household products and the largest manufacturer of aerosol products in North America.The deal supports Sonoco’s focus on investing in the core business that strengthens its global Paper Cans and Closures business, while bolstering its sustainable packaging portfolio with metal packaging.Sonoco expects to realize tax benefits of $180 million from the deal. It expects to generate annual synergies of at least $20 million from procurement and SG&amp;A savings within three years of the transaction.In fourth-quarter 2022, Sonoco acquired Denmark-based Skjern, a privately owned manufacturer of paper, for $88 million in cash. The acquisition expands SON’s production capacity and help it capitalize on the growing market for sustainable paper and packaging products in Europe.High Costs &amp; Supply Issues Continue to Hurt MarginsSonoco will continue to bear the brunt of raw material, energy and freight cost pressures, and the impacts of supply-chain disruptions. Sonoco’s bottom line is impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation and divestitures.These are likely to persist and dent the company’s results in the upcoming quarters.

As with all investments, you can only get out what you put in; reaching a million will take time. That said, the three names below can help you in your journey toward millionaire status.The market is again in flux. Lots of investors have realized strong returns in tech in 2023. Those who invested heavily in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other AI-linked shares are surely happy after Nvidia’s strong performance and outlook. While bigger names remain inherently interesting, investors should consider the undervalued and underappreciated shares below.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKellogg’s (K)Kellogg's sign on their Canada's head office building in MississaugaSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comKellogg’s (NYSE:K) stock currently offers a lot of shareholder upside based on its planned strategy to divide the business in two. The company, long known as a cereal giant, is shedding legacy branding to reinvent itself and provide valuable returns.Specifically, Kellogg’s is planning to sell its North American cereals business at some point in 2023.Kellogg is focusing on its snacking business, which includes Cheez-Its, Pringles, and Pop-Tarts, and snacking in general. Snaking has held very strong in 2023 and has been an area in which consumer demand has yet to soften.Kellogg will also retain its plant-based foods business and its international cereal business. Slow-growing U.S. cereals are out, and chasing sales growth is in. That means high margins associated with those legacy cereal brands will be lost. But higher valuation multiples will now be in play for firms like Mondelez International (NYSE:MDLZ). In fact, Mondelez clearly inspired Kellogg’s move here. The company successfully executed the exact strategy Kellogg is now undertaking.Growth and the valuations associated with it are prompting the move. Mondelez has shown how fruitful the strategy can be.Story continuesSplunk (SPLK)Splunk (SPLK) logo on the company office in Santana Row.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comSplunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) remains an undervalued tech stock that can create gains for those willing to invest. It makes software utilized by companies seeking to search, analyze, and monitor machine-generated data. In other words, Splunk provides services that should continue to have a long runway as AI is just starting to take off.Revenues jumped by 11% in the most recent reporting period and were higher than what analysts anticipated. That indicates that Splunk is catching the leading edge of trending business. EPS figures were similarly surprising. Splunk also made a lot of cash in the quarter, with free cash flow hitting $486 million, up 253% year-over-year. The company can pivot toward real growth if it chooses to do so because of that cash.Shares continue to trade below $100 even as average target prices are nearer $120 and have been since the earnings release.Crown Castle (CCI)Image of Crown Castle (CCI) logo on a web browser highlighted through the lens of a magnifying glassSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comCrown Castle (NYSE:CCI) stock should continue to grow with the adoption of 5G and increased communications penetration. Its portfolio includes over 40,000 cell towers and 85,000 miles of fiber overall.It’s also a company with a low price that analysts don’t believe will stay low for long. Shares trade at $112, but Wall Street expects CCI stock will trade at $150 over the mid-term. Fundamentals screener site Gurufocus places that target price a much higher $194. In short, there is an overall consensus view that Crown Castle can make investors quite a bit of money.The other strong news is that Crown Castle’s Jan. 25 outlook remains unchanged after its April earnings report. Analysts’ earlier strong backing of CCI stock then should continue to be strong.Right now, Crown Castle’s site rental revenues are growing modestly. But as 5G takes deeper root, those revenues can increase substantially. That’s why there continues to be such a high upside in CCI overall.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

ISRG is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strength in robotics. The optimism led by solid first-quarter 2023 and its progress on the artificial intelligence (AI) front is expected to contribute further. The risk of procedure adoption and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 41.6% compared with the 2.3% rise of the industry and the S&amp;P 500’s 4.5% growth.The renowned provider of minimally invasive care and the pioneer of robotic-assisted surgery has a market capitalization of $110.63 billion. It projects 13% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Intuitive Surgical’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other two, with the average earnings surprise being 1.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strength in Robotics: We are upbeat about Intuitive Surgical’s robot-based da Vinci surgical system that enables minimally-invasive surgery and reduces the trauma associated with open surgery. The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology that has provided the company with solid exposure to medical mechatronics, robotics and AI for the healthcare space.Per the first-quarter 2023 earnings call in April, the installed base of da Vinci systems grew approximately 12% year over year. The utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, was up 13% from the prior-year quarter.Progress on the AI Front: We are upbeat about the growing adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, the use of information technology for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model. These indicate the high prevalence of AI in the MedTech space.Per Intuitive Surgical’s management, the rise of medical mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging has enabled new approaches to old problems. AI has been enhancing Intuitive Surgical’s product portfolio with clinical applications, diagnostic support, operational efficiency, electronic health record systems, practice workflows and supply chain management.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: Intuitive Surgical’s solid first-quarter 2023 results buoy our optimism. The company witnessed continued growth in da Vinci procedure volume.DownsidesRisk of Procedure Adoption: Intuitive Surgical faces the risk of adoption of its procedures. This is because adoption growth takes time, as each procedure needs to gain credibility. Furthermore, the wide use of the company’s products requires the training of surgical teams. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete such training.Stiff Competition: Intuitive Surgical used to enjoy a monopoly in the market for robots used in abdominal surgery since the launch of its flagship device, the da Vinci System, in 2000. However, after the regulatory approval of Transenterix's surgical robot for abdominal surgery in 2017, competition for Intuitive Surgical intensified.Estimate TrendIntuitive Surgical is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 3.8% north to $5.47.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.73 billion, suggesting a 13.8% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comThanks to the AI boom, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been smoking hot. So far, year to date, the tech stock is up 170% and just became a trillion-dollar company. Even better, the company announced blowout first-quarter earnings and provided forward guidance that was 50% greater than Wall Street forecasts.With AI continuing to capture investor attention, there’s no telling how high NVDA stock could go. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) recently revised its price target on Nvidia to $500 a share, one of many analysts to mark up their targets on the stock. In addition, Nvidia just unveiled a host of new AI products, including a new chip that turbocharges the speed of information within data centers, and an AI supercomputer called “DGX GH200” that will help technology companies create successors to chatbots such as ChatGPT.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMeta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comAnother hot tech stock is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). The parent company of Facebook has seen its stock march higher since it launched its “year of efficiency” and got serious about controlling costs. In the last five months, META stock has more than doubled its share price, rising a total of 110%. The stock has also enjoyed some residual bounce from its growing association with AI.In addition to eliminating 21,000 jobs, Meta has begun to pivot towards new AI technologies, while also shoring up its core social media platforms that also include WhatsApp and Instagram, and the digital advertising that comes with them. And so far, the strategy appears to be paying off judging by the way the stock has risen year to date. Plus, with online advertising making a comeback, there are reasons to believe that META stock has more room to run.Story continuesMonero (XMR-USD)A concept coin for Monero (XMR) has a sparkly gold backgroundSource: ShutterstockAlso making this list of the hottest stocks and cryptos to buy is Monero (XMR-USD). Known as a privacy coin, XMR allows users to carry out transactions on its blockchain. All of which are anonymous and untraceable. In addition, Monero can mask from view the sender, recipient, and amount of a transaction. The anonymity provided by Monero has made this crypto extremely popular. Consequently, XMR’s price has gained 5% in the last six months. Since its inception in 2017, XMR has grown 72%.In addition, Monero, which operates under the motto: “secure, private, untraceable,” has drawn some criticism from regulators and lawmakers for the strict level of privacy it provides. XMR has been accused of facilitating illegal activities, mostly money laundering. Granted, some users fret about the regulation of the coin. However, most seem unconcerned and content to take advantage of the privacy offered by XMR.C3.ai (AI)Graphic of letters ""AI"" in bold font surrounded by circle of tech symbols in purple and blue against a dark backgroundSource: shutterstock.com/Tex vectorAnother hot AI stock is C3.ai (NYSE:AI).  Year to date, the AI stock is up 257%, making it one of the year’s hottest stocks. All thanks to the AI hype. However, some analysts are questioning whether the run-up in C3.ai’s stock is justified. In fact, some argue it could be overvalued, given its annual revenues of about $200 million.In addition, some skeptics have even raised the possibility that AI stock is being treated as a meme stock by retail investors who have targeted the shares for a short squeeze. The idea of a short squeeze is certainly plausible given that AI stock is heavily shorted. Regardless of the reason, there’s no denying that C3.ai is a hot stock right now and will continue riding the AI story.Bitcoin (BTC-USD)Up trend Technical graph of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) in futuristic concept, BITI ETF is a Bitcoin short fund for investors betting against Bitcoin.Source: Sittipong Phokawattana / Shutterstock.comThe price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) slipped over concerns about the U.S. debt ceiling. However, since Jan., Bitcoin’s price has gained 63%, defying even the most optimistic forecasts for the digital asset. Last Dec., Bitcoin was trading below $16,000 and many analysts said the price would fall to $10,000 or lower in a chilly crypto winter.Fast forward six months, and the crypto winter has thawed, with most major digital coins and tokens up on the year. The total market cap of cryptocurrencies is now back above $1 trillion, and the total trading volume of cryptocurrencies regularly exceeds $30 billion U.S. every 24 hours. Crypto assets have gotten a lift from the implosion of several mainstream banks in the U.S. and Europe this spring, as well as investors getting their risk appetite back with the U.S. Federal Reserve pausing its interest rate hikes.Palo Alto Networks (PANW)a business man pressing a button with an open lock on it that's connected to a symbol of a cloud and various security related iconsSource: ShutterstockPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) has been leading cybersecurity stocks higher.

All of these estimates currently exceed Wall Street expectations. Additionally, Palo Alto Networks forecast that its free cash flow margin will climb 37.5% to 38.5% higher in fiscal 2023, compared to 33.3% growth in the previous fiscal year.Capital One (COF)a pile of credit cardsSource: Teerasak Ladnongkhun/Shutterstock.comA lot of prominent investors are liking Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF) these days. The latest 13F regulatory filings revealed that both Warren Buffett and Michael Burry of The Big Short fame opened new positions in COF stock during Q1. What do these two influential investors see in the bank and credit card issuer? Most likely a favorable valuation and strong dividend. Right now, Capital One’s stock has a low price-earnings ratio of 7 and a high dividend yield of 2.30%, which equates to a quarterly payout of 60 cents a share.In addition, in terms of the share price, COF stock has been dragged lower following the failures of several regional U.S. lenders. Also, over the last 12 months, Capital One’s stock has declined 17% and is trading nearly 20% below its 52-week high. The share price has gained more than 10% since it was revealed that Buffett bought 9.92 million shares worth $950 million. Still, at current levels, COF stock looks like a bargain and is likely to rise once sentiment towards financial stocks improves.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and BAC.

Vertex’s CF sales continue to grow, driven by its triple therapy, Trikafta/Kaftrio. New reimbursement agreements in ex-U.S. markets and label expansions to younger age groups are driving Trikafta/Kaftrio sales higher, a trend expected to continue this year.While CF remains the main area of focus, Vertex is also developing treatments for sickle cell disease (SCD), beta thalassemia (TDT), acute and neuropathic pain, APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD), type I diabetes, and alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency. It has earlier-stage programs in diseases such as muscular dystrophies.This year is expected to be a catalyst-rich year for Vertex. Multiple clinical milestones are expected in 2023 and 2024, both in its CF and non-CF portfolio.In the year so far, the stock has risen 19.5% against the industry’s 6.2% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVertex is evaluating its medicines in younger patient populations and aims to have small-molecule treatments for most people with CF. Additionally, Vertex is also developing a mRNA therapeutic, VX-522, in partnership with Moderna MRNA for approximately 5,000 people with CF who cannot benefit from its CFTR modulators. Vertex and Moderna are conducting a single ascending dose (SAD) clinical study on VX-522, after the FDA cleared the investigational new drug application in December 2022. Vertex and Moderna expect to complete the SAD and initiate the multiple ascending dose study this year.Vertex is also conducting two pivotal phase III studies, evaluating a triple combination of vanzacaftor/VX-561, a CFTR potentiator, deutivacaftor/VX-121, a CFTR corrector, and tezacaftor in CF patients 12 years and older. This new once-a-day combination medicine has the potential for enhanced patient benefit than Trikafta patients and can potentially treat CF patients who have discontinued Trikafta or other Vertex CF medicines. The studies are expected to be completed by the end of 2023. Vertex also initiated the pivotal development of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor in patients 6 to 11 years oldStory continuesWith AbbVie ABBV discontinuing its CF program recently, we believe, Vertex’s position is further strengthened in this market. AbbVie announced on the first-quarter conference call that it is discontinuing its cystic fibrosis program. The company analyzed data from an ongoing proof-of-concept study evaluating a triple combination therapy in CF. The results from the interim analysis did not meet AbbVie’s internal criteria for advancing the CF program, which prompted AbbVie to end the CF program.While Vertex’s main focus is on the development and strengthening of its CF franchise, the company also has a rapidly advancing mid-to-late stage pipeline in eight disease areas beyond CF like acute pain, SCD, TDT, AMKD, AAT deficiency and cell therapy for type I diabetes. Many of these candidates represent multibillion-dollar opportunities. Six of the programs are past the proof-of-concept stage.Vertex has co-developed a gene-editing treatment, exa-cel (formerly CTX001), in partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics CRSP, for two devastating diseases — SCD and TDT. Vertex is gearing up for the next commercial launch opportunity for exa-cel in SCD and TDT, with exa-cel’s BLA filing with the FDA now complete for both indications. Vertex expects the FDA to grant a priority review to the BLA. Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics’ submissions on exa-cel in Europe and the United Kingdom are also under review.Among its other CF programs, investors are paying a lot of attention to pain asset VX-548, which, they believe, has blockbuster potential. VX-548, a novel first-in-class, non-opioid NaV1.8 inhibitor, is being evaluated in two pivotal phase III acute pain studies, one following bunionectomy surgery and the other following abdominoplasty surgery. The pivotal program is expected to be completed in late 2023 or early 2024. Vertex initiated a phase II study of VX-548 in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a form of peripheral neuropathic pain, in the fourth quarter of 2022. The neuropathic pain study is also expected to be completed in late 2023 or early 2024.Vertex currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.In the last half decade Mohawk Industries saw its share price fall as its EPS declined below zero. This was, in part, due to extraordinary items impacting earnings. At present it's hard to make valid comparisons between EPS and the share price.

But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..A Different PerspectiveMohawk Industries shareholders are down 27% for the year, but the market itself is up 3.9%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 9% per year over five years.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 63% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.After a year of 17% losses, last week’s 6.5% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Cincinnati Financial, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Cincinnati Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cincinnati Financial?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Cincinnati Financial already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cincinnati Financial's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Our data indicates that hedge funds own 5.6% of Cincinnati Financial. That worth noting, since hedge funds are often quite active investors, who may try to influence management. Many want to see value creation (and a higher share price) in the short term or medium term. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.6% and 6.0% of the stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 23 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Cincinnati FinancialThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.We can see that insiders own shares in Cincinnati Financial Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$280m. we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 30% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Cincinnati Financial. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

But over three years, the returns would have left most investors smiling After all, the share price is up a market-beating 53% in that time.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Valero Energy achieved compound earnings per share growth of 232% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 15% average annual increase in the share price. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 2.90.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Valero Energy has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on Valero Energy's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Valero Energy, it has a TSR of 77% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 3.1% in the last year, Valero Energy shareholders lost 22% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 3% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Further, accretive buyouts, an encouraging development pipeline and a solid balance sheet augur well. However, higher e-commerce adoption and high interest rate raise concerns.This retail real estate investment trust (REIT) is focused on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers, which are usually necessity driven and attract dependable traffic. As of the first quarter of 2023, the company’s portfolio comprised 80% grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers.Moreover, its portfolio has a good tenant mix with several industry-leading grocers. This enables it to generate steady rental revenues. Additionally, with people moving into the suburbs due to post-pandemic migration and the hybrid work setup, Regency’s suburban-shopping-center portfolio is expected to garner long-term benefits.The company has been witnessing continued outperformance in tenant sales, resulting in higher percentage rents, especially in the restaurant and grocery categories. We expect 2023 lease income to grow 2.1% year over year.Additionally, it is making efforts to improve its portfolio with acquisitions and developments in key markets. As of Mar 31, 2023, Regency’s in-process development and redevelopment projects estimated net project cost was around $303 million at the company’s share.Regency is focused on strengthening its balance sheet. This retail REIT had full capacity under its $1.2 billion revolving credit facility as of Mar 31, 2023. Additionally, it has no unsecured debt maturities until June 2024. This low leverage with limited near-term maturities offers flexibility to the company.However, the market witnessing a shift in retail shopping from brick-and-mortar stores to Internet sales poses a concern. This is likely to adversely impact the market share for brick-and-mortar stores. Also, the likelihood of tenant bankruptcies and store closures in the near term could affect the company’s profitability.Additionally, a high interest rate environment is a concern for Regency Centers. Elevated rates are likely to affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate. The company also has a substantial debt burden and its net debt as of Mar 31, 2023, was approximately $4.2 billion. We expect interest expenses to rise 1.6% year over year in 2023.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 10.5% over the past six months compared with the industry’s fall of 2.7%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Acadia Realty Trust AKR and Saul Centers BFS, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

Meanwhile, sales beat the consensus mark. Both the metrics improved year over year, backed by the premiumization of its portfolio and aggressive brand investments.In the fiscal fourth quarter, earnings per share (EPS) of 43 cents advanced 36% year over year and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents.Net sales of $1,046 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,003 million. The top line increased 5% year over year on a reported basis. On an organic basis, net sales were up 4% from the prior-year level.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, Brown-Forman’s gross profit amounted to $635 million, up 2% year over year. On an organic basis, the gross profit rose 2%.

On an organic basis, advertising expenses advanced 3%.The operating income advanced 21% year over year to $298 million on a reported basis. The organic operating income rose 3%. The operating margin of 28.5% expanded significantly from the 24.7% reported in the year-ago quarter. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The company’s shares have lost 1.6% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 0.5%.Category-Wise &amp; Channel-Wise PerformanceIn fiscal 2023, net sales increased 8% year over year to $4.2 billion and 10% on an organic basis. The rise was mainly driven by broad-based growth across all geographic regions and the Travel Retail channel on strong consumer demand and favorable price/mix, somewhat offset by currency headwinds.Net sales for Jack Daniel’s family of brands were up 4% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic basis in fiscal 2023. The brand’s sales were driven by solid demand, higher pricing and the estimated increase in distributor inventories. The upside in sales was also driven by the strength in Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey in the international markets and theTravel Retail channel.Premium bourbon brands reported sales growth of 23% and organic sales growth of 24% in fiscal 2023, driven by double-digit growth in Woodford Reserve and Old Forester. An estimated rise in distributor inventories, along with higher volumes and pricing, boosted sales for Woodford Reserve and Old Forester.Jack Daniel’s RTDs/Ready-to-Pours benefited from the introduction of the Jack Daniel’s and Coca-Cola RTD, as well as the launch of Jack Daniel’s Bonded Tennessee Whiskey, resulting in year-over-year sales growth of 11% and 16% on an organic basis. New Mix reported sales growth of 53% and organic sales growth of 45%, driven by market share gains in Mexico, as well as higher volumes and prices.Brown-Forman’s tequila portfolio reported year-over-year sales growth of 10% and on an organic basis. This was driven by double-digit sales growth for the el Jimador and Herradura brands. Sales increased 11% on a reported and 10% on an organic basis for the Herradura brand, driven by higher prices and volumes in Mexico, and volume growth in the United States partly due to an estimated increase in distributor inventories. el Jimador reported year-over-year sales growth of 13% on a reported basis and 14% on an organic basis, driven by growth across all geographic regions, particularly in the Emerging markets and the United States.The company’s overall sales in the United States advanced 3% on a reported and organic basis. The rise was driven by volume gains for Woodford Reserve, owing to the rise in distributor inventories, and higher pricing across the Jack Daniel’s portfolio, as well as the launch of the Jack Daniel’s and Coca-Cola RTD. These were partly negated by lower volumes of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Korbel California Champagne.Meanwhile, the developed international market reported sales growth of 4%, with organic sales rising 10%. The improvement can be attributed to volume gains for the Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Jack Daniel’s RTDs. Additionally, higher pricing for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey has aided the results.The emerging markets registered 18% net sales growth, whereas organic sales improved 24%. This was backed by growth of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey in the United Arab Emirates and Brazil, as well as continued double-digit growth of New Mix in Mexico.Net sales in the Travel Retail channel advanced 41% on a reported basis and 43% on an organic basis due to higher volumes for the majority of the portfolio as travel trends continued to rebound.Story continuesBalance Sheet &amp; Cash FlowThe Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company ended fiscal 2023, with cash and cash equivalents of $374 million, and long-term debt of $2,678 million. Its total shareholders’ equity was $3,268 million.

It has paid regular quarterly dividends for 79 consecutive years and raised the dividend for 39 consecutive years.Brown-Forman Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Brown-Forman Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Brown-Forman Corporation QuoteOutlookManagement has issued the fiscal 2024 view. It anticipates organic sales growth of 5-7% for fiscal 2024. The company remains optimistic about organic sales and organic operating income growth. BF.B predicts trends to normalize after two consecutive years of double-digit organic sales growth.Based on the aforementioned assumptions, Brown-Forman expects the organic operating income to increase 6-8%, driven by lower supply-chain disruption costs, partly offset by continued input cost pressures. The effective tax rate is expected to be 21-23% for fiscal 2024. Capital expenditure is anticipated to be $250-$270 million.Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some other top-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Procter &amp; Gamble PG, Conagra Brands CAG and Celsius Holdings CELH.Conagra Brands, operating as a consumer-packaged goods food company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Procter &amp; Gamble's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Procter &amp; Gamble is:32% = US$14b ÷ US$45b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.32.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Procter &amp; Gamble's Earnings Growth And 32% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Procter &amp; Gamble has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 11% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This probably laid the groundwork for Procter &amp; Gamble's moderate 14% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Procter &amp; Gamble's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 4.1% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is PG worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether PG is currently mispriced by the market.Is Procter &amp; Gamble Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?The high three-year median payout ratio of 59% (or a retention ratio of 41%) for Procter &amp; Gamble suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Additionally, Procter &amp; Gamble has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 59% of its profits over the next three years. As a result, Procter &amp; Gamble's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 38% for future ROE.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Procter &amp; Gamble's performance has been quite good. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

SRCL has undertaken a multi-year business transformation initiative aimed at improving long-term operational and financial outcomes. The company has been benefiting from its acquisition policy and is expected to reap continued favorable outcomes from the same. However, the highly competitive market is a challenge for SRCL.Stericycle, Inc. reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2023 results. Quarterly earnings per share came in at 49 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increasing 53.1% year over year. Revenues of $684.3 million surpassed the consensus mark by 1.9% and increased 3% year over year. Organic revenues increased 7.2% year over year.Current Situation of StericycleThe multi-year business transformation initiative is boding well for Stericycle. The initiative focuses on improving the quality of revenues, driving operational efficiency through work measurement, asset optimization, technology, strategic sourcing; portfolio rationalization through divestitures; debt reduction; leverage improvement and ERP implementation. By improving in these aspects, Stericycle aims to enhance its operational and financial performance.The company has been performing well on the acquisition front. In 2021, Stericycle acquired a Midwest-based regulated waste business for $43.4 million, which strengthened its independent customer base in North America. The company increases its customer base by virtue of acquisitions and thus provides a long-term growth platform for selling multiple services.Stericycle, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Stericycle, Inc.

An increase in the current ratio signifies that the company may not face problems in meeting its short-term debt obligations.Some Concerning PointsStericycle operates in a market with heavy competition and limited barriers to entry. Due to intense competition and pressure from customers Stericycle has reduced prices to retain its existing customers and attract new ones.Story continuesThe company’s global presence makes it vulnerable to foreign currency exchange rate, which takes a toll on the bottom line.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: KB Home KBH, Beazer Homes USA, Inc. BZH, D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI and Meritage Homes Corp. MTH.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Solid Stocks to Buy on a Jump in Construction SpendingSpending on construction projects has been on a steady rise over the past couple of months. This comes despite rising prices, with inflation still at multi-year highs. However, inflation has started showing signs of easing, and expectations are high among investors that the Fed might finally pause hiking interest rates in its June meeting.The latest data from the Commerce Department shows that construction spending increased in April for the second straight month. The jump was primarily driven by spending on private projects. This comes as homebuilding data showed that home prices have been steadily falling, leading to a rise in sales of new homes. Against this backdrop, stocks like KB Home, Beazer Homes USA, Inc., D.R. Horton, Inc. and Meritage Homes Corp. are likely to benefit.Construction Spending ReboundsThe Commerce Department said on Jun 1 that spending on construction projects in the United States jumped a solid 1.2% in April, which came in above the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.2%. Construction spending rose 0.3% in March.On a year-over-year basis, construction spending rose 7.2% in April. Spending on private construction projects jumped 1.3%. Spending on private nonresidential projects like gas and oil well drilling grew 2.4%.The homebuilding industry, which has suffered the most owing to the Fed's steep rate hikes in its bid to tame soaring inflation, has also been showing a steady rebound as spending on residential construction increased 0.5%. Also, spending on outlays on multi-family housing projects rose 0.6% in May.Story continuesAlso, spending on public construction projects climbed 1.1% in May.The homebuilding industry helped the construction sector during the peak of the pandemic when home sales hit record highs. However, sales slowed as the Fed stepped in with its aggressive interest rate hike policy to curb multi-year high inflation.Higher interest rates directly impacted home sales as mortgage rates soared, compelling buyers to put a halt to their plans of purchasing new homes.However, inflation has lately shown signs of easing and spending on residential projects has been picking up.The Commerce Department said last month that new home sales jumped to a 13-month high in April. New home sales rose 4.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 683,000 units, the highest level since 2022.New home sales serve as a leading indicator of the housing market because they are recorded at the time of contract signing.  Economists had predicted new home sales to fall to a rate of 665,000. Year over year, new home sales increased 11.8% in April.This came as separate data showed that permits for future single-family homes also rose in April, while confidence among homebuilders, which had hit rock bottom, rebounded to a 10-month high in May.Our ChoicesGiven this scenario, it will be prudent to invest in homebuilding stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that are poised to gain from the rise in spending on construction projects.

Horton a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invested-1000-d-r-horton-123004327.html,1686141004,STORY,['DHI'],"[How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in D.R. Horton (DHI) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to DHI for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?D.R. Horton's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at D.R. Horton's main business drivers.D.R. Horton, Inc., based in Texas, is one of the leading national homebuilders, primarily engaged in the construction and sale of single-family houses both in the entry-level and move-up markets. D.R. Horton’s operations are spread across 110 markets in 33 states in the East, Midwest, Southeast, South Central, Southwest and West regions of the United States. Its houses are sold under the brand names D.R. Horton - America’s Builder, Emerald Homes, Express Homes and Freedom Homes.D.R. Horton’s reporting segments are as follows: Homebuilding (contributing 95.3% to total revenues in fiscal 2022), Forestar (4.5%), Financial Services (2.4%) and Rental (1.5%). Of the total revenues, 3.7% represents the elimination of intercompany transactions &amp; Other. The Homebuilding segment comprises six reporting regions and derives revenues primarily from the sale of completed homes built on lots it develops and on finished lots purchased ready for home construction. In addition to single-family detached homes (accounting for around 90% of home sale revenues), the segment builds attached homes, such as town homes, duplexes, triplexes and condominiums. The segment also derives revenues by selling lands and lots.As of Mar 31, 2023, the Forestar land development reporting segment operated in 52 markets and 20 states, where it owns — directly or through joint ventures — interests in residential and mixed-use projects. Forestar Group Inc. (FOR), a publicly-traded residential and real estate development company, is a majority-owned subsidiary of D.R. Horton. On Mar 31, 2023, D.R. Horton owned 63% of Forestar’s outstanding common stock.The Financial Services segment, through the mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, provides mortgage financing and title agency services primarily to the company’s homebuilding customers.The Rental segment includes its single-family and multi-family rental operations. Meanwhile, the company remains engaged in other business activities through subsidiaries, through which it conducts insurance-related operations and owns non-residential real estate. These operations are grouped together and presented as other.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in D.R. Horton ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $4,953.59, or a gain of 395.36%, as of June 7, 2023, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 164.02% and gold's return of 36.81% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for DHI.Shares of D.R. Horton have outperformed its industry in the past year. The company has been benefiting from production capabilities, industry-leading market share, solid acquisition strategy, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands and price points. The company’s strategic shift toward more entry-level affordable homes has been paying off, with the segment experiencing strong demand and limited supply. The company also believes that the housing demand will remain favorable, courtesy of a limited supply of new and existing homes at affordable price points despite challenging market conditions, comprising higher rates and uncertain economic conditions. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 have increased in the past 60 days, depicting analysts’ optimism over the stock’s growth potential.The stock has jumped 5.76% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 16 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

322,641eaf1e-6068-3d80-8874-fbb0b7780b1b,AAL,2023-06-08,20 Most Dangerous Countries for LGBTQ+ American Travelers,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-most-dangerous-countries-lgbtq-154759423.html,1686152879,STORY,"['AAL', 'TGT', 'ABNB']","[In this article, we will take a loot at the 20 most dangeorus countries for LGBTQ+ American travelers. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you may jump to 5 Most Dangerous Countries for LGBTQ+ American Travelers.Anti-LGBTQ+ sentiments are getting louder and wilder. Specifically, businesses that are supporting the LGBTQ+ community are under fire from conservative segments of the society. LGBT Capital notes that the purchasing power of the community is $3.9 trillion globally. While professing support for these communities allows them to get a hold of a significant slice of the pie, it's also drawing significant backlash toward them.Rainbow CapitalismJune is Pride Month for the LGBTQ+ community. Every year, millions of spectators gather for the New York Pride March, celebrating LGBTQ+ legal rights, social and self-acceptance, and also their pride. Also known as ""pink capitalism"" or ""pinkwashing,"" rainbow capitalism is when consumerism and capitalism get involved in the LGBT movement.Corporations have been criticized for expressing their support for the pride movement without actually having equity or inclusion policies in place. Many businesses are joining in the event with their marketing campaigns, queer influencer partnerships, and pride-logo products to demonstrate their support for Pride Month. LGBTQ+ individuals travel from all over the world to attend such pride events sponsored by LGBT-friendly companies.One prime example of a company that has been criticized for alleged ""rainbow washing"" is the retail giant Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT). While the company has been showcasing its support for pride month for many years, this year, it has received significant backlash from the LGBTQ community and its supporters for taking a stand without ""conviction"".Being a platinum sponsor of NYC Pride, Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) recently withdrew its Pride merchandise after receiving backlash and potential threats towards the safety of its workers. Evidently, Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) has shown that mass boycotts, lost revenue, and brand-harm can intimidate corporations from coming forward on their stance in regards to the LGBT community.Story continuesDangerous Countries for LGBTQ+ American Travelers2023 has witnessed more than 417 anti-LGBT bills being introduced in state legislatures across the United States. However, its still compartively a far safer country for the LGBT+ community. We have also covered the most gay-friendly cities in the US, which you can take a look at. These include Seattle, Albany and Austin, among others, which can also be regarded as the best places to live for the LGBT+ community.We have covered the safest countries for lgbt+ community to live, as well, in our list of the most LGBT-friendly countries in the world. However, the LGBTQ+ American travelers should stay cautious, especially when traveling to other countries.Many of the developing economies, such as Nigeria, criminalize LGBT+ rights, with even death penalties in countries that are far more conservative. Another dangerous country for LGBTQ+ American travelers is Qatar. Acts of homosexuality in the country are awarded the death penalty. Some other countries that are regarded as dangerous for LGBTQ+ communities include Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Iran.According to the U.S. State Department travel advisory, lesbian, gay, transgender, bisexual, queer, and other intersex travelers may face unique challenges when traveling to other countries. Approximately 70 countries consider consensual same-sex relations a crime, which is why it’s important to go through documents such as Traveler's Checklist and Country Information pages specific to LGBT+ American travelers.Many international travel and vacation companies, such as Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), are pro-LGBTQ+ companies, providing them with great travel experiences and accommodations. With regard to Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), not only is the company a great place to work with for this community, but it is also a top choice for travelers looking for gay-friendly or Pro-LGBTQ+ rentals.Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) listings have a no-discrimination policy its users have to follow. A recent case had a user, who was suspended due to a violation of the said policy, after refusing to rent to a gay couple. Similarly, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) has been the first major airline to protect LGBT team members from discrimination. Being the most gay-friendly airline, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) has been flying with pride along with other airlines such as Alaska Airlines and Atlas Air.Many businesses have also been emerging that are specifically catering to the LGBTQ+ community. With regards to travel, top LGBT travel companies include HE Travel, RSVP Vacation, Out Adventures, and VentureOut, to name a few.20 Most Dangerous Countries for LGBTQ+ American TravelersMybona/Shutterstock.comMethodologyIn order to compile the list of most dangerous countries for LGBTQ+ travelers, we have used Gay Travel Index 2023 from Spartacus, LGBTQ+ Travel Index from Asher &amp; Lyric, and Global Peace Index. The weighted average formula was used to assign weights to the above indexes and calculate an Insider Monkey score.Gay Travel Index and Asher &amp; Lyric Travel Index were assigned equal weights of 40% each, while Global Peace Index was assigned 20% weightage. The weighted averages determined an Insider Monkey average score for each country on which the rankings are based. The countries are ranked in descending order from the highest to the lowest score.Here are the most dangerous countries for LGBT+ American travelers:20. MalaysiaInsider Monkey Score: 157While Malaysia is a beautiful developing country in the Southeast, gay travelers may not be able to enjoy its gorgeous beaches and World Heritage Sites. The country severely punishes homosexuality, and state-backed discrimination is a major reason why LGBT+ American travelers may face challenges, prejudices, and threats on their visit to the country. Moreover, the population is generally conservative. As such, the country's tourism minister has also denied the existence of this community, and if found, homosexuality is punishable with up to 20 years in prison, fines, and whipping.19. TunisiaInsider Monkey Score: 160While Tunisia wholeheartedly accepts tourists, the LGBT community is not received with open arms. Homosexuality is a crime in the country that is punishable by up to 3 years imprisonment. As such, American LGBT+ travelers are advised to exercise discretion when traveling. Article 230 of the Penal Code condemns indecent exposure and indecent assault.18. TanzaniaInsider Monkey Score: 162Tanzania is an international hub for tourists and is known for its natural parks, gorgeous beaches, and wilderness areas. Like many other countries, Tanzania has proclaimed homosexuality as illegal, and anyone found can face a maximum penalty of 30 years or even life imprisonment. These laws are unlikely to be changed anytime soon. Even the residents of Tanzania consider it unlawful and an unnatural way of life. The general attitude is the same for others from the LGBT+ community like bisexual and trans individuals.17. RussiaInsider Monkey Score: 162In June 2013, Russia passed a new law concerning the ""propaganda"" of non-traditional sexual relations for minors. Last year, the so-called propaganda was extended by the lower house of parliament. Even the promotion of homosexuality online, in books, or in films is banned. Anya's activities or conduct will be subjected to major fines and penalties. Foreigners can also be expelled if they are found of non-compliance. The situation is worse in Russian republics like Chechnya.16. KuwaitInsider Monkey Score: 164Tourism is increasing in Kuwait, but the attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors that LGBTs may face are different compared to non-LGBT tourists. As such, tourists should refrain from attending parties or events that are controversial in the eyes of the law. Public ""immorality"" is prohibited; however, impersonating the same sex has now been outlawed.15. BruneiInsider Monkey Score: 165Another dangerous country for LGBT+ American travelers is Brunei. Spartacus Travel Index ranks the country at 159, while A&amp;F ranks it at number 203. Homosexuality is a crime in Brunei, with its punishment being death by stoning. This is applicable to all residents and tourists coming into the country, which is why it's best to exercise discretion when traveling here.14. UgandaInsider Monkey Score: 165Uganda is one of the most populous countries in Africa and apparently one of the most dangerous countries to travel to for the LGBTQ+ community. The Anti-Homosexuality Act of 2023 has pushed the country further into the spotlight. Those found engaging in same-sex relations will be imprisoned for a lifetime or charged with the death penalty. Travelers must exercise discretion when visiting the country or risk the charges stated above.13. United Arab EmiratesInsider Monkey Score: 167UAE is increasingly becoming a dangerous place for the LGBTQ+ community. Millions of visitors come to see Dubai and Abu Dhabi, but it can be the among the worst places for LGBT American travelers. UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Iran are all setting up coordinated efforts to crack down on their existence in the Emirates, and both the locals and foreigners are to bear the brunt. Homosexuality is strictly forbidden and punishable by law.12. MalawiInsider Monkey Score: 168Malawi strictly forbids homosexuality, which is why it is not safe for LGBT+ travelers to visit the country. Punishments for such acts are very strict, with same-sex acts resulting in 14 years in prison for men and up to 5 years imprisonment for women. Men cannot even keep long hair, and any man found having hair longer than their mouth can receive imprisonment for up to six months. The public sentiments regarding homosexuality aren't encouraging either, which is why the country is not a good place to travel to for this community.11. South SudanInsider Monkey Score: 169While South Sudan gained independence from Sudan back in 2011, the country still uses extreme interpretations of the Sharia law. This law implies that all acts of homosexuality are forbidden in the country, and punishments could range anywhere between lashes and even death. Even the majority of the population in the country is against such acts and individuals, which is why it is one of the worst countries to travel to for the LGBTQ+ community.10. EthiopiaInsider Monkey Score: 171While Ethiopia is already a worst travel destination due to its civil unrest, crime, conflicts, and terrorism, it is even worst for LGBT+ American travelers. LGBTQ+ community has no rights in the country, and the general population is against homosexuality as well. Same-sex relations are outlawed, and those found guilty can face imprisonment of up to 15 years. Some religious groups are very extreme and urge authorities to ban trips that are organized by tour operators catering to this population.9. SudanInsider Monkey Score: 173Similar to Sudan, homosexuality is a crime that is punishable under the country's law. The general population is also against the idea of homosexuality, and overall it is not a safe country to travel to. Spartacus ranks the country at 159, while Asher &amp; Lyric places it at number 195 to depict how far this country is behind on safety for LGBTQ travelers. The Sudanese Penal Code criminalizes acts of sodomy, ""indecent acts"", ""indecent acts in public spaces"", ""seduction"", and materials that are contrary to ""morals"". Hence, it is one of the most dangerous countries for gay travelers.8. EgyptInsider Monkey Score: 174Egypt has always been a traveler's favorite, thanks to its huge pyramids and historical and religious significance. However, the country holds negative laws pertaining to homosexuality, which is why it has made it to our list. Since 2013, more than 250 LGBT individuals have been arrested in the country, and there is a consistent crackdown on such individuals. Same-sex acts can lead to up to 3 years’ imprisonment, while possession of homosexual materials will lead to two years’ prison along with a fine. LGBTQ+ travelers are strictly advised not to disclose their sexual identity to anyone or use any dating applications in the country.7. IranInsider Monkey Score: 181LGBTQ+ travelers must avoid traveling to Iran due to extreme punishments for acts of homosexuality, transgenderism and bisexuality. Same-sex acts in the country will be subjected to 31 lashes, while intercourse will lead to 100 lashes or the death penalty. More than 5,000 gays and lesbians have been executed in the country for such offenses since 1979.6. LibyaInsider Monkey Score: 184Libya is an overall dangerous country to travel to regardless of the sexual orientation of individuals. Terrorism, violence, and civil unrest have made the country very unsafe. Moreover, the laws prohibit any or all activities that fall outside of heterosexual marriage. Anyone found going against these laws is subjected to amputation and flogging.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Dangerous Countries for LGBTQ+ American Travelers.  Suggested Articles:25 Most LGBTQ-Friendly Countries in the World15 Most Powerful Currencies in the World20 American Cities With the Highest Uninsured RatesDisclosure: none. 20 Most Dangerous Countries for LGBTQ+ American Travelers is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

According to its public profile, Principal helps people and companies across the world build, protect, and advance their financial well-being through various services. Of course, it’s a bit of an ironic statement given that, by the books, PFG is one of the top stocks to sell now.I’m not making such an assessment flippantly. For one thing, PFG slipped nearly 22% since the beginning of this year. Worse yet, in the trialing month, the downside accelerated sharply, with PFG losing almost 12%. However, it’s really the Wall Street analysts that consider PFG to be one of the high-risk stocks to sell.Story continuesAccording to TipRanks, Principal Financial shares carry a consensus view of moderate sell. To be fair, the experts have an average price target of $75.55, implying over 15% upside potential. Nevertheless, within the past seven months, not a single analyst assigned PFG as a buy.Financially, many investors are likely taking a dim view of Principal’s quarterly revenue trend, which has been sharply declining sequentially since the second quarter of 2022. Therefore, PFG is one of the stocks to avoid according to strategists.Clorox (CLX)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockBased on the fundamentals, household goods giant Clorox (NYSE:CLX) doesn’t seem a natural candidate for top stocks to sell now. As the manufacturer of trusted bleach and cleaning products, Clorox hardly rates as a sexy investment. At the same time, you can’t go through life without needing the underlying product categories. Since everyone knows the Clorox brand name, it should make for a safe buy.Indeed, the charts seemingly confirm bullish sentiment, with shares up over 11% since the January opener. Despite the relevance, CLX is actually one of the strategists’ recommended stocks to sell. Per TipRanks, Wall Street analysts peg CLX as a moderate sell. Even worse, the average price target lands at $150.93, implying almost 5% downside risk.Out of 16 experts within the past three months, only one analyst – Raymond James’ Olivia Tong – views CLX as a buy. The others view shares as either a hold (five ratings) or sell (10 ratings). Contributing to pensiveness for CLX is the valuation. Currently, CLX trades at nearly 273-times trailing earnings and over 29-times forward earnings. Both stats rank worse than at least 80% of the competition. Sadly, then, CLX qualifies as one of the best stocks to sell due to market jitters.Franklin Resources (BEN)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in San Mateo, California, Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN) makes a case for top stocks to sell now because of fading pertinence. A global investment management firm serving clients in over 165 countries according to its public profile, Franklin, unfortunately, suffers from rising economic concerns. From stubborn inflation to spiking interest rates to debt ceiling drama (among other headwinds), the investment sector courts serious challenges.In turn, investors don’t have much confidence in BEN. Since the beginning of this year, shares stumbled more than 11%. Sadly, such magnitude of red ink means that Franklin shares rank among the stocks to avoid according to strategists. Presently, the Street pegs CLX as a consensus moderate sell. Even more ominous, the average price target sits at $22.79, implying slightly over 5% downside risk.Tellingly, out of seven experts covering BEN in the past 90 days, not a single one rated shares a buy. Instead, we have three holds and four sells. And the latest price target is the worst at $20, implying nearly 17% downside risk. In particular, Franklin incurs declining gross and operating margins. Also, its Altman Z-Score is 1.64, implying distress.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Check out a video of the announcement here.The Gatorade Player of the Year award recognizes athletes not just for their excellence on the playing surface, but for their commitment in the classroom and impact in their community. Clark beat out nearly half a million other student-athletes who play baseball nationwide, topping the list of state winners in baseball who collectively boast an incredible list of accomplishments, including 39 with signed National Letters of Intent to play baseball at Division I colleges/universities and 35 with a GPA of 3.5 and above.""Max Clark is another standout in the fine tradition of past Gatorade National Baseball Player of the Year honorees,"" said Jim Callis, senior writer for MLB Pipeline. ""He might well be the best all-around player in this year's draft as a center fielder with four tools that grade as at least 'plus' to go with developing power. He's starred both in the Indiana high school ranks and also on the international stage with Team USA.""The 6-foot-1, 205-pound senior center fielder batted .646 with six home runs, 33 RBI and 45 runs scored this past season, leading the Grizzly Cubs (14-14-1) to the Class 4A sectional semifinals.

He has signed a National Letter of Intent to play baseball on scholarship at Vanderbilt University this fall, but is projected as a first-round selection in July's Major League Baseball draft.In addition to excellence on and off the field of play, Gatorade Players of the Year also pay it forward for the next generation. As part of Gatorade's Play it Forward initiative, Clark will receive a grant to give to a 501c3 youth sports charity, which includes Gatorade's social impact partners – Athlete Ally, Laureus USA, Move United, Women's Sports Foundation and Up2Us Sports – supporting Gatorade's ambition to fuel the future of sport.  ""Winning Gatorade Player of the Year is truly an incredible feat because you have to distinguish yourself from so many tough competitors,"" said Gatorade Portfolio president and general manager Michael Del Pozzo. ""Nearly half a million student-athletes play high school baseball nationwide, and Max stood above them all.""Each year, a selection committee evaluates the nation's top talent to choose one state winner from each of the 50 states as well as Washington D.C., in 12 different sports: football, girls volleyball, boys and girls cross country, boys and girls basketball, baseball, softball, boys and girls soccer, and boys and girls track &amp; field.

The organization offers competitive club soccer, rec leagues, and college identification camps –– all completely free, and recently launched a funding campaign to launch a second female team.Houston reVision (Houston) – The mission of ReVision is to leverage the power of community by connecting youth with mentors, positive peers and life-changing resources.

We have a clear strategy to maintain a culture of compliance and integrity at Quest that engages all our employees and emphasizes the importance of ethical behavior through our policies, training, assessments, and reporting practices.PoliciesQuest's Code of Ethics is critical to our success, empowering us with the roadmap we need to earn and maintain the trust of our patients, customers, shareholders, and colleagues. Our Code is not merely a set of rules-it defines our approach to making good decisions no matter what our role is and creates a shared sense of pride among all of us.Our Code and compliance policies apply to all employees, subsidiaries, vendors, contractors, suppliers, interns, business partners, and representatives who work on our behalf. We expect the best from ourselves and one another, including a commitment to Quest's core values of leadership, integrity, quality, innovation, collaboration, and accountability.We expect one another to ask questions and take action if something isn't right. Employees who have concerns are encouraged to share them with their manager; a representative from our Human Resources, Compliance, or Legal departments; or confidentially or anonymously through our hotline or online inquiry form.TrainingWe look to our managers and supervisors to always promote our Code and model the right behaviors. This includes creating an open-door environment, making it clear that any form of retaliation is unacceptable when an employee raises concerns, ensuring employees are properly trained, and being fully present to offer guidance and support. All full-time, part-time, and contract employees are required to complete training upon hire as well as on an ongoing, annual basis. The training topics include compliance, fraud, and abuse; privacy; corruption; bribery; and our Code of Ethics. Select employees are also trained on compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Protection Act (FCPA). Our compliance training program is reviewed as part of our internal audit process, with select segments overseen by our Legal department.Story continuesRisk assessmentThe best way to assess compliance risks-and the capacity to effectively address those risks-is to do so consistently and continuously throughout the year. We expect all employees to identify any compliance issues within their areas of responsibility.The company engages in an annual risk assessment specific to compliance, assessing and categorizing compliance risks regarding severity and the level of mitigation required. The Compliance Risk Assessment is conducted at the direction of counsel and is an element of the enterprise risk management (ERM) program.Reporting processWe routinely communicate with employees on how to confidentially report a violation of the Code and take all reports of violations extremely seriously. Reports are investigated by the Compliance, Human Resources, and/or Legal departments, as appropriate. If the investigation reveals a violation of a compliance policy, the Compliance department oversees any necessary corrective action including discipline up to and including termination. The corrective action taken is dictated by the type of issue involved, based on the circumstances and facts gathered during the investigative process, and consistent with written disciplinary guidelines. Our Senior Vice President of Compliance provides oversight on the program and reports directly to our CEO.Our commitment to human rightsWe are committed to protecting human rights across our operations, including our supply chain.

Cisco will harness large language models (LLMs) across its Collaboration and Security portfolios to help organizations drive productivity and simplicity for their workforce.Expectations are at an all-time high – organizations are grappling with how to deliver unrivaled experiences for hybrid workers, while safeguarding their businesses from sophisticated cyber threats.According to Cisco's 2023 State of Global Innovation Study, IT professionals rank generative AI as the technology most likely to have a significant impact on their business, with 85% of those saying they're prepared for its impact. Cisco recognizes the important role generative AI will play in advancing the future of work and is committed to providing hybrid workers with an efficient, safer, and more productive, work experience.""Generative AI will quickly become pervasive as we see businesses and workers embrace the technology to become materially more productive,"" said Jeetu Patel, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Security and Collaboration, Cisco. ""At Cisco, we've been using AI for years. Now we're unveiling how we're incorporating generative AI into our existing products, helping customers drive real value to unlock the most secure, unrivaled work experiences possible.""New Summarization Capabilities in Webex by Cisco With every work interaction being hybrid, employees, and customers need collaboration experiences that empower them to do their best work. Within the Webex Suite, new summarization capabilities that help people get up to speed in seconds will include:Story continues""Catch Me Up"" will allow users to quickly catch up on missed interactions, including meetings, calling, chats and more.Intelligent meeting summaries with key points and action items. Users can opt in to automatically generate the most important elements of a Webex meeting, extract the key points, and capture action items with owners. This will be a huge time-saver for attendees and people unable to join a meeting – eliminating the need to listen to a recording or read through transcripts.Summaries in Vidcast, the company's video messaging tool. This capability will produce highlights and chapters so viewers can navigate to the most important parts of the video quickly.New conversation summaries in Webex Contact Center will provide agents with a fast, automated way to consume long-form text from digital chats with customers as well as facilitating post-call wrap-up and resolution with customers. For example, if a customer is escalated to a call with a human agent, they expect that agent to be informed and not have to repeat their frustrations. Chat summaries provides the agent with a clear summarization of issues and resolutions already explored via self-service and a summary of the call to both the agent and customer once it ends.Moving Security from Complex to Conversational Cisco is investing in cutting-edge innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning that will augment security staff by simplifying operations and increasing efficacy. Further delivering on its Security Cloud vision (link to Day 1 release), Cisco is previewing new generative AI capabilities to simplify policy management and improve threat response.Effective security policy creation and management is an oftentimes extremely complex but critical function of cybersecurity hygiene. There is little room for error and the process of making simple edits that won't interfere with or override previous rules is extremely time consuming and technically challenging. The volume, inconsistency, and complexity of maintaining all of these policies across all of these systems creates a significant risk that opens the door for attacks.The Cisco Security Cloud will leverage a generative AI Policy Assistant to address this problem by enabling security and IT administrators to describe granular security policies and evaluate how to best implement them across different aspects of their security infrastructure.This week's preview showed how the Cisco Policy Assistant can reason with the existing firewall policy set to implement and simplify rules within the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center. It is the first of many examples of how generative AI can reimagine policy management across the Cisco Security Cloud.Augmenting Analysts with Machine Speed and Scale Threat detection and response is another complex and high stakes responsibility of the security operations where time is of the essence and analysts must rapidly gain understanding of complex systems at machine scale.Cisco's security operations center (SOC) Assistant will augment security analysts with the context to make the right decisions at the right time. The SOC Assistant will provide a comprehensive situation analysis for analysts, correlating intel across the Cisco Security Cloud platform solutions, relaying potential impacts, and providing recommended actions. Significantly reducing the time needed for SOC teams to respond to potential threats.Cisco will preview its generative AI solution for Webex and Security Cloud onstage at Cisco LIVE 2023. Webex summarization, policy management and SOC Assistant Summaries will be available by the end of calendar year 2023. The additional SOC Assistant features will be available in the first half of calendar 2024.Cisco's Approach to Generative AI For years, Cisco has leveraged AI with audio, video, natural language understanding, and analytics to create unrivaled experiences for Webex users – with the security Cisco is known for. New enhancements in LLM and generative AI are advancing this even further to deliver unrivaled hybrid work experiences. Webex has established a first set of principles, consisting of multi-modal support, permissions, privacy, and accuracy for its enterprise-grade AI. This includes only using data that individuals already have permission to access, based on the privacy and security rules of that specific data source.About CiscoCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that securely connects everything to make anything possible.
