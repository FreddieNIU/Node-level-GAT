Many companies offer above-average payouts, while the best ones routinely increase their dividends. ', ""Park Hotels & Resorts (NYSE: PK), Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD), and EPR Properties (NYSE: EPR) are great ways to satisfy your desire for income. Here's why they stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as great high-yield dividend payers to buy for income this year and those to come. "", 'Tyler Crowe (Park Hotels & Resorts): Hotel real estate is a binary market right now. Hotels that are geared toward leisure and vacation travel are doing awesome. Those that are designed to cater to business travelers are doing awful. Park Hotels & Resorts owns some of both. Its properties include some major destination resorts such as the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort and the Waldorf Astoria Orlando. It also owns major business travel hotels such as the New York Hilton Midtown. Even though its hotel portfolio is only about 28% geared toward business travel, the market seems to be focusing almost exclusively on the business travel side of the equation.', ""Back in June, Park Hotels announced it was turning over the keys to two Hilton-operated hotels in downtown San Francisco\xa0 to its lenders. A real estate company letting some of its properties default on their debt and fall into receivership sounds terrifying, but it will likely benefit the business in the long term. Business travel in the downtown San Francisco area has been hit harder than other central business districts, and Park's approximately 3,000 hotel beds in the area were operating at a loss. After walking away from the properties, the company will generate about the same amount of adjusted EBITDA while reducing its net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 6.0 to 5.2."", ""Despite Parks arguably becoming a better business after the San Francisco exit, the company's stock trades for a significant discount to many of its hospitality REIT peers. As of this writing, it has a dividend yield of 8.9% and a price-to-book-value ratio of 0.8. This hotel REIT looks like it is mispriced, and investors may want to take a deeper dive."", 'Matt DiLallo (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF): There are lots of great higher-yielding dividend stocks. That can make it difficult to choose which one to buy at any given time.', ""The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF makes it so you don't have to pick between top dividend stocks. The exchange-traded fund (ETF) owns more than 100 of them. It focuses on companies that pay quality and sustainable dividends, and its shares trade like a stock. It also offers a higher dividend yield than average -- over the trailing-12-month period, its yield was 3.6%, more than double that of an S&P 500 index fund. "", ""The ETF's portfolio of top dividend stocks is diversified. While its top three holdings are all healthcare stocks (AbbVie, Merck, and Amgen), that sector only makes up 16.6% of its total value (second to industrials at 17.7%). The fund also counts dividend stalwarts like Coca-Cola, Verizon, and Chevron among its top 10 holdings. It typically owns companies with above-average yields and payouts that steadily rise each year. (Coca-Cola has increased its payout for more than 60 straight years, while Chevron has delivered more than three decades of dividend growth.) That has enabled the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF to steadily increase its cash distributions to investors. "", 'SCHD Dividend data by YCharts.', 'That upward trajectory in ETF distributions should continue. While there will likely be some variability from payment to payment depending on its holdings and when they pay their dividends, the total annual income generated by the ETF should rise as the underlying companies grow their payouts. That makes it an excellent option for those seeking an attractive and growing income stream in 2024 and beyond.', ""Jason Hall (EPR Properties): The movie theater industry is still struggling in North America, and EPR is heavily exposed to it. A year ago, well above 40% of its rental income came from theaters. The good news is that management is delivering on its promise to reduce its exposure to theaters. It's making good progress on selling off a portion of this portfolio, bringing the exposure of the real estate investment trust (REIT) down to 39% last quarter, even as occupancy and revenues stabilize."", ""Yet the market is still treating EPR like it's on the cusp of trouble. At recent prices, shares are still more than 30% below pre-pandemic levels, while the S&P 500 is up by 48%. Meanwhile, on a total return basis, the REIT is down by about 16%, while the index has delivered a 58% gain over that period."", 'Considering the progress it has made in reducing its theater exposure and the strength of the rest of its portfolio (not to mention the room it has to grow in that $100 billion experiential real estate market), I think EPR looks incredibly attractive. At recent prices, its dividend -- which it distributes monthly -- yields nearly 7%.', ""In fairness, the market is starting to see the potential. EPR shares did deliver a total return of almost 40% in 2023. But the stock is still trading at a bargain valuation compared to its historical levels even after last year's strong run-up, and remains worth buying now and holding for many years to come."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF wasn't one of them.

On the same day, it announced some good news and some bad news.', 'Wall Street tends to think short term, so the bad news attracted a lot more attention. Long-term dividend investors, however, should pay far more attention to the good news.', ""Steel is a highly cyclical industry, prone to swift ups and downs over short periods of time based on shifts in demand and pricing. Over longer periods, capital investment is a huge driver of the company's financial results."", ""That makes recessions particularly difficult for the top and bottom lines. This is just part and parcel of the company's business, and there's no way to avoid this fundamental feature of the steel industry."", ""That's where the bad news comes in. Given the volatile nature of the steel industry, Nucor and its peers make a habit of updating earnings guidance shortly before scheduled earnings releases. This way, the company avoids surprising Wall Street on the day of earnings. Nucor's updated guidance for the fourth quarter of 2023 wasn't good."", 'According to the news release: ""Nucor expects fourth-quarter earnings to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85 per diluted share. Nucor reported net earnings of $4.57 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023 and $4.89 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2022.""', ""That's a sizable year-over-year drop and a material sequential decline. The big hit came from the double whammy of lower prices and volumes. And that's how it goes in the volatile steel industry."", 'The interesting thing about that news release is that it was one of two releases issued on the same day. The second release highlighted that the dividend was increased to $0.54 per share per quarter.', 'It\'s hard to get a read on how material that is from the release, though Nucor did highlight its status as a Dividend King by explaining that, ""Nucor has increased its regular, or base, dividend for 51 consecutive years -- every year since it first began paying dividends in 1973.""', ""That's good, but it doesn't do justice to the dividend increase. The previous quarterly dividend was $0.51 per share, so the new rate amounts to a roughly 6% increase. Over the past decade, the average annual increase at Nucor was roughly 3%, so this is a notable uptick in the growth rate."", ""As the chart above shows, Nucor's dividend increases regularly, but often the figure is modest. But then, every so often, there's an outsized increase. Those hikes are generally associated with something important changing in the business, like a new plant coming on line."", ""The 6% increase suggests that, despite the volatility of the steel industry, Nucor's business isn't only fundamentally strong, but also still growing in important ways. Otherwise, management would have provided just a token hike."", ""Nucor's shares aren't exactly cheap today, with the 1.3% dividend yield toward the low end of its yield range over the past decade. Investors looking to buy Nucor might want to keep it on their wish lists, perhaps jumping aboard during a recession, when things look extra ugly for steel stocks."", ""However, if you own this Dividend King, you'll want to pay more attention to the recent dividend news than the updated earnings guidance.

Not only did it elect to keep interest rates steady, but it also indicated cuts to the all-important federal funds rate. The median estimate calls for three rate cuts by the end of 2024.', ""The federal funds rate is the rate at which banks lend each other money, and it's the biggest determinant of rates for just about every type of loan from a government bond to a home mortgage. The Federal Reserve is in charge of setting that rate, and by extension the cost to borrow for everyone from the government to consumers to businesses."", 'While the Fed forecasts just three interest rate cuts, Wall Street is more optimistic. The average futures trader expects six rate cuts by the end of the year, bringing the top end of the Fed funds target rate from 5.5% to just 4%.', 'Many businesses have been hit hard by high interest rates. But a few could see tremendous relief from lower costs to borrow that could fuel their earnings and, by extension, their stock prices much higher. Here are three stocks to buy today, before the Fed cuts interest rates.', 'Real estate investment trusts (REITs) were hit particularly hard by rising interest rates.', 'A couple of factors punished shares of REITs. First, and most obvious, higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing, which is essential for most REITs. A higher interest expense on the books means lower funds from operation, which means less cash to pass on to shareholders.', 'But the bigger impact of the increased interest rates is that investors now discount the future cash flows of a REIT at a much higher rate.', ""The REITs most affected by changes in interest rates are those with steady cash flow from long-term leases. Realty Income (NYSE: O) is the poster child for steadily growing free cash flow with its portfolio of retail storefronts concentrated in defensive sectors. As a triple-net lease operator, it's not responsible for rising taxes, insurance, or maintenance on its properties (the tenants are), which makes it far less risky than other REITs. But with such predictable free cash flow, it was also easiest to discount amid rising interest rates."", ""While shares of Realty Income already got a boost after the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting in December indicated forthcoming rate cuts, it could still move higher based on Wall Street's expectations for even more rate cuts than indicated by the Fed. Shares still trade for less than 15 times management's expectations for 2023 adjusted funds from operations. That's a better-than-fair price to pay for the REIT."", ""If you've been trying to buy a house recently, you're probably familiar with Zillow Group (NASDAQ: Z) (NASDAQ: ZG). The online real estate listing company is the leading destination for home searchers. You'll also probably know there aren't many houses for sale."", ""Management noted new listing volumes are as low as they've ever been since 2010. There's a clear reason for that. Many homeowners have locked in record-low mortgage rates in 2020 and 2021. Meanwhile, new buyers have seen their buying power diminish as a result of higher mortgage rates, further reducing the number of available buyers."", 'Zillow generates its revenue from rental listings, mortgage origination, and home sale listing tools for agents. While the rental market has helped prop up its results in 2023, the challenging environment for new home sales has led to overall revenue declines for Zillow. But as interest rates decline, more homeowners are willing to move, and more people are able to afford new homes, Zillow should see strong growth.', 'Management expects rate cuts to provide a massive boon to its top line. Its long-term forecast in early 2022 called for $5 billion in annual revenue with a 45% earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin by the end of 2025. That would be phenomenal growth considering its 2023 outlook calls for $1.9 billion. Still, even half that growth, fueled by an expanding portfolio of services and a little help from the Federal Reserve, could make the stock a buy. Analysts currently expect just 9.4% sales growth for 2024, so a resurgence in the housing market could enable strong outperformance for Zillow.', ""NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP) got hit hard by the rise in interest rates. The company relied on convertible equity portfolio financing (CEPF) to buy assets from its parent company, NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), as well as from third-party sellers. Those notes are convertible to shares based on the price of NextEra Energy Partners' shares."", ""When interest rates rose, NextEra Energy Partners' financing costs increased too. That put pressure on its stock price as a result, which became a double whammy for the company, as it now has to provide more shares to convert its maturing CEPFs. It was forced to find new funding, and it did so in the sale of some of its assets. It recently agreed to sell its STX Midstream business to Kinder Morgan for $1.8 billion, and it'll use a portion of the proceeds to pay off its debt."", ""Another challenge of the increased interest rates was that NextEra Energy Partners is now unable to acquire as many assets to fuel its growth. It's instead focusing on organic growth, such as repowering existing wind farms. However, that will result in significantly slower growth than it was experiencing before the shift in strategy. As a result, management cut its dividend growth outlook in half, which sent the share price down further (putting further pressure on management to extinguish the CEPFs)."", ""However, a turnaround in interest rates could alleviate a lot of the pressure on NextEra Energy Partners. With $1.35 billion in debt maturing this year and an additional $700 million coming due next year, lower interest rates will enable it to refinance without as big a hit to its interest expense. With the shares yielding 11.4% on its dividend with management's target to keep growing the dividend at a 6% rate, it's worth buying shares of the high-yield MLP."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.', ' See our latest analysis for Salesforce ', 'You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Salesforce had US$9.43b of debt in October 2023, down from US$10.6b, one year before. But on the other hand it also has US$11.9b in cash, leading to a US$2.44b net cash position.', 'According to the last reported balance sheet, Salesforce had liabilities of US$19.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$13.5b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$11.9b as well as receivables valued at US$4.85b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$16.2b.', ""Of course, Salesforce has a titanic market capitalization of US$263.2b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Salesforce also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely."", ""Even more impressive was the fact that Salesforce grew its EBIT by 984% over twelve months. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Salesforce can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. Salesforce may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, Salesforce actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit."", ""While it is always sensible to look at a company's total liabilities, it is very reassuring that Salesforce has US$2.44b in net cash. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$8.8b, being 290% of its EBIT. So is Salesforce's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Salesforce is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about..."", ""If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Concerns stemming from a challenged economy caused pronounced selling activity, sending stocks into a nosedive. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 33% in 2022 -- marking only the sixth time in over 50 years it's dropped by that level or more."", ""In the midst of 2022's sell-off, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) completed a 20-for-1 stock split. Analyzing stock-split stocks can be an interesting exercise as it may shed some light on companies that have experienced higher trading volumes and witnessed a surging share price. While stock splits do not inherently increase the value of a company, seasoned investors know that following a stock split, the company's shares typically tend to see increased demand -- given its perceived lower price -- that eventually pushes up the stock price."", 'Since splitting in July 2022, Alphabet stock has returned about 28% -- much lower than its big tech counterparts such as Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Nvidia. I think a lot of this has to do with artificial intelligence (AI), and which companies are seen as emerging leaders.', ""One could argue that Microsoft, Nvidia, and even Tesla garner the most attention when it comes to AI. Microsoft kicked off the AI race after a $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the developer behind ChatGPT. Meanwhile, demand for Nvidia's semiconductor chips, which are used to train generative AI models, is surging, and Tesla appears to be on the brink of commercially available autonomous driving."", 'Given this level of competition, AI investors may have missed out on Alphabet\'s progress. In fact, billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman thinks Alphabet\'s AI business is so overlooked that investors can buy it ""for free.""', ""I agree with Ackman's position and think Alphabet stock looks like a bargain. Let's dig into why 2024 could be a great time to buy some shares in this underappreciated AI leader."", 'Since it was founded in 1971, the Nasdaq Composite has only generated negative returns 14 times. The only periods that the index had consecutive years of declining returns were in 1973 and 1974, as well as 2000, 2001, and 2002.', ""These trends underscore the resiliency of the Nasdaq, given it tends to bounce back after a down year. However, while inflation is beginning to cool and many economists believe the Federal Reserve is finished with rate hikes, I wouldn't be surprised if the tumultuous market conditions from 2022 might still be lingering in the back of your mind -- causing some hesitation when it comes to tech stocks in particular."", 'Over the last two decades, the Nasdaq has only dropped by 30% or more on three occasions -- 2002, 2008, and 2022. Interestingly, following the market crashes of 2002 and 2008, the Nasdaq went on to surge for consecutive years thereafter. From 2002 to 2007, the Nasdaq returned an average of 15.9% per year. And from 2009 to 2010, the index increased by an average of 30%.', ""To be clear, the past performance of the Nasdaq doesn't guarantee future results. However, given the booming demand for AI, I think 2024 could be another robust year for tech stocks following the Nasdaq's 43% bounceback return last year."", 'Over the last couple of years, the broader economy has been plagued with high inflation and borrowing costs, forcing companies of all sizes to reign in spending and operate on leaner budgets. These macroeconomic factors took their toll on many different sectors, and the technology landscape was particularly impacted as demand for expensive software applications started to wane.', 'As it relates to Alphabet and its gigantic advertising business, marketers have become increasingly selective in how to allocate campaign dollars. It should come as no surprise that this put Alphabet at the center of an intense battle among competing social media platforms TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram.', ""Nevertheless, Alphabet has invested significant capital into new products and services -- which are already helping the company return to growth. It's been integrating AI capabilities across its entire ecosystem, including areas such as Google Cloud, Google Search, video-sharing website YouTube, and productivity tools within Google Workspace."", ""Additionally, the release of its ChatGPT competitor called Gemini could just be the catalyst the company needs to be considered a leader among AI developers. Yet despite all of these exciting gains, Alphabet stock isn't garnering a premium commensurate with its big-tech counterparts -- making the stock a tempting buy at its current valuation."", 'The chart above illustrates the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples for the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks. At a forward P/E of 20.3, Alphabet stock is effectively tied for last place with Meta. Moreover, this is right in line with the S&P 500\'s forward P/E of 20.7 -- possibly signaling that investors don\'t expect Alphabet to outperform the broader markets.', ""To me, Alphabet stock is absurdly undervalued. Despite cooling inflation and the possibility of Federal Reserve tapering interest rates this year, I suspect that many are wary over the company's growth prospects. More specifically, the company's rebound in advertising in 2023 is encouraging -- but keep in mind that revenue only increased 7% year over year through the first nine months of 2023."", 'I think this is a short-sighted concern, especially with 2024 containing tailwinds that could boost digital advertising platforms. Furthermore, Alphabet is making notable strides in cloud computing -- a market largely dominated by Amazon and Microsoft right now.', ""There's no doubt that Alphabet has a lot to prove. But keep in mind that the stock has returned over 5,300% to investors since its initial public offering in 2004. Even just a $1,000 investment 20 years ago would now be worth roughly $54,000."", ""To me, this underscores Alphabet's strong performance over a long-term time horizon. While the company will likely continue fending off an increasing number of competitors, I think management is taking impressive actions to diversify Alphabet's products and services and building the foundation for long-term sustained growth.

Google remains the global search leader, the world\'s largest online advertiser, and a ""Big Three"" cloud infrastructure provider, which will continue to buoy its fortunes.', ""Perhaps the biggest catalyst will be Alphabet's efforts involving artificial intelligence (AI). Alphabet recently rolled out Gemini, a program it claims is the most advanced generative AI system yet. It also offers more than 100 prebuilt AI models via Google Cloud and custom tools to make users more productive."", 'This gives Alphabet multiple catalysts to boost its stock in 2024. Trading at 4 times forward sales, the stock is historically cheap.', 'Economic headwinds, led by soaring inflation, weighed heavily on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in 2022, but green shoots of growth are appearing across its vast operations. Digital retail is bouncing back, and AI is boosting cloud spending, fueling its two largest growth areas.', 'The company has also planted its stake in AI, providing cloud customers with all the top generative AI models via Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company continues to integrate AI into every aspect of its operations, improving productivity along the way.', 'The twin tailwinds of an improving economy and AI will drive Alphabet higher. Trading at just 2 times forward sales, the stock is a steal.', ""MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is likely the least well-known company on this list. It's the leading provider of e-commerce and digital payments services in Latin America, and business is brisk. In the third quarter, revenue climbed 69%, while operating income surged 194% -- despite generating record-setting growth last year."", ""This trend is expected to continue. The adoption of e-commerce in the region is among the fastest in the world, and with a population of nearly 668 million, it's twice the size of the U.S., so its pool of potential customers is much larger."", ""Add to that MercadoLibre's margin expansion and strong cash flow, and investors shouldn't sleep on this Latin American powerhouse."", 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) suffered from the same headwinds as its tech rivals but responded by kicking off the AI gold rush with a $13 billion investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. What followed was a flurry of activity, integrating generative AI tools across its suite of products and services and AI cloud offerings. Its AI-fueled digital assistant Copilot is seeing robust demand, the headliner in the ""fastest-growing $10 billion business"" in Microsoft\'s history.', ""The demand is unmistakable. Microsoft's Azure cloud revenue growth outpaced rivals in the calendar third quarter, with three percentage points of that growth attributable to demand for AI."", 'The stock is selling for 32 times forward earnings, particularly reasonable in light of its prospects.', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) processors have long been the gold standard for gaming, data center, and artificial intelligence (AI) use cases, capitalizing on the generative AI boom that hit last year. The resulting shortage of AI chips is expected to persist through 2024. Nvidia ramped up production to meet the accelerating demand and continues pouring money into research and development, creating ever-improving solutions.', ""The company has generated triple-digit year-over-year revenue and profit growth in each of the past two quarters, and soaring demand for AI is expected to continue. Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 is cheaper than the broader market, making this stock a steal."", 'With decades of experience under its belt, Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) was ready when AI went viral last year. The company quickly pivoted, adding generative AI models to its repertoire, which work hand in hand with Palantir\'s AI-powered data analytics. The resulting Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has generated robust interest, and management said, ""Demand for AIP is unlike anything we have seen in the past 20 years.""', 'The stock might seem pricey at 11 times forward sales, but with four successive quarters of profitability, Palantir is ""eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500,"" management noted on the company\'s recent earnings call. As one of the few pure-play AI stocks out there, Palantir is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing AI gold rush.', ""Despite a punishing couple of years, Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) remains the world's most widely used streaming platform, with 51% of the market. The dearth of ad spending last year has begun to lift, and with multiple viewers across its 76 million active accounts, it's a compelling opportunity advertisers can't ignore, fueling ad growth on its platform."", 'Furthermore, the secular tailwinds of cord-cutting and the deterioration of broadcast viewing have caused an ongoing advertising shift from broadcast to streaming. Roku is the one place to reach these highly engaged viewers, who consumed 26.7 billion hours, or roughly 3.9 hours per day. And at roughly 3 times forward sales, investors are getting a bargain.', 'With the downturn largely in the rearview mirror, things are looking up for Shopify (NYSE: SHOP).

The fund holds 421 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for just 26.7% of assets, so there is minimal concentration risk here. Below is an overview of DGRO’s top 10 holdings from TipRanks’ holdings tool.', 'The fund holds many blue-chip companies that have grown their dividend payouts for years. While the fund’s top holding, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), is more often thought of as a growth stock than a dividend stock, it has increased its payout for 19 years in a row.', 'Microsoft is a good example of why investing in dividend growth stocks is a sound strategy. While Microsoft’s dividend yield of 0.7% doesn’t sound like much to get excited about, the growing dividend combined with the stock’s strong performance over the years has generated excellent results for its shareholders. Microsoft has produced a total return of over 1,200% over the past decade.', 'Given this dazzling total return, I don’t think many Microsoft shareholders are complaining about the 0.7% dividend yield.', 'Broadcom’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) performance tells a similar story. Broadcom’s dividend yield of 1.9%, while higher than Microsoft’s, doesn’t really sound like much to write home about. However, Broadcom has increased its dividend payout for 13 years in a row. Plus, Broadcom’s incredible total return of 2,610% over the past decade surpasses even Microsoft’s gaudy performance.', 'The strong performances of Microsoft and Broadcom illustrate why looking for consistent dividend growth can be a more effective strategy than simply looking for high yields.', 'Meanwhile, additional top 10 holdings like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) are Dividend Aristocrats/Dividend Kings that have increased their payouts for 25, 61, and 67 consecutive years, respectively.', 'DGRO is also diversified when it comes to market sectors. Its heaviest exposure is to financials, although this sector accounts for a weighting of just 18.4%, so less than one-fifth of the fund. Healthcare has a weighting of 17.7%, information technology weighs in at 17.0%, industrials come in at 11.9%, and consumer staples make up 10.6% of assets. No other sector accounts for a weighting of more than 10%.', 'DGRO’s top holdings are also highly rated by TipRanks’ Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating.', 'Eight out of DGRO’s top 10 holdings boast Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or higher. Even better, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) and Broadcom feature ‘Perfect 10’ Smart Scores, placing them on the list of Top Smart Score Stocks. DGRO features an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8.', 'Another nice thing about DGRO’s portfolio is that while it features many blue-chip dividend growth stocks, it isn’t overly expensive from a valuation perspective. The ETF’s P/E ratio of 18.7 isn’t incredibly cheap, but it’s noticeably cheaper than the S&P 500’s (SPX) P/E ratio of 21.6.', 'DGRO’s strategy of investing in companies that grow their dividends sustainably has translated into solid results over time.\xa0As of December 31, 2023, the fund posted an annualized return of 8.8% over a three-year time frame and an impressive annualized return of 12.9% over a five-year time frame.', 'On a cumulative basis, the fund has posted a nice total return of 83.3% over the past five years and an impressive 170.3% since its inception in 2014.', 'Cost is another area where DGRO shines. Its ultra-low expense ratio of just 0.08% means an investor will pay just $8 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually. Assuming that this expense ratio stays constant at 0.08% and the fund returns 5% per year, an investor allocating $10,000 into the fund will pay just $103 over a 10-year investment time frame. Low-cost ETFs like DGRO help investors save money and build their portfolios over time.', 'Turning to Wall Street, DGRO earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 301 Buys, 110 Holds, and 11 Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average DGRO stock price target of $58.29 implies 8.07% upside potential.', 'The iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF is a sound choice for investors looking to park some of their money, no matter what the market may bring in 2024. The fund owns a large and diversified selection of blue-chip dividend growth stocks that have both appreciated in value and increased their dividend payouts over time.', 'The popular ETF has grown its own dividend payout for nine years in a row and put up double-digit annualized returns over the last five years (as of December 31). The fund is also viewed favorably by analysts and is rated highly by TipRanks’ proprietary Smart Score system.', 'Lastly, DGRO offers investors an extremely cost-effective expense ratio of just 0.08%, making it an appealing holding for the long term. For these reasons, I’m bullish on this strong dividend growth ETF for 2024 and beyond.', 'Disclosure']"

It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD\'s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD\'s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD.

Gentlemen, great to have you both here for the New Year."", 'Jason Moser: Hey.', 'Matt Argersinger: Happy New Year.', ""Dylan Lewis: We've got a big name cutting its dividend. Some inspiration for folks getting back on top of their finances in the New Year and of course, stocks on our radar. We're going to kick off today carrying forward one of the big themes of 2023. Matt, the Magnificent Seven companies did a lot of the heavy lifting in 2023, leading to a lot of the big gains especially in the major indices. Where do some of those companies sit now?"", ""Matt Argersinger: Yes, they certainly did their share last year, Dylan. If you look at the seven companies, let's start with Alphabet, 2023 returns 58%, Amazon 81%, Apple the laggard 49%, Meta one of the big winners 194%, Microsoft 58%, and Nvidia the big winner 239%, and Tesla with a pedestrian 101% or a double last year. You average all that together and the Magnificent Seven more than doubled and remember, these are the biggest companies in the S&P 500 in the market. Apple with $3 trillion market cap, Microsoft and Meta, well over $1 trillion. What I think is interesting looking at the Magnificent Seven coming into this year though, and after these huge returns they had last year. If you look at the forward earnings multiple for these businesses, let's go through the list again. Alphabet 21 times forward earnings. Not terribly expensive, just a little bit above market. Amazon more expensive at 43 times earnings. Apple at 29 times earnings, Meta, the cheapest one, 20 times earnings. Microsoft, 33 times earnings. Nvidia, as you might expect, 40 times earnings, pretty expensive there, and Tesla the most expensive at 63 times forward earnings. Average all that out and you end up with a forward earnings multiple for the group of 35. That's well above market. If you look at the S&P 500, about 19 times forward earnings, the equal weight S&P 500 at 16 times earnings and then if you go to small caps, a place where I'm spending a lot of time these days, you're at a 14 earnings multiple. These companies are expensive. Now, I would also argue though, these are among the best businesses out there, they deserve a premium valuation. I think the question is how much of a premium and given the run that these companies have had, given where they stand in terms of their valuation, I can understand why some of these might be getting a little sold off here to begin 2024. As this bull market broadens out a little more, people look to invest elsewhere and maybe these will tend to lag or certainly not do as well as they did last year. That would be crazy."", ""Dylan Lewis: Jason, I've seen a couple downgrades come in this week, particularly for Apple. Do you feel like some of that analyst pessimism is just a reflection on, hey, this company had a tremendous year, or is there a little bit more to that?"", ""Jason Moser: I think that's partly it, there's no question that Apple had a tremendous year, but as Matt noted, it was the laggard of the seven, it just modest 49% gains, [laughs] I think we're all very happy with that over the course of any year, but I think what's interesting when you look at Apple, and I think by the way, it's important to know with all of these companies, there's a difference between owning, and buying, maybe it's not the opportunity to buy right now, but we're not saying that these things are a point where you need to be selling. These are businesses that you want to own, just might not be the best opportunity to buy them or add to your positions, but interestingly, when you look at Apple and you consider these multiples, looking at where Apple is today, in the neighborhood of 30 times trailing earnings, you go back to 2019, it was like 15. We talk about multiple compression."", ""Well there's multiple expansion too and I think a lot of these companies, they've been very successful for a number of reasons, but we've seen a lot of multiple expansion when it comes to these Magnificent Seven. Certainly Apple to be sure because we went from essentially 15 times earnings in 2019 to around 30 today. That's something to keep in mind and then when you couple that with just this general idea, it's not a leap, to assume that maybe we're not going to be upgrading our iPhones as much. The phones are better, they last longer, I don't need to buy a new one every two years. Maybe it's just every three years now, maybe sooner, it'll be every other every four years."", ""But you look at Foxconn, we just saw news today from Foxconn. They reported a revenue drop for the final quarter of 2023. They saw a decline in December, they're seeing year of year decline in sales for the first quarter of 2024. This matters because Fox Con is the leading iPhone assembler, or a big supplier of Apple's. So that's a good indicator maybe, of some of the challenges on Apple's horizon as it regards to hardware, as it relates to hardware. The one thing, the question I think with Apple now is just regard to services, we talked about Apple being a services company. Is that somewhere where Apple will be able to make up for some lost ground yet to be determined? But what we're seeing is even the services revenue, that that's starting to slow down as well. Again, not saying that Apple is a bad idea and not saying sell your Apple, but hey, I do get the pessimism there, maybe this is a time to sit back and let this thing come back to a little bit."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, Knowing the cycle of financial news in the way that the media tends to work, I can anticipate six months from now after this great year that these seven companies had maybe some tough results, maybe some tough comps and those articles being out there saying, the Magnificent Seven is not so much in 2024, is the take on these companies right now basically, if we see declines in these prices, they're probably pretty attractive opportunities to hop in?"", ""Matt Argersinger: Yeah, I think I heard on the airwaves somewhere this week it was like the Mag Seven could become the Lag Seven in 2024. No, I would say I own a few of these companies and any meaningful pullback, you're still buying best-of-breed businesses. These companies have pricing power, they're non-cyclical, recurring revenue, just beasts of businesses and I think any discount, especially if you got back to close to a market multiple, these companies deserve a premium. I would say. That's when you step in and say, yeah, there's opportunity there for sure."", ""Jason Moser: When they hit Lugubrious Seven, that's when you really start to thinking about buying more shares. Lugubrious Seven. Don't, not Lag Seven. Let's be smart about this Lugubrious."", 'Matt Argersinger: Someone is right in that.', ""Dylan Lewis: Studying the dictionary over the holiday break, I'm going to look that one afterwards."", ""Matt Argersinger: I've got a daughter that was taking the SAT test recently."", ""Dylan Lewis: [laughs] It is that special time of the year when the wrapping paper and the wreckage of the holidays is out of the house. The new toys all have their batteries and we've got some numbers to make sense of the past holiday shopping season. In addition to shopping, it seems like Jason's been doing a little bit of reading, but I'm going to ask him to check in on the retail picture for the holiday season. As you look back on what we've seen in some of the data we got out there, Jason. What do you think the headline is?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, we saw a headline this week. Adobe Analytics called out online spending for this holiday season, it was up 5% to just over $222 billion for the month of November and December. So modest growth there I feel like my holiday spending was a little bit more than 5% maybe I'm adding a little bit to that. The big theme though, across the board though, it wasn't really more spending on more things, it was lower prices. We saw discounts really come into play this holiday season. I think 31%, we saw a peak discount, 31% off a listed price in electronics versus 25% from a year ago, 24% for apparel, versus 19% from a year ago. Ultimately, we saw shoppers really focusing on those discounts. They bought more things, but they weren't necessarily paying more for them. I think one of the concerns that stands out and we're talking a little bit about this in production was just in regard to how people are spending. We know the consumer is stretched. Buy now, pay later. This is something that's going to be a tool that consumers use going forward. If it's something that helps sellers sell and it helps consumers buy, then, it's going to stick around, I think. But it really needs to find its place in our financial landscape here because as we see buy now, pay later take a bigger role in how people are spending their money and it's a bigger role. It was $16.6 billion in online spending year over the holiday season, up 14% from a year ago. We need to really make sure this is something that the credit ratings agencies see, that merchants see, so that we understand really where the consumers stand because I think the problem, what we're seeing right now, is that consumers are using buy now, pay later in addition to credit cards. Tapping out those credit cards and then going to buy now pay later, which just puts you more in debt and that can be a scary thing."", ""Dylan Lewis: In addition to the update from Adobe Analytics, we also saw some data from Mastercard showing US retail sales up 3%. E-commerce doing the heavy lifting there, but brick and mortar also playing a role at 2.2% growth year over year. Matt, are you like Jason, are you contributing to the growth that we're seeing?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I contribute plenty of growth this season for sure and I'm glad you mentioned the brick and mortar because I think that was an area that a lot of people have given up for dead, but lots of customer traffic. I know some of the malls lined with two were just packed and so people were definitely getting out there and spending."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break. If you're thinking about canceling Netflix or Max, you're not alone. Is that a problem for streamers? Stay right here, you're listening to Motley Fool Money."", 'Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I\'m Dylan Lewis, joined over the airwaves by Fool analysts Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger. If you\'re looking at your credit card statements and saying, ""Do I really need to be subscribed four different streaming services?"" You are in growing company. Jason, to borrow a phrase from former Grubhub CEO Matt Maloney. Streaming customers are becoming more and more promiscuous and willing to jump and join other services and cancel. We\'re seeing more rotation.', ""Jason Moser: That words such an attention getter. Promiscuous. It's like nope, we're talking about streaming. Listen, I personally, it feels like to me, we've hit the ceiling. This is unsustainable at this point. Consolidation is going to have to happen in order for some of these streamers to be able to stay in business. I mean, at the beginning of the year, I like going through and doing a little bit of a checking account audit, credit card statement audit to see exactly what we're all subscribed to. Because it really does add up. It does seem like we're headed for a world with a big four. Something like a Netflix, some Hulu combo, maybe Amazon, and then Max. Then you've got all of other niche players in there that are figuring out ways to be part of bigger packages. I mean, you got Horizon out there talking about offering a suite of Netflix and Warner Bros. Discoveries, HBO Max. Then you've got possibility of Apple saddling up with Paramount Plus, I mean to me this is all stuff that's going to continue. It does, it feels like we're going back to the bundle. I mean, in simple terms, we're going back to some bundle because honestly, that's where you see the most value. I look at this just from our perspective and in our household, we have Hulu Live."", ""But with that, of course, we get the ESPN+ and all that, the Disney+. All of that together. Yeah, it's a little bit of a more expensive bill than just your simple streaming service, but we're getting so much. It's like cable like almost. I suspect we're going to continue to see this, but I think this also really speaks to the value of having the ad-supported option as well. That's why we're seeing Netflix introduced. We saw Amazon just rolling this out. Clearly, it's part of Hulu's model all along. But that really, I think, enables these companies to keep, or at least potentially keep more subscribers without them necessarily defecting completely. Instead of cutting your subscription, maybe you just downgrade it to an ad supported model until you decide to reupgrade. Then you're seeing Netflix as an example there. Where they're trying to figure out ways to monetize gaming. Gaming being part of not only the engagement in keeping people in the universe, but also new sources of monetization. It's a really interesting space. I think 2024 is where we're going to see a real shake out here. A lot of consolidation. Not going to surprise me at all."", ""Dylan Lewis: In addition to the new year kicking off, we have earning season kicking off as the calendar page turns. Some of the earlier reporters got the party started this week and Matt, we saw a bit of a shock from Walgreens. Not so much in the earnings headline numbers but in the company's plans for its cash."", ""Matt Argersinger: Not so much a party over there at Walgreens lately. But yeah, they slashed their dividend from 0.48-0.25 It's the first dividend cut, by the way, in 45 years for Walgreens. It is or I should say it was a Dividend Aristocrat®, meaning it was a member of this really elite group of S&P 500 companies that have raised their dividend for 25 consecutive years as defined by S&P Global. This was a monumental move because, Walgreens CEO can say, we're doing this because we want to turn around the business. We want to show up the balance sheet, we want to reinvest and the dividend, it's costing about 800 million annual cash flow. We can save that money, it'll enable us to pay down debt, etc. But history is not on Walgreens side here. Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds did a really neat long-term study of the S&P 500 covering 50 years from 1973 to the end of 2022. The average stock in the S&P 500 returned 7.7% annually. The average dividend paying company returned 9.2% annually. The average company that cut its dividend returned a -0.6% annually. That's over 50 years. You can believe Walgreens is making the right business decision. But historically, if you look at most companies, a dividend cut is almost always a signal, a poor performance ahead. Here's a bad comp for Walgreens, VF Corp, bigger apparel brand owner. They had raised their dividend 50 consecutive years going into last year. They finally cut their dividend about a year ago. The stock is down some 70% since the cut. If I'm a Walgreen shareholder, I might think they're making the right business decision. It might not be the best long-term decision for the stock. It could be a really bad signal."", ""Dylan Lewis: Anytime we see any adjustments to those dividend policies, we know how sacred those dividends can be and just how important they are to investors. It's not a decision that management teams take lightly. We are going to see more earnings reports pick up over the course of the month. I want to get a little preview. Jason, as we see more businesses report over the coming weeks, what are you paying attention to? Is there any business in particular that you're watching?"", ""Jason Moser: I'm actually looking forward to Cloudflare's report here. I think that'll come out later in February. But you go back to just April of 2023. They reported the first quarter earnings where the stock just got pummeled. It was sub $40 per share. That was based essentially on, what we then heard for the rest of the year was all of these enterprise customers, pinching the purse strings, really watching that spending. Cloudflare, which has always been valued at a premium, still working its way toward sustainable profitability. But I mean, they guided down just slightly. They guided down somewhere in the neighborhood of 4% on the top line. At that point, they said they still were going to grow that top line, 31.5% and the market still just punished the stock. But you fast forward to today and clearly there's been a strong recovery in the business. If you look at just the most recent quarters results, I mean the key performance indicators remain impressive, large customers are growing and spending more money. They're still guiding for what they expect to see 32% top line growth for the full year. Around 28-29% for this quarter that they're getting ready to report. That's going to be a company I'm keeping my eye on."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, what about you? What's the name that you're watching this earnings season?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I'm looking at Vail Resorts here. Now they don't report until early March. They're one of those off cycle reporters. But this is a critical quarter for Vail because it encompasses the results through January. That first big month of the ski season, and Vail had a really tough 2022, 2023 ski season. They had tough weather conditions in the West, they had very little snow in the East. They've taken on a lot of debt recently. They've made a lot of big acquisitions and some big capital investments in the resorts. This has to be a really good ski season I think to support continued investment, keep the dividend growing. I'm a shareholder, so both of those things are important to me. But also I think Vail Resorts will tell us a little bit about the state consumer spending, particularly at the high end. If there's weakness in their resort revenues, in their ancillary businesses, in the traffic they're seeing to their mountains, into their resorts, into their restaurants, that might be a signal that we're finally seeing a consumer pull back a little bit. I think that could signal that we might be headed to a bit of an economic downturn. Especially if a lot of those buy now pay later, people are going to those resorts. They booked all these vacations on there. I'm a little worried about that after some of the things Jason said."", ""Dylan Lewis: Well, Matt, I can personally speak to the conditions on the ground on the East Coast Resorts. I spent new years in the Poconos and went to Blue Mountain and all that was on the ground was blown snow. There was not a lake of snow, just just a thin vein of snow going down the mountain as you rolled up from a distance. I don't know if that picture is going to change anytime soon, but I awfully hope it does."", ""Matt Argersinger: I sure hope it does too, cause I'm flying out to Utah at the end of the month, so to do some skiing out near Park City. Hoping for snow, we'll put the call out there for listeners as well. We will appreciate the snow reports and the resort reports."", ""Dylan Lewis: If you're out there, podcast@fool.com is where you can send them. Jason, Matt, we're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next, Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner explains why the future is so bright. You got to wear shades. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. We're back in the studio for the first time in 2024, and the New Year means a renewed interest in all topics, money and investing. This week I caught up with Motley Fool co-founder, chief rule breaker, and host of the Rule Breaker Investing podcast, David Gardner. David walked me through some timeless investing advice and give an optimistic look forward to kick off the New Year. David, thanks so much for joining me."", 'David Gardner: Happy New Year, Dylan. Happy New Year, everyone.', ""Dylan Lewis: It's great to kick off 2024, and it's great to do it with you here on the show. Every time the calendar page turns over into January, I know a lot of people, especially a lot of our listeners, check in on their finances, and they start to make some goals about their investing life and what they want to be doing with money over the year. You've been speaking to investors new and old for such a long time. I wanted to start out with you and some advice for two different groups. First off, some of the folks that are coming into investing and are maybe new to investing, maybe what your advice would be for them."", ""David Gardner: It's longer term than you think. I truly believe that many people who come new to investing think that it's trading when it's not. It's investing, and there's a really important difference. Trading is shorter term. It's practiced often by people down on floors like futures traders, bond traders, professional people. There are also people who buy their big PC with their trading station and day trade watching CNBC. Most of our Foolish listeners, new and old, won't be like that. But just to understand, that's such the temper of the times. That's how people often think. They watch CNBC, and it's a minute to minute thing, and so they start with such a short term mentality. If you're an investor with us, capital F, a Foolish investor, you're thinking about it for the rest of your life you should be invested all the way through adding, adding, adding, rarely selling. Unless you don't believe in that thing anymore, and you can change out that money to something else, so I would say to the new investors, understand the proper mentality, the right mindset for what is investing. A beautiful word, the antithesis of trading."", 'Dylan Lewis: David, what about people that have been investing for a while and maybe have been investing the Foolish way where they are long term buyers and owners of businesses?', ""David Gardner: Yeah, keep it up because you know what? There are a lot of countervailing forces that try to stop you from keeping it up. Huge market gyrations, we've seen that over the last few years. A huge up, a huge down, and a pretty great year back up last year. I'm not all the way back Dylan to my 2021 highs. I don't know about you, friend, but a lot of us are probably not. If you've been with Motley Fool for a while, you're probably not back to your all time highs yet, but you shouldn't be that far. I understand some of us started with The Fool three years ago when the market was about to tank. Others started three decades ago. We've seen this time and time again and all that really matters is not what happened last year, 2023 or 10 years ago, but what happens next? For me, what happens next is usually good. I think the market's going up this year, two years in three it does. So just understand what you tell yourself in your head during bad times often is the hardest thing you need to overcome as a Foolish investor. I would also just add as maybe an appendix to that. Dylan, take a look over the stocks in your portfolio. Are these all companies that you esteem? Would you be proud if that company takes over the world in the next 10 years? Is it a better world? It's so important to me as a conscious capitalist that each of us realizes the money that is in our portfolios is really shaping the future, truly in its own small way, in aggregate, in a huge way. I would say make your portfolio reflect your best vision for our future and from time to time, we need to just review and see if that's still true."", ""Dylan Lewis: David, it's as if you had my portfolio statement in front of you. I am off of all time highs, but still well above where I was before the pandemic. A big part of that is the success of companies that I have owned for quite some time and have enjoyed owning, will continue to own. One of those businesses, for me, is Axon. It's been an incredible performer and certainly a business that I want to own as I see the future unfold because I think it can play a very large and critical part in it. It's also a business I have learned so much from by following and just understanding where the world has gone. When I look at Axon, for example, I see the migration to Cloud being such a large part of that story. That's huge and a really critical part of The Fool ethos, learning from businesses that we invest in. I'm curious as we look out, are there any names in your mind, maybe from the past year or from recent memory, that you feel like you've learned a lot from?"", ""David Gardner: Well, first of all, I think every stock tells a story. If you stuck with that stock, you lengthened the story, and it became a more important, deeper story that you learn more from. If you're just jumping in, jumping out, you're not going to learn too much. But we certainly love stories at The Motley Fool, and you're a wonderful storyteller, Dylan. You talk to other people who tell stories, and that's what I'm about to do is tell a story. The one I wanted to talk about here is Nvidia, because Nvidia has ended up becoming the greatest stock pick in Motley Fool Stock Advisor history as of now. It's good to look at our exemplars. It's good to look at excellence and what really wins, and understand and learn from that. So can I just tell a little bit of the story of Nvidia?"", 'Dylan Lewis: Of course.', ""David Gardner: Let's do it. Settle down here by the campfire. I hope friends and family maybe outsider, and let's talk briefly this weekend about Nvidia, which I first picked on. It was Tax Day, April 15th, 2005. The stock was at $1.64. These are all split adjusted prices. It's a very successful graphics card company so they're making, if you like, computer games than I do. They're making cards that give you better graphics, graphic processing units, what Nvidia was bringing. That's what attracted me to them at the time. By October 2007, so two years later it's gone from a buck 64 to 10. So a six bagger feeling great. Now those of us who remember market history know 2007, things are probably peaking somewhere right around now. But six bagger two years later, for all our Stock Advisor members, couldn't be more excited about Nvidia. By the end of 2008, it had dropped from 10 to below $1.50, so there we are with our six bagger. Three years later, we're now under water on the pick, but we stick with it. By the end of 2014, it's back to five, so half where it was seven years earlier, but still a three bagger nine years after we picked it. So it's back to five 2016 two years later, big moment, it crosses 10. Ten where it had been. In October 2007 we're back. By the end of that year, it has tripled from 7.5-22.5 2016. It is the top performing stock on the S&P 500, so our cost basis is $1.64, and we're back to 22.5 we've held over a decade through. Just crazy times. I'm going to give myself a little bit props at this point. Because as I thought about what stock do I want to rerecommend at the start of 2017, there was a lot of reporting about how Nvidia had been the top performer on the S&P 500 the previous year. Most people get afraid then. They think, well, revert to the mean, what goes up must come down. But trying to be the Foolish rule breaker that I am, I made that my new pick to start 2017. So yes, 12 years later, I'm picking it again to buy with fresh money and just a month after it closed out, the best year for the S&P 500 of any other of the 499 stocks. So 2017 rerec. It goes from 22.5 that year to 52.5. It turns out you can be the top performer and a year later you can more than double again, so 2018, it's gone from 52.5-70. I hope this isn't boring, but we're almost on this shaggy dog story. But in 2018, having just hit 70, it goes 70-30. Wham-o, I think some of us will remember."", ""Crypto was like a big thing for Nvidia, also the idea like AI, and AI and cars and other things like that. Some of that slowed down and some of the crypto hype was subsiding. That really hurt Nvidia stock. It gets cut in half that year, but by early 2020 it crosses 70 again and by the end of 2020 it's at $130 a share. Remember, our cost basis is $1.64. Really nice then when in 2021 it goes from 130 to over $300 a share. As we hit the penultimate chapter of this long story of association 18 years and counting with Nvidia, we learned that in 2022, the stock ends up dropping from just over 300 to just over 100. You had a near trillion dollar company, Dylan and fellow Fools everywhere that lost two thirds of its value in a single year, 2022. Not so long ago, but today we're back over 200. Back over 300. Back over 400. It recently touched 500, though it's around 475 or so as we close out this week. It's been a 295 bagger for Motley Fool Stock Advisor members of Vintage 2005 who are, I hope you are still holding. All you had to do was just hold for 18.5 years now and counting. I think there's so much to have learned from that story. Many people don't have long associations with stocks, but when you can, A, invest for the long term, the only term that counts, and B, find great companies. You just learned so much. Your eyes are opened to what investing truly is. But you have to let it take time. I would suggest the rest of your life."", 'Dylan Lewis: I love that story, David, because I think so many lessons there, and also because there are probably a lot of people that first started following Nvidia this past year as it entered the Magnificent Seven and became this massive, unavoidable success story. I love that. It has been a long march for this company and the people that have followed it and held it for that entire time have been incredibly well rewarded for doing so.', ""David Gardner: It's not the only one I could tell similar stories around stocks that we've recommended in Stock Advisor. Netflix, which was when I retired from stock picking in May of 2021, that was the big performer. That was the 200 plus bagger. Of course, having picked Amazon a long time ago back in our AOL day is still holding. That's really been the best stock pick of my life. But these are all great stories. What you choose to learn from the stories, you take away, another great stock we've picked Apple. How many people had Apple at some point, but maybe their money doubled and so they sold out. Or maybe it had a bad quarter and they thought, people are saying Apple's too high right now, whatever it is, you end up not learning and not prospering from some of the best instincts that you had. Returning to what I said a few minutes ago, Dylan, if we are making our portfolio reflect our best vision for our future and you just stay focused there, I bet your vision for the future isn't changing as often as stock prices do. I bet your best vision for our future is not changing as frequently as the pundits do, changing their minds on this so called Magnificent Seven, a phrase I don't really use too often because it's the Johnny come lately FAANG stock like group, a bunch of companies, many of which we've held for years and years, that just did really well and create a cute label for them. I'm not trying to demean it, but I'm just like, it's so short term and it's missing the bigger picture."", ""Dylan Lewis: I hope I didn't offend you there, David."", ""David Gardner: Not at all. No. Believe me, I have a long list of pet peeves. I do them on my podcast once a year or so. I'll air out eight or ten more. That is a pet peeve that predates you, Dylan, and it's really as much about the FAANG stocks. Do you remember that phrase?"", 'Dylan Lewis: Of course.', ""David Gardner: I've been using that a lot of these are the same companies just in different clothes like Magnificent Seven. Most of those are the same stocks that were there. But when Jim Kramer especially was playing up FAANG stocks, my big point was well, it's great to have them or be aware of these companies, the Magnificent Seven, or seven of the great companies in the world today. I'm not going to demean that, but the real question that I would have is for anybody who's talking about Magnificent Seven, what is your Magnificent Seven score? Your Magnificent Seven score is, you add up the number of years that you've held each of those stocks in the Magnificent Seven, and that is much more important than that you had them at the end of this year window dressing your professional mutual fund portfolio, or telling your friends over eggnog that you own some Nvidia. To me it's about the years, and that's the point that will rarely be made in popular media, and that is the point that matters more than anything else."", ""Dylan Lewis: You mentioned your pet peeve series there with RBI. You have many series and many recurring volumes with RBI. One of my favorites is your quote series. You have your great quote volumes and I'm curious. We always look for wisdom, we always look for inspiration as we head into the New Year. Are there any quotes that are really ringing in your head right now?"", 'David Gardner: I love great quotes and obviously having now done 17 episodes with a new group five quotes every time, I guess I\'m up to nearly 100 great quotes. I am somebody, it sounds like you are too Dylan and I\'m somebody who loves finding the most used. It\'s across different cultures, across different time periods. But finding those things and sticking with them and in good times and bad is really helpful for all of us as investors, business people, and fellow livers of life. Let me close with one that somebody I know and esteem, but it didn\'t know, he said it. But it\'s Frank Lloyd Wright, the American architect. I love this line. ""The longer I live, the more beautiful life becomes."" I hope that\'s true for you. Whoever\'s listening right now, I hope that\'s true. We have the ups and downs. Every day is not beautiful, every market year is not beautiful. But I hope the longer you hold Nvidia, the longer you do the thing that you do, whatever it is, the thing that you do, the people that you love, the longer that you\'re here with us, I hope the more beautiful life becomes. It did for Frank Lloyd Wright, apparently, and I would say it did for me and I\'m looking forward to several more decades on this planet.', ""Dylan Lewis: After we wrapped up taping, David asked me, what's the cutoff for wishing someone a happy new year? I said, January 12th, listeners, we want to know what you think. You can send your New Year's greeting cutoff date to podcast at fool.com, and of course, you can always send questions for our analysts and ideas for the show there too as well. Coming up after the break, Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser return the couple stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. Don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis joined again by Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser. We've got radar stocks in a minute but first gentlemen, it appears there is a limit to pricing power. European grocer Carrefour is dropping Pepsi products from stores after the company's run of price increases. Tough news if you're trying to get Doritos in Belgium, but may be understandable given the increases we've seen. Jason, what is a snack with unlimited pricing power in the Moser household?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, my wife will tell you, I have the tooth of salt, not of sweet, so I can spend irrationally on some Dot's Pretzels, all flavors I do not discriminate, and a staple that I'm always on board with is extra toasty cheeses."", ""Dylan Lewis: I love Dot's Pretzels. That was a new snack for me in 2023, and one that is a staple of my pantry. Now, Matt, what about you? What has pricing power?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I'm a big fan of SunChips. I think they're a Pepsi product, especially the garden salsa flavor. I think if my grocery store didn't sell them anymore, I'd be sad. But generally, I'm a big fan of just roasted salted cashews or almonds, or really any nuts, I can't get enough. Unfortunately, bags of those run like $10 these days. But I can't help myself."", ""Dylan Lewis: We got some salty palates here. Let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our men behind the glass, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question. Jason, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?"", ""Jason Moser: Digging a little bit more into a company called UiPath, Ticker is PATH. They build and manage automation and computer vision technology. They do this through their business automation platform that ultimately spans the full automation spectrum. Examples of what this can be used for, think of healthcare, where they can actually help automate EMR, electronic medical record work flows, claim systems, document management, and data transfer. They make money from the sale of their software licenses in their SaaS business subscriptions. They integrate with offerings from companies like Adobe, Atlassian, CrowdStrike, Salesforce, and more. So this really does expand the audience and the use cases for the company, The co-founders and also co CEOs, you've got Daniel Dines and Rob Insulin, they're still leading the way. Dines, interestingly owns more than 19% of the company still. It's a very interesting business playing into a lot of the tail ones we talk about with AI and in automation and machine learning and whatnot. Still working its way to profitability though and valuation today is still a big risk."", ""Dylan Lewis: We'd go on the entire show without talking AI and here Jason brings it up toward the end. Dan, a question about UiPath?"", 'Dan Boyd: Not going to lie. When I saw the name of this company, I thought they would be like some sort of med tech stock that did stuff with urinary tract infections. Terrible name for a company regardless of what they do.', 'Dylan Lewis: Mostly a comment it seems. Kicking us off strong. Matt, what is on your radar this week?', ""Matt Argersinger: Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, ticker PEB, can always count on me to find these small obscure REITs that nobody cares about. But I think more investors should care about Pebblebrook. This is a REIT that really suffered obviously in the aftermath of COVID 19, business for their hotels and resorts basically shut down for several months and it was very slow to bounce back. But here we are today. Hotel occupancy revenues are almost back to pre pandemic levels. The company has sold off some of its non-core assets, paid down a lot of debt, no major debt maturities now until October 2025, and management has been buying back a lot of stock. That's rare for a REIT, in fact, the CEO himself has personally acquired over 300,000 shares since 2020 and I expect a big dividend raise this year. Feels like a hidden gem to me in Reitland."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Pebblebrook Hotel Trust.', ""Dan Boyd: Matt, you said this stock has suffered since the pandemic, but looking at their stock price, it seems like they've been suffering since about 2015. Any thoughts on that? [laughs]"", ""Matt Argersinger: That's a good call, Dan. I think they extended themselves beyond their kind of core boutique resort asset in those years, and so I think they've done a good job of kind of selling a lot of this off, getting to a debt lower. I expect better years ahead."", ""Dylan Lewis: Dan, which one's on your list?"", ""Dan Boyd: Bad name, good company, UiPath, let's go."", ""Dylan Lewis: Love it.

EDA is a type of computer-aided design suite specifically for chips and computing systems. To start 2024, industry leader Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ: CDNS) is making an acquisition to double down on its most critical EDA-related services: custom silicon design.', ""The company being acquired is a small engineering team called Invecas, which will be added to Cadence's Silicon Solutions Group. Here's what investors need to know."", ""First, let's address the big question first: Is Cadence stock a buy right now? After an epic 70% increase in 2023, this stock isn't cheap. Shares trade for nearly 40 times the expected earnings per share in 2024 and about 45 times the expected 2024 free cash flow."", 'Invecas isn\'t going to do much to further boost those already high 2024 expectations. In the press release announcing the acquisition, Cadence said, ""the terms of the transaction were not disclosed"" (which almost always means the purchase was for a small sum of money) and that the addition of the Invecas engineering team will ""be immaterial to Cadence\'s total revenue and earnings this year.""', 'This is a drastically different strategy from the biggest EDA software company Synopsys, which is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire physics simulation and design software company Ansys. Synopsys currently has a market cap of $76 billion, and Ansys at nearly $31 billion, so this would be a megamerger if the rumors prove true.', ""For investors looking for value, Cadence and its newly acquired prize likely aren't going to cut it. But if long-term growth from AI and other advanced software needs is what you're looking for in an investment, read on."", 'So why would Cadence ink such an immaterial deal, let alone make an announcement about it, when industry peers and heavyweights are making bolder moves?', 'Software applications, and especially AI (not just the ones made famous by ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Nvidia), are radically increasing the complexity of semiconductor design. Semiconductor technologies like 3D architectures (stacking different chip types atop each other to shrink overall size and improve performance) and chiplets (utilizing smaller chips for specific functions and connecting them using tiny networking features rather than a monolithic chip to handle all chip system functions) are needed to continue boosting software performance. Many companies utilizing advanced software -- automakers, healthcare providers, manufacturers -- need all the help they can get with custom chip design solutions.', ""Invecas has a track record of successful custom engineering work across many industries and already uses Cadence's design tools. Adding it to its list of services directly, Cadence plus Invecas can approach more non-semiconductor companies in need of custom silicon solutions to meet their product and software service needs."", 'Cadence has its own track record of successfully plugging in smaller peers like this into its own platform to stoke ever-increasing profitable growth over the years.', ""Nevertheless, it's important to reiterate the high premium Cadence stock trades for right now. I like this EDA company's strategy, and it has established itself as an integral part of the AI and advanced software supply chain. But I continue to believe a dollar-cost-average purchase plan would be best for any investor looking to play the long game in Cadence Design Systems stock."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Cadence Design Systems right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Cadence Design Systems, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Cadence Design Systems wasn't one of them.

According to an analysis of the Nasdaq Composite going back to 1971, the tech-heavy index has risen an average of 19% every year following a recovery year like we experienced in 2023. ', ""For investors, stock-split stocks can be a way to bet on the pattern continuing. Stock splits occur when a company divides each share into lower-priced units to make them more liquid and available to smaller investors. While these events don't impact company fundamentals, they are an encouraging sign that a stock is moving in the right direction. "", ""Let's discuss why two recently split stocks -- Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) -- could be great buys in the new year and beyond. "", ""Aside from a massive crash in 2022, Nvidia's stock has risen almost exponentially over the last decade. To keep prices down to Earth, its management has conducted five stock splits -- most recently, a 4-for-1 conversion in July 2021. And while shares have risen dramatically since then, it's not too late for investors to bet on continued success. "", ""Historically, Nvidia's growth has relied on its ability to take advantage of new technologies faster than rivals. This started with its graphics processing units (GPUs), which were initially designed to render video game visuals before finding another use in cryptocurrency mining. But generative artificial intelligence (AI) may be the big break that defines Nvidia's future for the foreseeable future. "", 'In the third quarter, AI chip sales helped send revenue up 206% year over year to $18.1 billion. With industry experts expecting the market for AI training hardware to expand from $45 billion to $400 billion by 2027, Nvidia has plenty of room for continued growth. ', ""To be fair, competition will probably increase. But Nvidia's economic moat comes from its speed to market, which has given it a robust developer community that has built software and servers around its hardware and may be reluctant to switch to less-compatible rivals."", 'Like Nvidia, Monster Beverage stock has risen dramatically over the past decade, leading to constant stock splits (six in total). The most recent conversion occurred in March of last year and gave investors two shares for each one they previously owned. And despite its $60 billion market cap, the energy drink maker still enjoys healthy business momentum. ', 'While net sales increased by a modest 14.3% year over year to $1.9 billion, the company enjoyed particularly impressive growth in its new alcohol business, which saw sales jump a whopping 58% to $42.3 million following the rollout of new products such as The Beast Unleashed line of malt alcohol drinks -- designed to appeal to its existing energy drink customers with similar flavors and branding.', ""Monster's burgeoning success in alcohol highlights its brand appeal and ability to use its existing supply chains and distribution networks to diversify its operations. "", 'With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31, Monster stock is slightly more expensive than the Nasdaq-100 average of 28. However, the premium looks justified, considering its bottom-line momentum. Third-quarter net income rose 40% year over year to $452 million. ', 'While stock splits and historical patterns can make investors more confident in putting money into the stock market, fundamentals should be the biggest consideration. Nvidia and Monster Energy have performed well in the past. But more importantly, both companies have what it takes to continue rewarding investors over the long term.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

The stock has gained 3,700% since taking its flagship beverage brand nationwide in March 2000.', ""However, the number of Celsius millionaires is probably fairly small. The stock's trading volume rose relatively slowly and four years is a short millionaire-minting period. Moreover, Celsius is not among the 100 most owned stocks on the Robinhood Markets\xa0brokerage today -- and I can't find any evidence that it ever ranked on that handy indicator of investor interest. Finally, Celsius Holdings isn't exactly an industry giant yet -- there are 650 companies with market caps larger than the energy drink maven's $13.8 billion."", ""These are early innings in Celsius' long-term growth game, and the company may make more people wealthy over time. But so far, its millionaire-making ability can't hold a candle to the moneymaking powers of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX)."", ""The media streaming pioneer's historical wealth-building muscle is undisputed:"", ""This stock does show up on Robinhood's list of most popular holdings, currently ranking 15th and showing up in all of the spot checks I did in data from the last four years."", ""Netflix's $209 billion market cap makes it the 42nd-largest stock on American exchanges today."", ""The rearview mirror shows a fantastic stock chart. Netflix nearly matched Celsius' 3,700% spurt with a 3,300% gain over the last 11 years, but also rose 727% in the 10 years before that. Thanks to the powers of compound returns, the all-time price increase works out to 39,800%."", ""Finally, Netflix's trading volume spiked early and often, with several significant volume jumps in the troughs before a then-upcoming price jump. Lots of investors took advantage of low prices on this long-term winner during challenges such as the Qwikster debacle and Blockbuster's DVD-mailing service."", ""It's fair to say that Netflix has made lots and lots of millionaires over the years. This is a high-octane growth story with decades of staying power. Strong business growth times years and years of enduring success equals game-changing business results -- and money making stock returns."", ""Netflix investors have enjoyed an average annual return of 31.9% over two decades and change, slowing down somewhat to a still-impressive 25.8% in the last decade. Mind you, both of these impressive gains include the horrible crash of 2022 when investors lost confidence in Netflix's growth story amid the inflation crisis and slower subscriber growth. At the bottom of that dark valley, Netflix shares had fallen 76% below the all-time highs of November 2021."", 'The stock is still recovering from that massive drawdown, currently trading 31% below the 2021 peak.', ""And that's a long-lasting buying opportunity in my book. You see, the brutal price drop was at least partly based on a big misunderstanding. Netflix's strategy shift is aimed at delivering exactly what bearish investors have been asking for over the last 20 years -- growing profits instead of grabbing subscribers at any cost."", ""This decision might cool the pace of new subscriptions, yet it aligns with a vision of enduring profitability and market relevance. Impressively, Netflix's current valuation paints a picture of affordability rarely seen before -- a mere 38 times its free cash flow. For investors, this not only signals a potentially undervalued gem, but also reflects Netflix's adaptability and foresight in an industry known for its relentless pace and unforgiving competition."", ""Remember, this is the company that dominated the video-rental market with a DVD-mailing service of its own invention, only to discard that proven success to refocus on the even larger digital streaming opportunity. Many Netflix investors ran for the exits when that sharp shift emerged in the summer of 2011, but it was obviously the right decision and people who bought Netflix stock in the Qwikster trough have made a mint since then. Doubling down on Netflix that fall was arguably the best investment I've ever made, and the current dip should look like another golden buying opportunity in the long run."", ""So I wish Celsius and its shareholders the best of luck, but its stock surge is very young and I don't know if the company can hold off challenges from larger and more established energy drink brands over time. Netflix, on the other hand, has proven its mettle time and again -- and I think it's a great investment right now."", ""Netflix's strategy shift brought some short-term volatility, but the company is positioned for long-term success. Feel free to invest accordingly."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Netflix wasn't one of them.

Gentlemen, great to have you both here for the New Year."", 'Jason Moser: Hey.', 'Matt Argersinger: Happy New Year.', ""Dylan Lewis: We've got a big name cutting its dividend. Some inspiration for folks getting back on top of their finances in the New Year and of course, stocks on our radar. We're going to kick off today carrying forward one of the big themes of 2023. Matt, the Magnificent Seven companies did a lot of the heavy lifting in 2023, leading to a lot of the big gains especially in the major indices. Where do some of those companies sit now?"", ""Matt Argersinger: Yes, they certainly did their share last year, Dylan. If you look at the seven companies, let's start with Alphabet, 2023 returns 58%, Amazon 81%, Apple the laggard 49%, Meta one of the big winners 194%, Microsoft 58%, and Nvidia the big winner 239%, and Tesla with a pedestrian 101% or a double last year. You average all that together and the Magnificent Seven more than doubled and remember, these are the biggest companies in the S&P 500 in the market. Apple with $3 trillion market cap, Microsoft and Meta, well over $1 trillion. What I think is interesting looking at the Magnificent Seven coming into this year though, and after these huge returns they had last year. If you look at the forward earnings multiple for these businesses, let's go through the list again. Alphabet 21 times forward earnings. Not terribly expensive, just a little bit above market. Amazon more expensive at 43 times earnings. Apple at 29 times earnings, Meta, the cheapest one, 20 times earnings. Microsoft, 33 times earnings. Nvidia, as you might expect, 40 times earnings, pretty expensive there, and Tesla the most expensive at 63 times forward earnings. Average all that out and you end up with a forward earnings multiple for the group of 35. That's well above market. If you look at the S&P 500, about 19 times forward earnings, the equal weight S&P 500 at 16 times earnings and then if you go to small caps, a place where I'm spending a lot of time these days, you're at a 14 earnings multiple. These companies are expensive. Now, I would also argue though, these are among the best businesses out there, they deserve a premium valuation. I think the question is how much of a premium and given the run that these companies have had, given where they stand in terms of their valuation, I can understand why some of these might be getting a little sold off here to begin 2024. As this bull market broadens out a little more, people look to invest elsewhere and maybe these will tend to lag or certainly not do as well as they did last year. That would be crazy."", ""Dylan Lewis: Jason, I've seen a couple downgrades come in this week, particularly for Apple. Do you feel like some of that analyst pessimism is just a reflection on, hey, this company had a tremendous year, or is there a little bit more to that?"", ""Jason Moser: I think that's partly it, there's no question that Apple had a tremendous year, but as Matt noted, it was the laggard of the seven, it just modest 49% gains, [laughs] I think we're all very happy with that over the course of any year, but I think what's interesting when you look at Apple, and I think by the way, it's important to know with all of these companies, there's a difference between owning, and buying, maybe it's not the opportunity to buy right now, but we're not saying that these things are a point where you need to be selling. These are businesses that you want to own, just might not be the best opportunity to buy them or add to your positions, but interestingly, when you look at Apple and you consider these multiples, looking at where Apple is today, in the neighborhood of 30 times trailing earnings, you go back to 2019, it was like 15. We talk about multiple compression."", ""Well there's multiple expansion too and I think a lot of these companies, they've been very successful for a number of reasons, but we've seen a lot of multiple expansion when it comes to these Magnificent Seven. Certainly Apple to be sure because we went from essentially 15 times earnings in 2019 to around 30 today. That's something to keep in mind and then when you couple that with just this general idea, it's not a leap, to assume that maybe we're not going to be upgrading our iPhones as much. The phones are better, they last longer, I don't need to buy a new one every two years. Maybe it's just every three years now, maybe sooner, it'll be every other every four years."", ""But you look at Foxconn, we just saw news today from Foxconn. They reported a revenue drop for the final quarter of 2023. They saw a decline in December, they're seeing year of year decline in sales for the first quarter of 2024. This matters because Fox Con is the leading iPhone assembler, or a big supplier of Apple's. So that's a good indicator maybe, of some of the challenges on Apple's horizon as it regards to hardware, as it relates to hardware. The one thing, the question I think with Apple now is just regard to services, we talked about Apple being a services company. Is that somewhere where Apple will be able to make up for some lost ground yet to be determined? But what we're seeing is even the services revenue, that that's starting to slow down as well. Again, not saying that Apple is a bad idea and not saying sell your Apple, but hey, I do get the pessimism there, maybe this is a time to sit back and let this thing come back to a little bit."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, Knowing the cycle of financial news in the way that the media tends to work, I can anticipate six months from now after this great year that these seven companies had maybe some tough results, maybe some tough comps and those articles being out there saying, the Magnificent Seven is not so much in 2024, is the take on these companies right now basically, if we see declines in these prices, they're probably pretty attractive opportunities to hop in?"", ""Matt Argersinger: Yeah, I think I heard on the airwaves somewhere this week it was like the Mag Seven could become the Lag Seven in 2024. No, I would say I own a few of these companies and any meaningful pullback, you're still buying best-of-breed businesses. These companies have pricing power, they're non-cyclical, recurring revenue, just beasts of businesses and I think any discount, especially if you got back to close to a market multiple, these companies deserve a premium. I would say. That's when you step in and say, yeah, there's opportunity there for sure."", ""Jason Moser: When they hit Lugubrious Seven, that's when you really start to thinking about buying more shares. Lugubrious Seven. Don't, not Lag Seven. Let's be smart about this Lugubrious."", 'Matt Argersinger: Someone is right in that.', ""Dylan Lewis: Studying the dictionary over the holiday break, I'm going to look that one afterwards."", ""Matt Argersinger: I've got a daughter that was taking the SAT test recently."", ""Dylan Lewis: [laughs] It is that special time of the year when the wrapping paper and the wreckage of the holidays is out of the house. The new toys all have their batteries and we've got some numbers to make sense of the past holiday shopping season. In addition to shopping, it seems like Jason's been doing a little bit of reading, but I'm going to ask him to check in on the retail picture for the holiday season. As you look back on what we've seen in some of the data we got out there, Jason. What do you think the headline is?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, we saw a headline this week. Adobe Analytics called out online spending for this holiday season, it was up 5% to just over $222 billion for the month of November and December. So modest growth there I feel like my holiday spending was a little bit more than 5% maybe I'm adding a little bit to that. The big theme though, across the board though, it wasn't really more spending on more things, it was lower prices. We saw discounts really come into play this holiday season. I think 31%, we saw a peak discount, 31% off a listed price in electronics versus 25% from a year ago, 24% for apparel, versus 19% from a year ago. Ultimately, we saw shoppers really focusing on those discounts. They bought more things, but they weren't necessarily paying more for them. I think one of the concerns that stands out and we're talking a little bit about this in production was just in regard to how people are spending. We know the consumer is stretched. Buy now, pay later. This is something that's going to be a tool that consumers use going forward. If it's something that helps sellers sell and it helps consumers buy, then, it's going to stick around, I think. But it really needs to find its place in our financial landscape here because as we see buy now, pay later take a bigger role in how people are spending their money and it's a bigger role. It was $16.6 billion in online spending year over the holiday season, up 14% from a year ago. We need to really make sure this is something that the credit ratings agencies see, that merchants see, so that we understand really where the consumers stand because I think the problem, what we're seeing right now, is that consumers are using buy now, pay later in addition to credit cards. Tapping out those credit cards and then going to buy now pay later, which just puts you more in debt and that can be a scary thing."", ""Dylan Lewis: In addition to the update from Adobe Analytics, we also saw some data from Mastercard showing US retail sales up 3%. E-commerce doing the heavy lifting there, but brick and mortar also playing a role at 2.2% growth year over year. Matt, are you like Jason, are you contributing to the growth that we're seeing?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I contribute plenty of growth this season for sure and I'm glad you mentioned the brick and mortar because I think that was an area that a lot of people have given up for dead, but lots of customer traffic. I know some of the malls lined with two were just packed and so people were definitely getting out there and spending."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break. If you're thinking about canceling Netflix or Max, you're not alone. Is that a problem for streamers? Stay right here, you're listening to Motley Fool Money."", 'Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I\'m Dylan Lewis, joined over the airwaves by Fool analysts Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger. If you\'re looking at your credit card statements and saying, ""Do I really need to be subscribed four different streaming services?"" You are in growing company. Jason, to borrow a phrase from former Grubhub CEO Matt Maloney. Streaming customers are becoming more and more promiscuous and willing to jump and join other services and cancel. We\'re seeing more rotation.', ""Jason Moser: That words such an attention getter. Promiscuous. It's like nope, we're talking about streaming. Listen, I personally, it feels like to me, we've hit the ceiling. This is unsustainable at this point. Consolidation is going to have to happen in order for some of these streamers to be able to stay in business. I mean, at the beginning of the year, I like going through and doing a little bit of a checking account audit, credit card statement audit to see exactly what we're all subscribed to. Because it really does add up. It does seem like we're headed for a world with a big four. Something like a Netflix, some Hulu combo, maybe Amazon, and then Max. Then you've got all of other niche players in there that are figuring out ways to be part of bigger packages. I mean, you got Horizon out there talking about offering a suite of Netflix and Warner Bros. Discoveries, HBO Max. Then you've got possibility of Apple saddling up with Paramount Plus, I mean to me this is all stuff that's going to continue. It does, it feels like we're going back to the bundle. I mean, in simple terms, we're going back to some bundle because honestly, that's where you see the most value. I look at this just from our perspective and in our household, we have Hulu Live."", ""But with that, of course, we get the ESPN+ and all that, the Disney+. All of that together. Yeah, it's a little bit of a more expensive bill than just your simple streaming service, but we're getting so much. It's like cable like almost. I suspect we're going to continue to see this, but I think this also really speaks to the value of having the ad-supported option as well. That's why we're seeing Netflix introduced. We saw Amazon just rolling this out. Clearly, it's part of Hulu's model all along. But that really, I think, enables these companies to keep, or at least potentially keep more subscribers without them necessarily defecting completely. Instead of cutting your subscription, maybe you just downgrade it to an ad supported model until you decide to reupgrade. Then you're seeing Netflix as an example there. Where they're trying to figure out ways to monetize gaming. Gaming being part of not only the engagement in keeping people in the universe, but also new sources of monetization. It's a really interesting space. I think 2024 is where we're going to see a real shake out here. A lot of consolidation. Not going to surprise me at all."", ""Dylan Lewis: In addition to the new year kicking off, we have earning season kicking off as the calendar page turns. Some of the earlier reporters got the party started this week and Matt, we saw a bit of a shock from Walgreens. Not so much in the earnings headline numbers but in the company's plans for its cash."", ""Matt Argersinger: Not so much a party over there at Walgreens lately. But yeah, they slashed their dividend from 0.48-0.25 It's the first dividend cut, by the way, in 45 years for Walgreens. It is or I should say it was a Dividend Aristocrat®, meaning it was a member of this really elite group of S&P 500 companies that have raised their dividend for 25 consecutive years as defined by S&P Global. This was a monumental move because, Walgreens CEO can say, we're doing this because we want to turn around the business. We want to show up the balance sheet, we want to reinvest and the dividend, it's costing about 800 million annual cash flow. We can save that money, it'll enable us to pay down debt, etc. But history is not on Walgreens side here. Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds did a really neat long-term study of the S&P 500 covering 50 years from 1973 to the end of 2022. The average stock in the S&P 500 returned 7.7% annually. The average dividend paying company returned 9.2% annually. The average company that cut its dividend returned a -0.6% annually. That's over 50 years. You can believe Walgreens is making the right business decision. But historically, if you look at most companies, a dividend cut is almost always a signal, a poor performance ahead. Here's a bad comp for Walgreens, VF Corp, bigger apparel brand owner. They had raised their dividend 50 consecutive years going into last year. They finally cut their dividend about a year ago. The stock is down some 70% since the cut. If I'm a Walgreen shareholder, I might think they're making the right business decision. It might not be the best long-term decision for the stock. It could be a really bad signal."", ""Dylan Lewis: Anytime we see any adjustments to those dividend policies, we know how sacred those dividends can be and just how important they are to investors. It's not a decision that management teams take lightly. We are going to see more earnings reports pick up over the course of the month. I want to get a little preview. Jason, as we see more businesses report over the coming weeks, what are you paying attention to? Is there any business in particular that you're watching?"", ""Jason Moser: I'm actually looking forward to Cloudflare's report here. I think that'll come out later in February. But you go back to just April of 2023. They reported the first quarter earnings where the stock just got pummeled. It was sub $40 per share. That was based essentially on, what we then heard for the rest of the year was all of these enterprise customers, pinching the purse strings, really watching that spending. Cloudflare, which has always been valued at a premium, still working its way toward sustainable profitability. But I mean, they guided down just slightly. They guided down somewhere in the neighborhood of 4% on the top line. At that point, they said they still were going to grow that top line, 31.5% and the market still just punished the stock. But you fast forward to today and clearly there's been a strong recovery in the business. If you look at just the most recent quarters results, I mean the key performance indicators remain impressive, large customers are growing and spending more money. They're still guiding for what they expect to see 32% top line growth for the full year. Around 28-29% for this quarter that they're getting ready to report. That's going to be a company I'm keeping my eye on."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, what about you? What's the name that you're watching this earnings season?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I'm looking at Vail Resorts here. Now they don't report until early March. They're one of those off cycle reporters. But this is a critical quarter for Vail because it encompasses the results through January. That first big month of the ski season, and Vail had a really tough 2022, 2023 ski season. They had tough weather conditions in the West, they had very little snow in the East. They've taken on a lot of debt recently. They've made a lot of big acquisitions and some big capital investments in the resorts. This has to be a really good ski season I think to support continued investment, keep the dividend growing. I'm a shareholder, so both of those things are important to me. But also I think Vail Resorts will tell us a little bit about the state consumer spending, particularly at the high end. If there's weakness in their resort revenues, in their ancillary businesses, in the traffic they're seeing to their mountains, into their resorts, into their restaurants, that might be a signal that we're finally seeing a consumer pull back a little bit. I think that could signal that we might be headed to a bit of an economic downturn. Especially if a lot of those buy now pay later, people are going to those resorts. They booked all these vacations on there. I'm a little worried about that after some of the things Jason said."", ""Dylan Lewis: Well, Matt, I can personally speak to the conditions on the ground on the East Coast Resorts. I spent new years in the Poconos and went to Blue Mountain and all that was on the ground was blown snow. There was not a lake of snow, just just a thin vein of snow going down the mountain as you rolled up from a distance. I don't know if that picture is going to change anytime soon, but I awfully hope it does."", ""Matt Argersinger: I sure hope it does too, cause I'm flying out to Utah at the end of the month, so to do some skiing out near Park City. Hoping for snow, we'll put the call out there for listeners as well. We will appreciate the snow reports and the resort reports."", ""Dylan Lewis: If you're out there, podcast@fool.com is where you can send them. Jason, Matt, we're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next, Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner explains why the future is so bright. You got to wear shades. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. We're back in the studio for the first time in 2024, and the New Year means a renewed interest in all topics, money and investing. This week I caught up with Motley Fool co-founder, chief rule breaker, and host of the Rule Breaker Investing podcast, David Gardner. David walked me through some timeless investing advice and give an optimistic look forward to kick off the New Year. David, thanks so much for joining me."", 'David Gardner: Happy New Year, Dylan. Happy New Year, everyone.', ""Dylan Lewis: It's great to kick off 2024, and it's great to do it with you here on the show. Every time the calendar page turns over into January, I know a lot of people, especially a lot of our listeners, check in on their finances, and they start to make some goals about their investing life and what they want to be doing with money over the year. You've been speaking to investors new and old for such a long time. I wanted to start out with you and some advice for two different groups. First off, some of the folks that are coming into investing and are maybe new to investing, maybe what your advice would be for them."", ""David Gardner: It's longer term than you think. I truly believe that many people who come new to investing think that it's trading when it's not. It's investing, and there's a really important difference. Trading is shorter term. It's practiced often by people down on floors like futures traders, bond traders, professional people. There are also people who buy their big PC with their trading station and day trade watching CNBC. Most of our Foolish listeners, new and old, won't be like that. But just to understand, that's such the temper of the times. That's how people often think. They watch CNBC, and it's a minute to minute thing, and so they start with such a short term mentality. If you're an investor with us, capital F, a Foolish investor, you're thinking about it for the rest of your life you should be invested all the way through adding, adding, adding, rarely selling. Unless you don't believe in that thing anymore, and you can change out that money to something else, so I would say to the new investors, understand the proper mentality, the right mindset for what is investing. A beautiful word, the antithesis of trading."", 'Dylan Lewis: David, what about people that have been investing for a while and maybe have been investing the Foolish way where they are long term buyers and owners of businesses?', ""David Gardner: Yeah, keep it up because you know what? There are a lot of countervailing forces that try to stop you from keeping it up. Huge market gyrations, we've seen that over the last few years. A huge up, a huge down, and a pretty great year back up last year. I'm not all the way back Dylan to my 2021 highs. I don't know about you, friend, but a lot of us are probably not. If you've been with Motley Fool for a while, you're probably not back to your all time highs yet, but you shouldn't be that far. I understand some of us started with The Fool three years ago when the market was about to tank. Others started three decades ago. We've seen this time and time again and all that really matters is not what happened last year, 2023 or 10 years ago, but what happens next? For me, what happens next is usually good. I think the market's going up this year, two years in three it does. So just understand what you tell yourself in your head during bad times often is the hardest thing you need to overcome as a Foolish investor. I would also just add as maybe an appendix to that. Dylan, take a look over the stocks in your portfolio. Are these all companies that you esteem? Would you be proud if that company takes over the world in the next 10 years? Is it a better world? It's so important to me as a conscious capitalist that each of us realizes the money that is in our portfolios is really shaping the future, truly in its own small way, in aggregate, in a huge way. I would say make your portfolio reflect your best vision for our future and from time to time, we need to just review and see if that's still true."", ""Dylan Lewis: David, it's as if you had my portfolio statement in front of you. I am off of all time highs, but still well above where I was before the pandemic. A big part of that is the success of companies that I have owned for quite some time and have enjoyed owning, will continue to own. One of those businesses, for me, is Axon. It's been an incredible performer and certainly a business that I want to own as I see the future unfold because I think it can play a very large and critical part in it. It's also a business I have learned so much from by following and just understanding where the world has gone. When I look at Axon, for example, I see the migration to Cloud being such a large part of that story. That's huge and a really critical part of The Fool ethos, learning from businesses that we invest in. I'm curious as we look out, are there any names in your mind, maybe from the past year or from recent memory, that you feel like you've learned a lot from?"", ""David Gardner: Well, first of all, I think every stock tells a story. If you stuck with that stock, you lengthened the story, and it became a more important, deeper story that you learn more from. If you're just jumping in, jumping out, you're not going to learn too much. But we certainly love stories at The Motley Fool, and you're a wonderful storyteller, Dylan. You talk to other people who tell stories, and that's what I'm about to do is tell a story. The one I wanted to talk about here is Nvidia, because Nvidia has ended up becoming the greatest stock pick in Motley Fool Stock Advisor history as of now. It's good to look at our exemplars. It's good to look at excellence and what really wins, and understand and learn from that. So can I just tell a little bit of the story of Nvidia?"", 'Dylan Lewis: Of course.', ""David Gardner: Let's do it. Settle down here by the campfire. I hope friends and family maybe outsider, and let's talk briefly this weekend about Nvidia, which I first picked on. It was Tax Day, April 15th, 2005. The stock was at $1.64. These are all split adjusted prices. It's a very successful graphics card company so they're making, if you like, computer games than I do. They're making cards that give you better graphics, graphic processing units, what Nvidia was bringing. That's what attracted me to them at the time. By October 2007, so two years later it's gone from a buck 64 to 10. So a six bagger feeling great. Now those of us who remember market history know 2007, things are probably peaking somewhere right around now. But six bagger two years later, for all our Stock Advisor members, couldn't be more excited about Nvidia. By the end of 2008, it had dropped from 10 to below $1.50, so there we are with our six bagger. Three years later, we're now under water on the pick, but we stick with it. By the end of 2014, it's back to five, so half where it was seven years earlier, but still a three bagger nine years after we picked it. So it's back to five 2016 two years later, big moment, it crosses 10. Ten where it had been. In October 2007 we're back. By the end of that year, it has tripled from 7.5-22.5 2016. It is the top performing stock on the S&P 500, so our cost basis is $1.64, and we're back to 22.5 we've held over a decade through. Just crazy times. I'm going to give myself a little bit props at this point. Because as I thought about what stock do I want to rerecommend at the start of 2017, there was a lot of reporting about how Nvidia had been the top performer on the S&P 500 the previous year. Most people get afraid then. They think, well, revert to the mean, what goes up must come down. But trying to be the Foolish rule breaker that I am, I made that my new pick to start 2017. So yes, 12 years later, I'm picking it again to buy with fresh money and just a month after it closed out, the best year for the S&P 500 of any other of the 499 stocks. So 2017 rerec. It goes from 22.5 that year to 52.5. It turns out you can be the top performer and a year later you can more than double again, so 2018, it's gone from 52.5-70. I hope this isn't boring, but we're almost on this shaggy dog story. But in 2018, having just hit 70, it goes 70-30. Wham-o, I think some of us will remember."", ""Crypto was like a big thing for Nvidia, also the idea like AI, and AI and cars and other things like that. Some of that slowed down and some of the crypto hype was subsiding. That really hurt Nvidia stock. It gets cut in half that year, but by early 2020 it crosses 70 again and by the end of 2020 it's at $130 a share. Remember, our cost basis is $1.64. Really nice then when in 2021 it goes from 130 to over $300 a share. As we hit the penultimate chapter of this long story of association 18 years and counting with Nvidia, we learned that in 2022, the stock ends up dropping from just over 300 to just over 100. You had a near trillion dollar company, Dylan and fellow Fools everywhere that lost two thirds of its value in a single year, 2022. Not so long ago, but today we're back over 200. Back over 300. Back over 400. It recently touched 500, though it's around 475 or so as we close out this week. It's been a 295 bagger for Motley Fool Stock Advisor members of Vintage 2005 who are, I hope you are still holding. All you had to do was just hold for 18.5 years now and counting. I think there's so much to have learned from that story. Many people don't have long associations with stocks, but when you can, A, invest for the long term, the only term that counts, and B, find great companies. You just learned so much. Your eyes are opened to what investing truly is. But you have to let it take time. I would suggest the rest of your life."", 'Dylan Lewis: I love that story, David, because I think so many lessons there, and also because there are probably a lot of people that first started following Nvidia this past year as it entered the Magnificent Seven and became this massive, unavoidable success story. I love that. It has been a long march for this company and the people that have followed it and held it for that entire time have been incredibly well rewarded for doing so.', ""David Gardner: It's not the only one I could tell similar stories around stocks that we've recommended in Stock Advisor. Netflix, which was when I retired from stock picking in May of 2021, that was the big performer. That was the 200 plus bagger. Of course, having picked Amazon a long time ago back in our AOL day is still holding. That's really been the best stock pick of my life. But these are all great stories. What you choose to learn from the stories, you take away, another great stock we've picked Apple. How many people had Apple at some point, but maybe their money doubled and so they sold out. Or maybe it had a bad quarter and they thought, people are saying Apple's too high right now, whatever it is, you end up not learning and not prospering from some of the best instincts that you had. Returning to what I said a few minutes ago, Dylan, if we are making our portfolio reflect our best vision for our future and you just stay focused there, I bet your vision for the future isn't changing as often as stock prices do. I bet your best vision for our future is not changing as frequently as the pundits do, changing their minds on this so called Magnificent Seven, a phrase I don't really use too often because it's the Johnny come lately FAANG stock like group, a bunch of companies, many of which we've held for years and years, that just did really well and create a cute label for them. I'm not trying to demean it, but I'm just like, it's so short term and it's missing the bigger picture."", ""Dylan Lewis: I hope I didn't offend you there, David."", ""David Gardner: Not at all. No. Believe me, I have a long list of pet peeves. I do them on my podcast once a year or so. I'll air out eight or ten more. That is a pet peeve that predates you, Dylan, and it's really as much about the FAANG stocks. Do you remember that phrase?"", 'Dylan Lewis: Of course.', ""David Gardner: I've been using that a lot of these are the same companies just in different clothes like Magnificent Seven. Most of those are the same stocks that were there. But when Jim Kramer especially was playing up FAANG stocks, my big point was well, it's great to have them or be aware of these companies, the Magnificent Seven, or seven of the great companies in the world today. I'm not going to demean that, but the real question that I would have is for anybody who's talking about Magnificent Seven, what is your Magnificent Seven score? Your Magnificent Seven score is, you add up the number of years that you've held each of those stocks in the Magnificent Seven, and that is much more important than that you had them at the end of this year window dressing your professional mutual fund portfolio, or telling your friends over eggnog that you own some Nvidia. To me it's about the years, and that's the point that will rarely be made in popular media, and that is the point that matters more than anything else."", ""Dylan Lewis: You mentioned your pet peeve series there with RBI. You have many series and many recurring volumes with RBI. One of my favorites is your quote series. You have your great quote volumes and I'm curious. We always look for wisdom, we always look for inspiration as we head into the New Year. Are there any quotes that are really ringing in your head right now?"", 'David Gardner: I love great quotes and obviously having now done 17 episodes with a new group five quotes every time, I guess I\'m up to nearly 100 great quotes. I am somebody, it sounds like you are too Dylan and I\'m somebody who loves finding the most used. It\'s across different cultures, across different time periods. But finding those things and sticking with them and in good times and bad is really helpful for all of us as investors, business people, and fellow livers of life. Let me close with one that somebody I know and esteem, but it didn\'t know, he said it. But it\'s Frank Lloyd Wright, the American architect. I love this line. ""The longer I live, the more beautiful life becomes."" I hope that\'s true for you. Whoever\'s listening right now, I hope that\'s true. We have the ups and downs. Every day is not beautiful, every market year is not beautiful. But I hope the longer you hold Nvidia, the longer you do the thing that you do, whatever it is, the thing that you do, the people that you love, the longer that you\'re here with us, I hope the more beautiful life becomes. It did for Frank Lloyd Wright, apparently, and I would say it did for me and I\'m looking forward to several more decades on this planet.', ""Dylan Lewis: After we wrapped up taping, David asked me, what's the cutoff for wishing someone a happy new year? I said, January 12th, listeners, we want to know what you think. You can send your New Year's greeting cutoff date to podcast at fool.com, and of course, you can always send questions for our analysts and ideas for the show there too as well. Coming up after the break, Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser return the couple stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. Don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis joined again by Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser. We've got radar stocks in a minute but first gentlemen, it appears there is a limit to pricing power. European grocer Carrefour is dropping Pepsi products from stores after the company's run of price increases. Tough news if you're trying to get Doritos in Belgium, but may be understandable given the increases we've seen. Jason, what is a snack with unlimited pricing power in the Moser household?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, my wife will tell you, I have the tooth of salt, not of sweet, so I can spend irrationally on some Dot's Pretzels, all flavors I do not discriminate, and a staple that I'm always on board with is extra toasty cheeses."", ""Dylan Lewis: I love Dot's Pretzels. That was a new snack for me in 2023, and one that is a staple of my pantry. Now, Matt, what about you? What has pricing power?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I'm a big fan of SunChips. I think they're a Pepsi product, especially the garden salsa flavor. I think if my grocery store didn't sell them anymore, I'd be sad. But generally, I'm a big fan of just roasted salted cashews or almonds, or really any nuts, I can't get enough. Unfortunately, bags of those run like $10 these days. But I can't help myself."", ""Dylan Lewis: We got some salty palates here. Let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our men behind the glass, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question. Jason, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?"", ""Jason Moser: Digging a little bit more into a company called UiPath, Ticker is PATH. They build and manage automation and computer vision technology. They do this through their business automation platform that ultimately spans the full automation spectrum. Examples of what this can be used for, think of healthcare, where they can actually help automate EMR, electronic medical record work flows, claim systems, document management, and data transfer. They make money from the sale of their software licenses in their SaaS business subscriptions. They integrate with offerings from companies like Adobe, Atlassian, CrowdStrike, Salesforce, and more. So this really does expand the audience and the use cases for the company, The co-founders and also co CEOs, you've got Daniel Dines and Rob Insulin, they're still leading the way. Dines, interestingly owns more than 19% of the company still. It's a very interesting business playing into a lot of the tail ones we talk about with AI and in automation and machine learning and whatnot. Still working its way to profitability though and valuation today is still a big risk."", ""Dylan Lewis: We'd go on the entire show without talking AI and here Jason brings it up toward the end. Dan, a question about UiPath?"", 'Dan Boyd: Not going to lie. When I saw the name of this company, I thought they would be like some sort of med tech stock that did stuff with urinary tract infections. Terrible name for a company regardless of what they do.', 'Dylan Lewis: Mostly a comment it seems. Kicking us off strong. Matt, what is on your radar this week?', ""Matt Argersinger: Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, ticker PEB, can always count on me to find these small obscure REITs that nobody cares about. But I think more investors should care about Pebblebrook. This is a REIT that really suffered obviously in the aftermath of COVID 19, business for their hotels and resorts basically shut down for several months and it was very slow to bounce back. But here we are today. Hotel occupancy revenues are almost back to pre pandemic levels. The company has sold off some of its non-core assets, paid down a lot of debt, no major debt maturities now until October 2025, and management has been buying back a lot of stock. That's rare for a REIT, in fact, the CEO himself has personally acquired over 300,000 shares since 2020 and I expect a big dividend raise this year. Feels like a hidden gem to me in Reitland."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Pebblebrook Hotel Trust.', ""Dan Boyd: Matt, you said this stock has suffered since the pandemic, but looking at their stock price, it seems like they've been suffering since about 2015. Any thoughts on that? [laughs]"", ""Matt Argersinger: That's a good call, Dan. I think they extended themselves beyond their kind of core boutique resort asset in those years, and so I think they've done a good job of kind of selling a lot of this off, getting to a debt lower. I expect better years ahead."", ""Dylan Lewis: Dan, which one's on your list?"", ""Dan Boyd: Bad name, good company, UiPath, let's go."", ""Dylan Lewis: Love it.

GLP-1 may not be the most significant healthcare breakthrough of all time, but it certainly represents one of its most profitable in a while. Further, I believe GLP-1 drugs shined a bright light on the rest of the healthcare industry and its ability to innovate to the degree of an AI firm. Highly-rated healthcare stocks — like BIIB, ZTS, and EXAS — look nothing short of compelling for the year.', 'Indeed, disruptive biotech companies may have just as much growth potential as tech firms with skin in the AI game. Which biotech theme comes after GLP-1 drugs remains to be seen. Regardless, I think the space is worth watching if you’ve got an appetite for growth but are off-put by valuations on the top AI stocks.', 'Therefore, in this piece, we’ll discover three Strong-Buy-rated health and biotech firms that are innovating in their own right.', 'Biogen stock has been fluctuating wildly in both directions over the past decade, ultimately finishing 15% lower. Undoubtedly, it’s easy to just throw in the towel on the biotech firm that’s failed to deliver for its investors. Though Biogen doesn’t have its own ready-to-use GLP-1 drug, it’s an expert in the field of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s.', 'According to a recent Reuters report, weight-loss drugs may see a new growth frontier in Alzheimer’s, as researchers are studying how these drugs can treat the disease. Though it’s too early to conclude that Biogen’s hopping aboard the GLP-1 bandwagon, I think it’s a cheap stock with a robust pipeline of potential game-changers.', 'One potential game-changer may lie in Alzheimer’s treatment Leqembi, which recently won approval in China. The move is quite promising and has me staying bullish on the stock despite its lack of long-term momentum.', 'For a stock that’s gone nowhere in a decade, Biogen is a name that only patient, long-term value investors should seek out. Though untimely, Biogen stock was recently named a top biotech pick for 2024 by Baird. For this year, lower rates and a pick-up in M&A activity in the space could prove to be nice tailwinds for Biogen and the biotech scene as a whole.', 'Biogen stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 21 Buys and six Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average BIIB stock price target\xa0of $309.64 implies 24.8% upside potential.', 'Could GLP-1 drugs for pets be next? Probably (actually, most definitely) not, but that doesn’t mean animal health firm Zoetis is a healthcare stock to scratch off your radar. The stock is in the middle of a remarkable comeback since bottoming out in October 2022. Still off around 20% from its highs, though, I view ZTS as a niche player with a wide moat and plenty of underrated innovations. For these reasons, I remain bullish alongside most analysts.', 'The company has posted a net income compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.4% over the past five years. That’s impressive growth that probably won’t be curtailed anytime soon, not as the firm looks to reap the rewards of its Librela treatment for dogs suffering from osteoarthritis. It’s not only the first treatment of its kind for dogs, but it’s the only one on the market right now. That’s the beauty of being one of the very few players in the niche field of animal health.', 'Looking ahead, I’d look for the U.S. commercialization of Librela to pick up meaningful traction and propel shares toward new highs.', 'Zoetis stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with seven unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average ZTS stock price target\xa0of $224 implies 12.6% upside potential.', 'Exact Sciences stock has been a tough stock to own over the past five years, with shares swinging viciously in both directions. Over the past five years, shares of the diagnostics company behind such screening products as Cologuard (used to detect colorectal cancer in stool samples) are down 13%.', 'Cologuard leverages some impressive science to make its incredibly convenient and life-saving screener possible. Recently, Exact Sciences filed a lawsuit regarding alleged patent infringement revolving around one of its competitor’s colorectal screeners. It will be interesting to see how this one pans out. In any case, I’m staying bullish on EXAS stock.', 'In the meantime, I continue to applaud Cologuard’s growth potential (screening revenue grew 31% in the latest quarter) as more people become aware of just how easy it is to get tested for something as horrid as colorectal cancer. It’s also impressive that the firm is sticking with its guide of hitting $4 billion in sales by 2027. Given the nature of its business, I don’t expect any sort of economic downturn to prevent Exact from hitting its long-term targets.', 'Exact Sciences stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 15 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average EXAS stock price target\xa0of $91.21 implies 35.9% upside potential.', 'As more biotech and healthcare firms aim for a more preventative approach to medicine, I think it’s just a matter of time before firms invest greater sums into the high-growth areas of healthcare, such as GLP-1 drugs and cancer screeners. Add lower interest rates and AI-aided drug discovery into the equation, and it’s hard to ignore the biotech firms in this environment any longer.', 'The following three stocks have disruptive potential and innovative pipelines that could power market share growth over the long haul. Of the three names, analysts see the most upside potential from EXAS stock (35.9%) for the year ahead.', 'Disclosure']"

Not only did it elect to keep interest rates steady, but it also indicated cuts to the all-important federal funds rate. The median estimate calls for three rate cuts by the end of 2024.', ""The federal funds rate is the rate at which banks lend each other money, and it's the biggest determinant of rates for just about every type of loan from a government bond to a home mortgage. The Federal Reserve is in charge of setting that rate, and by extension the cost to borrow for everyone from the government to consumers to businesses."", 'While the Fed forecasts just three interest rate cuts, Wall Street is more optimistic. The average futures trader expects six rate cuts by the end of the year, bringing the top end of the Fed funds target rate from 5.5% to just 4%.', 'Many businesses have been hit hard by high interest rates. But a few could see tremendous relief from lower costs to borrow that could fuel their earnings and, by extension, their stock prices much higher. Here are three stocks to buy today, before the Fed cuts interest rates.', 'Real estate investment trusts (REITs) were hit particularly hard by rising interest rates.', 'A couple of factors punished shares of REITs. First, and most obvious, higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing, which is essential for most REITs. A higher interest expense on the books means lower funds from operation, which means less cash to pass on to shareholders.', 'But the bigger impact of the increased interest rates is that investors now discount the future cash flows of a REIT at a much higher rate.', ""The REITs most affected by changes in interest rates are those with steady cash flow from long-term leases. Realty Income (NYSE: O) is the poster child for steadily growing free cash flow with its portfolio of retail storefronts concentrated in defensive sectors. As a triple-net lease operator, it's not responsible for rising taxes, insurance, or maintenance on its properties (the tenants are), which makes it far less risky than other REITs. But with such predictable free cash flow, it was also easiest to discount amid rising interest rates."", ""While shares of Realty Income already got a boost after the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting in December indicated forthcoming rate cuts, it could still move higher based on Wall Street's expectations for even more rate cuts than indicated by the Fed. Shares still trade for less than 15 times management's expectations for 2023 adjusted funds from operations. That's a better-than-fair price to pay for the REIT."", ""If you've been trying to buy a house recently, you're probably familiar with Zillow Group (NASDAQ: Z) (NASDAQ: ZG). The online real estate listing company is the leading destination for home searchers. You'll also probably know there aren't many houses for sale."", ""Management noted new listing volumes are as low as they've ever been since 2010. There's a clear reason for that. Many homeowners have locked in record-low mortgage rates in 2020 and 2021. Meanwhile, new buyers have seen their buying power diminish as a result of higher mortgage rates, further reducing the number of available buyers."", 'Zillow generates its revenue from rental listings, mortgage origination, and home sale listing tools for agents. While the rental market has helped prop up its results in 2023, the challenging environment for new home sales has led to overall revenue declines for Zillow. But as interest rates decline, more homeowners are willing to move, and more people are able to afford new homes, Zillow should see strong growth.', 'Management expects rate cuts to provide a massive boon to its top line. Its long-term forecast in early 2022 called for $5 billion in annual revenue with a 45% earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin by the end of 2025. That would be phenomenal growth considering its 2023 outlook calls for $1.9 billion. Still, even half that growth, fueled by an expanding portfolio of services and a little help from the Federal Reserve, could make the stock a buy. Analysts currently expect just 9.4% sales growth for 2024, so a resurgence in the housing market could enable strong outperformance for Zillow.', ""NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP) got hit hard by the rise in interest rates. The company relied on convertible equity portfolio financing (CEPF) to buy assets from its parent company, NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), as well as from third-party sellers. Those notes are convertible to shares based on the price of NextEra Energy Partners' shares."", ""When interest rates rose, NextEra Energy Partners' financing costs increased too. That put pressure on its stock price as a result, which became a double whammy for the company, as it now has to provide more shares to convert its maturing CEPFs. It was forced to find new funding, and it did so in the sale of some of its assets. It recently agreed to sell its STX Midstream business to Kinder Morgan for $1.8 billion, and it'll use a portion of the proceeds to pay off its debt."", ""Another challenge of the increased interest rates was that NextEra Energy Partners is now unable to acquire as many assets to fuel its growth. It's instead focusing on organic growth, such as repowering existing wind farms. However, that will result in significantly slower growth than it was experiencing before the shift in strategy. As a result, management cut its dividend growth outlook in half, which sent the share price down further (putting further pressure on management to extinguish the CEPFs)."", ""However, a turnaround in interest rates could alleviate a lot of the pressure on NextEra Energy Partners. With $1.35 billion in debt maturing this year and an additional $700 million coming due next year, lower interest rates will enable it to refinance without as big a hit to its interest expense. With the shares yielding 11.4% on its dividend with management's target to keep growing the dividend at a 6% rate, it's worth buying shares of the high-yield MLP."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

Powering their popularity is their focus on the future of energy. Many investors believe these stocks can produce high-powered returns as they rev up their growth engines in the coming years.', ""I'm more skeptical about their ability to deliver returns for investors. Because of that, I won't be buying their shares this year. However, I'm still investing in the future of energy. I plan to buy more shares of several future-focused energy stocks in 2024, including NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE)."", ""Plug Power is an emerging leader in hydrogen. The company has grand growth ambitions. It expects to grow its revenue from $1.2 billion last year to $6 billion by 2027 and reach $20 billion by 2030. That's a staggering 50% compound annual growth rate. That scorching growth rate could enable Plug to produce powerful returns for investors. "", 'However, there\'s one problem with Plug\'s plans. It\'s running dangerously low on fuel. Due to deteriorating market conditions and other issues, the company\'s liquidity is drying up. Plug unveiled last November that it might not be able to continue as a going concern. The company is ""projecting that its existing cash and available for sale and equity securities will not be sufficient to fund its operations through the next twelve months."" ', ""Plug needs to plug into additional capital sources to fund its operations and growth. That could be highly dilutive to existing investors. Because of that, Plug's stock might not deliver returns for investors even if it achieves its bold growth plans. That has certainly been the case throughout its history. Plug has lost a staggering 96% of its value since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1999. "", ""QuantumScape is developing a next-generation battery-storage solution. The company's solid-state batteries could be a game-changer for the electric vehicle sector by providing better battery life and other advantages over traditional lithium-ion batteries. Early tests by partner VW Group have confirmed that the battery has far exceeded the lifespan of a typical lithium-ion battery. "", ""My concern with QuantumScape is that it's still in the early stages of commercializing its products. Because of that, it has a long road ahead before reaching profitability. The company will need to build and scale its manufacturing capacity, which will take time and money."", ""I'm worried that capital could become a problem for QuantumScape in the future, much like it has become for Plug Power. It's not a concern at the moment because the company raised another $300 million in cash by selling additional shares last August, boosting its liquidity to $1.1 billion. Given its current cash-burn rate, that gives it enough money to operate until at least 2026. However, it's unclear when the company will reach the point of sustainable profit growth, which is the key driver of stock-price appreciation over the long term. Shares have already lost more than 60% of their initial value and could remain under pressure until the company can turn the corner on profitability. "", ""NextEra Energy offers something Plug Power and QuantumScape lack. It's a proven value creator in the clean energy sector. The leading renewable energy producer has generated a more-than 14% annualized total return over the past decade. That has outpaced the over 12% annual total return by the S&P 500. "", 'Profitable growth is the key to its success in creating shareholder value. The utility has grown its adjusted earnings per share at a nearly 10% compound annual rate over the past decade. Steadily rising profits have given it the funds to invest more money into expanding its clean energy businesses while returning more cash to shareholders. NextEra Energy has grown its dividend at an 11% compound annual rate over the last 10 years. ', ""The company has plenty of power to continue growing its earnings at an attractive rate. It expects to deliver earnings growth toward the upper end of its 6% to 8% annual target range through 2026. Powering that growth is its continued investments in high-return renewable energy and energy storage projects. The company sees plenty more growth ahead as it capitalizes on the potentially massive hydrogen market, which could be a $4 trillion investment opportunity in the U.S. alone by 2050. NextEra Energy's future investments in renewables, battery storage, and hydrogen could give it the power to continue producing market-beating total returns. "", ""Plug Power and QuantumScape hold lots of promise. They could deliver powerful returns in the years ahead as they build out their manufacturing capacity and grow their revenue -- if they don't run out of cash, which is a huge risk."", ""NextEra Energy, on the other hand, is a much safer bet. The company generates more than enough cash to fund its growth, giving it excess to return to shareholders through a growing dividend. That's why I'd buy more shares this year while continuing to steer clear of the riskier Plug Power and QuantumScape."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Plug Power right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Plug Power, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Plug Power wasn't one of them.

While that wasn't a bad performance, it significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (which gained 24.2% in 2023). On a more positive note, Kinder Morgan's total return was a positive 4.1% in 2023 after adding its high-yielding dividend."", ""Higher interest rates, lower oil prices, and other factors weighed on the natural gas pipeline stock last year. Here's a quick look back at 2023 and what investors can expect in the coming year. "", 'Kinder Morgan expected rising interest rates to be a headwind last year. The pipeline giant provided its 2023 financial guidance in December 2022. At the time, the company anticipated that its distributable cash flow (DCF) would decline from $2.17 per share to $2.13 per share. The culprit was the expectation that higher interest rates would lop $0.15 per share from its DCF last year. ', 'Unfortunately, that wasn\'t the only headwind it faced last year. While Kinder Morgan hasn\'t reported its full-year results yet, it warned in its third-quarter earnings report, ""We expect to finish 2023 slightly below our plan on a full-year basis."" The culprits were ""lower than expected commodity prices, delayed RNG projects and higher pipeline integrity expense."" ', ""On a positive note, the company capitalized on last year's challenging market conditions to make a needle-moving deal. Higher interest rates forced energy infrastructure operator NextEra Energy Partners to shift its strategy, which included putting its natural gas pipeline assets up for sale. Kinder Morgan was able to capitalize on the situation by acquiring STX Midstream from NextEra Energy Partners for around $1.8 billion. That's about 8.6 times STX Midstream's estimated 2024 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Kinder Morgan expects the acquisition multiple to drop to around 7 to 7.5 times over the long term as it integrates the highly complementary pipeline portfolio. "", ""Meanwhile, Kinder Morgan expects 2024 to be a much better year. The company anticipates its DCF will rise by about 5% this year, fueled by rate escalations and recently completed expansion projects. That forecast doesn't include the benefit from the accretive STX Midstream deal, which should enhance its growth rate this year. Kinder Morgan's growing earnings will enable it to increase its dividend again this year (it aims to boost the payout by about 2%, marking its seventh straight year of dividend growth). "", 'While 2023 was a down year for Kinder Morgan, this year could be much better. Its headwinds should fade, which should enable the company to start increasing its cash flow again (with an additional boost from STX Midstream). With its earnings growing by more than 5% and its dividend yielding over 6%, the company should have the fuel to deliver a double-digit total return in 2024.

Assuming Congress approves the sale, RTX Corporation (NYSE: RTX) -- as Raytheon was recently renamed -- stands to reap hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from this sale.', ""RTX hasn't built new Stingers for 20 years. But as Defense One reported in June, after the Ukraine war started, the Pentagon asked it to restart production, ordering 1,700 modernized missiles to be produced by 2026."", 'The new missiles will be upgraded FIM-92 ""K"" variant Stingers -- nine generations removed from the missiles used in the Soviet-Afghan war. Equipped with new proximity fuzes, the new Stingers will be able to engage 21st Century threats that didn\'t exist 40 years ago -- specifically, small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are too small to ""hit.""', 'They\'ll also be configured for firing from military vehicles, such as Humvees, and receive targeting data from their launchers en route. This is a crucial upgrade when tracking UAVs that put out little or no heat signature and might not be discoverable by ""original recipe"" Stingers, which were heat seekers.', ""Here's where things get interesting (for investors). RTX has historically been the authorized manufacturer of the Stinger missile. But late last year, the U.S. Army awarded contracts to both RTX and its archrival in missile systems, defense contracting giant Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), to develop an improved Stinger missile."", 'In September last year, both RTX and Lockheed were awarded contracts for ""upgrades and replacement"" of the Stinger -- $418.3 million for Raytheon and $312 million for Lockheed Martin ($730.3 million in total). These contracts do not, however, appear to be related (at least not directly) to the sale that DSCA notified Congress about in December, which is worth $780\xa0million in total. What\'s more, Aviation Week confirms that the total number of upgraded Stingers the Pentagon wants to buy could rise to 8,000 -- 8 1/2 times as many as described in the NATO sale.', ""On the one hand, this probably comes as something of a disappointment for investors in RTX. The company isn't winning the Stinger contract all for itself but must split the sale with Lockheed. On the other hand, when viewed in light of the September 2023 contract, it turns out that eventual Stinger revenue could be bigger for both RTX and Lockheed -- as much as 8.5x bigger."", 'Let\'s not count all 8,000 of these ""chickens"" before the eggs have hatched. But even the $1.51 billion in contracts that have already been awarded are pretty significant. Assuming the same rough 57-43 split in contract value seen in the September contracts, $1.51 billion in total contracts should mean at least $865 million in incremental revenue for RTX.', 'Will that be enough to move the needle for this defense stock?', ""Raytheon Missiles & Defense, the RTX unit through which Stinger sales will run, is the company's second smallest business unit, with $14.9 billion in annual sales. However, it's also RTX's second biggest profits contributor, generating $1.5 billion in operating profits, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence."", ""So $865 million in sales at Raytheon Missiles & Defense averaging a 10.2% profit margin should mean about $88 million in incremental profits for RTX, or about $0.06 extra per share -- roughly 3% of an average year's profits for the company. Spread that out over three years from now to 2026, and that could be enough to grow Raytheon's annual earnings growth rate from the 11% it's currently expected to grow to, perhaps, 12%."", ""It's not a huge amount, granted. But I believe it's big enough to move the needle on RTX stock. And if RTX gets an order for 8,000 more missiles, you can expect that needle to move even higher."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in RTX right now?', 'Before you buy stock in RTX, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and RTX wasn't one of them.

Unfortunately for Astrobotic, the Peregrine had to abandon its mission. But as for the Vulcan, that rocket flew just fine."", ""Monday's mission was the first of two launches that ULA will perform to win U.S. Space Force certification to use the rocket on national security missions. ULA plans to launch a second Vulcan in April, sending a Dream Chaser space plane to the International Space Station for Sierra Space."", ""With that accomplished, ULA will launch four more times before the year is through, making for a total of six spaceflights this year. That's twice\xa0as many launches as ULA was able to accomplish in 2023."", 'And the Vulcan will just be getting started. While ULA still has Atlas V rockets in its inventory, and will launch that model 17 more times before retiring it, the Vulcan is clearly the future for ULA.', ""CEO Tory Bruno said a total of 70 Vulcan launches are already on order, including no fewer than 38 launches carrying Kuiper satellites for Amazon's planned satellite internet service. To accommodate the workload, ULA has plans to ramp up Vulcan manufacturing to 25 units per year by the end of 2025."", ""To help meet this goal, the company plans to make the Vulcan partly reusable, detaching the rocket's main engine after launch and parachuting it back to earth, where it will be retrieved by helicopter and reused. If ULA can do this, it should also be able to cut the cost of its launches, with engines making up 65% of the cost of building a rocket."", ""Last month, I wrote about how recent Pentagon contract awards proved ULA's success in fulfilling Bruno's vow to reduce launch costs. A recent packet of 11 Space Force launches was awarded at an average cost of only $118 million per launch. As Reuters reported this week, the company plans to charge even less for some future launches -- as little as $110 million."", ""Of particular note, that same Space Force award saw SpaceX charging $120 million per launch, although some of these will use more-powerful Falcon Heavy rockets. That caveat aside, it actually looks like ULA has fulfilled its promise to build a rocket capable of matching SpaceX's pricing, or at least come really close."", ""But will ULA be able to keep competing on price with SpaceX? Perhaps. Without boosters, ULA's base-model Vulcan can carry 10.8 metric tons of cargo to low earth orbit (LEO). SpaceX's booster-less Falcon 9 rocket, though, can carry more than twice that cargo to LEO for a lower price."", ""A boosted version of the Vulcan is expected to eventually be able to put 27.2 metric tons of cargo into orbit. But even there, SpaceX's ability to deliver 63.5 tons to LEO with the Falcon Heavy puts it well ahead of the Vulcan's capabilities."", 'It remains to be seen whether ULA will be able to charge a low-enough price on its ""heavy"" Vulcan launches to meet or beat SpaceX pricing, given SpaceX\'s greater lift capacity.', ""That's the bad news.\xa0The worse news for ULA is that, while it has finally managed to develop a rocket (after 10 years) that can compete with SpaceX's 14-year-old Falcon 9, SpaceX hasn't been lazing around the past decade and a half, waiting for ULA to catch up."", 'Rather, SpaceX is hard at work getting its Starship design finalized and tested. And once that behemoth begins launching payloads 100 tons at a time, it will charge as low as $10 million per launch.', ""Let's just say that ULA still has its work cut out for it if it hopes to catch up with SpaceX and stay caught up."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Boeing right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Boeing, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Boeing wasn't one of them.

Those high yields often come joined at the hip with high risk."", ""Investors don't always have to make the trade-off between juicy income and risk, though. Here are three super-safe high-yield dividend stocks you can buy right now."", ""It's important to first know that you can invest in Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIP) (NYSE: BIPC) in a couple of ways. The company's limited partnership (LP) units trade under the BIP ticker, while its corporate shares trade under the BIPC ticker. Both offer great distributions. BIP's yield currently stands at a hair under 5%, with BIPC's yield a little lower at 4.25%."", 'Brookfield Infrastructure has increased its distribution for 14 consecutive years. The company plans to keep that streak going and targets annual distribution growth of 5% to 9%.', ""I think that Brookfield Infrastructure's distribution is rock-solid. The company generated funds from operations (FFO) in the third quarter of 2023 that were nearly two times greater than its quarterly distribution payout. More importantly, its underlying businesses (which include utilities, pipelines, data centers, and more) consistently generate solid cash flow month in and month out."", ""Roughly 90% of Brookfield Infrastructure's cash flow is contracted or regulated. Around 80% of its cash flow is either protected from or indexed to inflation. These factors give me even more confidence that the company's distribution is safe."", ""Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) is a leading midstream energy company that operates more than 50,000 miles of pipeline in North America. It's also a great pick for income investors, in my view, with its distribution yield of nearly 7.7%."", ""How reliable is Enterprise Products Partners' distribution? Very. The company has increased its payout for 25 consecutive years. Even better, the compound annual growth rate of those increases is close to 7%."", 'Although the energy sector can experience significant volatility, Enterprise Products Partners has been a textbook example of resiliency. The company generated double-digit-percentage returns on invested capital (ROIC) and solid cash flow per unit even during the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic period.', ""I'm not worried about the global focus on reducing the use of fossil fuels hurting Enterprise anytime soon. Experts predict that the use of oil and gas will rise over the next few decades even with increased adoption of renewable energy sources. Enterprise Products Partners' exceptional distributions should keep on flowing and growing for a long time to come."", ""I can't think of many dividend stocks that are safer than Johnson & Johnson. It's a Dividend King that has increased its dividend for 61 consecutive years. The problem, though, is that J&J doesn't quite qualify as a high-yield dividend stock. However, we can get many of the positives that J&J offers along with a juicy dividend yield of nearly 3.7% with Kenvue (NYSE: KVUE)."", ""Johnson & Johnson spun off its consumer health business as a stand-alone company last year, naming it Kenvue. The newly formed company inherited all of J&J's iconic consumer health brands, including Band-Aid, Listerine, Neutrogena, and Tylenol."", 'It didn\'t take Kenvue long to declare its first dividend. The company\'s CFO, Paul Ruh, said in the third-quarter conference call in October 2023 that ""dividends serve as an important part of our TSR [total shareholder return] algorithm.""', ""To be sure, Kenvue isn't likely to deliver jaw-dropping growth.

In the third quarter of 2023, Berkshire curiously decided to sell its entire stakes in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Proctor & Gamble (NYSE: PG). Here's why these two blue-chip dividend stocks are still superb buys for most investors."", 'Berkshire Hathaway likely sold its stake in Johnson & Johnson because of the spin-off of its consumer health division into the new company Kenvue. Kenvue owns many popular brands, such as Tylenol, Listerine, and Neutrogena, and generates stable revenues from them.', 'By spinning off its consumer health business, Johnson & Johnson signaled to the market that it wanted to focus on its core healthcare business, with a heavier emphasis on pharmaceuticals and medical devices. These segments are riskier, more competitive, and have shorter product life cycles. Therefore, Johnson & Johnson no longer fits the profile of a typical Buffett stock.', 'However, the healthcare giant still sports an array of features that will be attractive to growth, dividend, and value investors.

Moreover, Proctor & Gamble's 2.5% yield is higher than the average among its large-cap peers, and with a reasonable payout ratio of 60.1%, income investors shouldn't have to worry about the future of its quarterly payments."", 'All that being said, this consumer staples stock is unlikely to outperform the broader market anytime soon, making its dividend program one of the main reasons to hit the buy button', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Johnson & Johnson right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Johnson & Johnson, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Johnson & Johnson wasn't one of them.

And now, with a new focus on its pharmaceuticals and medtech businesses, J&J could step into a new phase of growth."", ""Today, this company we all so easily recognize has 25 platforms that deliver more than $1 billion in annual sales. We can expect growth from a wave of new products, with J&J aiming to launch 20 new ones and 50 expansions of current indications by 2030. But we also shouldn't overlook the power of the company's current products."", 'J&J said at the recent JPMorgan Healthcare Conference that one of the major drivers of growth for its pharma business is its existing portfolio, with plenty of growth opportunities ahead for oncology drugs Darzalex and Carvykti and potential expansion of immunology drug Tremfya into inflammatory bowel disease. In medtech, constant innovation should help the company reach its goal of one-third of sales coming from new products by 2027.', ""The $13 billion in proceeds J&J generated from its consumer health spinoff, along with the company's $15 billion in free cash flow, should help it support the pipeline -- and continue increasing its annual dividend as it's done for more than 60 years."", 'J&J has delivered total returns of more than 124% to investors over the past decade, and thanks to its new focus on growth, it may be able to do even better in the years ahead.', ""Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is another company that's probably represented in your household -- this time, in your kitchen.

People have come back to Coca-Cola over time and through generations, and the company has demonstrated its strength by its ability to raise prices during difficult times without losing customers.', 'We saw this last year, as even through difficult economic times and price increases to compensate for higher costs, Coca-Cola continued to report rising earnings. In the most recent quarter, the beverage giant reported gains in revenue, global unit case volume, and earnings per share. Coca-Cola also continued to win share in the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages market.', ""So, there's reason to be confident about the company's ability to maintain this momentum into the future as well. But market strength isn't the only reason to like Coca-Cola. The company also makes a great buy thanks to its dividend policy."", 'Like J&J, Coca-Cola has lifted its dividend for more than 50 straight years, putting it on the list of Dividend Kings. This shows dividend growth is important to Coca-Cola, so I would expect the company to continue along that path. Coca-Cola, with more than $10 billion in free cash flow, also has the financial strength to keep these payments climbing.', 'Today, Coca-Cola shares trade for about 21 times forward earnings estimates.

ULA plans to launch a second Vulcan in April, sending a Dream Chaser space plane to the International Space Station for Sierra Space."", ""With that accomplished, ULA will launch four more times before the year is through, making for a total of six spaceflights this year. That's twice\xa0as many launches as ULA was able to accomplish in 2023."", 'And the Vulcan will just be getting started. While ULA still has Atlas V rockets in its inventory, and will launch that model 17 more times before retiring it, the Vulcan is clearly the future for ULA.', ""CEO Tory Bruno said a total of 70 Vulcan launches are already on order, including no fewer than 38 launches carrying Kuiper satellites for Amazon's planned satellite internet service. To accommodate the workload, ULA has plans to ramp up Vulcan manufacturing to 25 units per year by the end of 2025."", ""To help meet this goal, the company plans to make the Vulcan partly reusable, detaching the rocket's main engine after launch and parachuting it back to earth, where it will be retrieved by helicopter and reused. If ULA can do this, it should also be able to cut the cost of its launches, with engines making up 65% of the cost of building a rocket."", ""Last month, I wrote about how recent Pentagon contract awards proved ULA's success in fulfilling Bruno's vow to reduce launch costs. A recent packet of 11 Space Force launches was awarded at an average cost of only $118 million per launch. As Reuters reported this week, the company plans to charge even less for some future launches -- as little as $110 million."", ""Of particular note, that same Space Force award saw SpaceX charging $120 million per launch, although some of these will use more-powerful Falcon Heavy rockets. That caveat aside, it actually looks like ULA has fulfilled its promise to build a rocket capable of matching SpaceX's pricing, or at least come really close."", ""But will ULA be able to keep competing on price with SpaceX? Perhaps. Without boosters, ULA's base-model Vulcan can carry 10.8 metric tons of cargo to low earth orbit (LEO). SpaceX's booster-less Falcon 9 rocket, though, can carry more than twice that cargo to LEO for a lower price."", ""A boosted version of the Vulcan is expected to eventually be able to put 27.2 metric tons of cargo into orbit. But even there, SpaceX's ability to deliver 63.5 tons to LEO with the Falcon Heavy puts it well ahead of the Vulcan's capabilities."", 'It remains to be seen whether ULA will be able to charge a low-enough price on its ""heavy"" Vulcan launches to meet or beat SpaceX pricing, given SpaceX\'s greater lift capacity.', ""That's the bad news.\xa0The worse news for ULA is that, while it has finally managed to develop a rocket (after 10 years) that can compete with SpaceX's 14-year-old Falcon 9, SpaceX hasn't been lazing around the past decade and a half, waiting for ULA to catch up."", 'Rather, SpaceX is hard at work getting its Starship design finalized and tested. And once that behemoth begins launching payloads 100 tons at a time, it will charge as low as $10 million per launch.', ""Let's just say that ULA still has its work cut out for it if it hopes to catch up with SpaceX and stay caught up."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Boeing right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Boeing, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Boeing wasn't one of them.

There, poking out of one of the cedar trees he’d planted 20 years ago in his back garden in suburban Portland, Oregon, was something “gleaming and white”, he told NBC News.', 'Sauer, a 64-year-old physics teacher at a local private school, had stumbled upon the most crucial piece of evidence in what had already become a major investigation: the missing cabin door blown out of a Boeing 737 Max 9 plane just minutes after take-off earlier that weekend.', 'Though miraculously there were no fatalities, the incident threatens to spiral into another costly crisis for Boeing as fresh questions are asked about the safety and reliability of the 737 Max jet.', 'The model has only recently come back into service after being grounded for 20 months following its involvement in two deadly crashes in 2019 that killed nearly 400 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia.', 'The disasters left Boeing battling the biggest crisis since it was founded more than a century ago as it sought to restore its reputation and weather the financial storm – the 737 accounted for roughly a third of the company’s $100bn annual turnover at the time.', 'Chief executive Dave Calhoun is now desperately trying to calm a storm that wiped nearly $14bn off the aerospace titan’s stock market valuation in a single day. Yet even if he can steady the ship in the short-term, there is another threat on the horizon: Boeing’s latest mishap may have presented China’s communist party with an unexpected opportunity to win over the skies.', 'For more than a decade, state-owned aircraft manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) has been working on a jet programme that it hopes will enable it to compete with Boeing and Airbus on the international stage. Could Boeing’s latest troubles enable Beijing’s stuttering plan to finally get airborne?', 'The C919, a narrow-body, twin-engine aircraft that is intended to be a challenger to models such as the 737 Max and the Airbus A320, made its maiden flight in June last year to much fanfare – at home at least. China’s State Council called it “a huge breakthrough…a major milestone of China’s aviation market”.', 'President Xi Jinping declared that the plane “carries the will of the state, the dream of the nation and the hope of the people”, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. He has also said China won’t be considered a “true power” until it has developed its own airliner.', 'But despite the regime ploughing tens of billions of dollars into the project, and extensive collaboration with Western aerospace companies, orders of the C919 plane have not yet met Beijing’s expectations.', 'Outside of China, the C919 was initially greeted with extreme scepticism bordering on ridicule at times.', 'Experts pointed to the massive challenges in building a commercial plane from scratch. They scoffed at the idea that Comac would ever get approval for the C919 from regulators in Europe or the US, meaning it would struggle to be anything more than a local supplier, or a fringe player at best.', 'In the unlikely event that it is given the green light, the idea that airlines outside of the country would consider buying planes assembled in China, never mind succeed in persuading their customers to board one, seemed even more far-fetched.', 'China was accused of lacking the technical nous. Some questioned whether the technology deployed in the C919 was in danger of being obsolete before the plane was even airborne because of the long delays in bringing it to market. The vast sums of money needed to get it off the ground were seen as an insurmountable hurdle too.', '“The C919 can never be a successful commercial initiative,” Scott Kennedy at The Centre for Strategic and International Studies, says. The Washington-based think tank spent several years scrutinising the programme, and concluded that Comac was “an aerospace minor-leaguer”.', '“Comac… is not in the same league as the world’s top commercial aircraft manufacturers,” it said.', 'Could Boeing’s latest mishap improve the C919’s fortunes and clear Beijing’s plans for take-off? Opinion was already shifting in some quarters before Alaska Airline flight 1282 from Portland International, Oregon, was forced into an emergency landing.', 'Until recently, Shukor Yusof of Endau Analytics, a Singapore-based aviation consultancy, was one of the doubters. He thought few airlines outside of mainland China would be able to get over the stigma of buying a commercial jet that was assembled in the country.', 'Comac’s failure to sufficiently distinguish its planes, and the length of time it is likely to take for overseas regulators to certify them, would put off buyers, he believed.', 'But Yusof has been quickly won over as the C919 has zipped off the production line and Comac’s order book has steadily climbed, including outside of China.', '“I still think the ‘Made in China’ label comes with a bit of stigma but it’s becoming less so – a lot of the smaller airlines throughout the world, especially in Southeast Asia, have indicated they are more than willing to try out this aircraft,” he says.', 'Orders like the one China Eastern lodged for 100 C919s at a cost of $10bn are taken for granted because of pressure from Beijing to support the national cause. But in December Comac received its first overseas purchase. Brunei’s GallopAir has agreed a $2bn deal to buy 30 planes, including 15 of the C919. There is interest from Indonesia and Tibet Air too.', 'Yusof expects other countries in Asia, Africa and possibly eastern Europe to follow suit, as the business rationale becomes harder to ignore.', 'For one thing, the C919 is readily available. “You could get one tomorrow,” he says. By contrast, the waiting time for a Boeing or Airbus plane is years.', 'The C919 is also much cheaper.', '“They’re [Comac] willing to bend over backwards and offload the aircraft at a significant discount,” Yusof says. “We’re talking about a 15pc to 20pc saving. They’re not in it to make money. This is a national project.”', 'Competing with the 737 is a gargantuan undertaking. The best-selling commercial airliner ever, it is operated by more than 5,000 airlines in almost 200 countries. At any given moment, there could be more than 1,000 in the sky.', 'Ultimately, the success of the C919 may be determined by Boeing’s capacity for self-harm more than anything else. Growing dismay at the US giant’s increasingly chequered track record may persuade some airlines to take a punt on the C919.', 'Patience with the $235bn American aviation behemoth was already wearing thin after the prolonged grounding of the 737 Max led to a huge order backlog just as the airline industry was poised to rebound from the pandemic.', 'Yusof says people who have long respected and admired Boeing are losing faith. Among them is Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary who has previously told Boeing to “get its sh*t together”.', 'Last week, he expressed concern about ongoing delivery delays and the impact that could have on Ryanair’s bottom line over the busy summer months.', 'Ronald Epstein, an analyst at Bank of America, warns of delays to Max 9 deliveries, the newer Max 7s and Max 10s, as investigators scrutinise Boeing’s sprawling fleet again.', 'Others think Beijing’s desire to compete with Boeing and Airbus has been overstated.', '“Civil aviation is a huge growth driver for China and they are totally reliant on the West for this,” one senior industry executive says.', '“It’s about satiating Chinese domestic demand, not creating a market wildly focused on export. It’s about having independence.”', 'Regardless of the true motive, Boeing’s woes may just play into Comac’s hands as the C919 takes to the skies.', 'Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Investors reacted by selling off the stock, leading to a catastrophic performance for the drugmaker.', ""However, despite its recent struggles, there remain excellent reasons to invest in Pfizer stock. In fact, let's consider seven of them right now."", ""It's not that rare for drugmakers to go through periods of declining sales. Usually, it is because of patent cliffs. In Pfizer's case, it set the bar incredibly high in 2021 and 2022 thanks to its coronavirus products. Whatever the reason, there is a simple way to remedy matters for any pharmaceutical company that finds itself in this situation. The key is to launch brand-new products on the market, ones that will eventually fill the holes left by older ones whose sales are declining."", ""Last year, Pfizer was on a mission and planned to earn many brand-new approvals. That's precisely what the company did: As of the end of 2023, Pfizer earned seven new approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Here is a list of the brand-new products Pfizer launched last year"", 'Drug', 'Indication', 'Zavzpret', 'Migraine', 'Litfulo', 'Alopecia areata', 'Ngenla', 'Growth hormone deficiency', 'Elrexfio', 'Multiple myeloma', 'Velsipity', 'Ulcerative colitis', 'Paxlovid', 'COVID-19', 'Abrysvo', 'Respiratory syncytial virus', ""Let's put that number in context. First, Pfizer usually manages only one or two new launches yearly, so seven is a highly unusual number for the company. Second, last year, no drugmaker other than Pfizer managed more than three approvals, meaning none had even half as many as Pfizer."", ""Third, the FDA gave the green light to 66 new drugs, vaccines, and biologics in 2023. With seven of them going to Pfizer, that means almost 11% of the FDA's approvals in the entire massive pharmaceutical industry were for products developed by a single company."", ""This speaks volumes about Pfizer's innovative potential and the work it was able to accomplish thanks to its success in the coronavirus market."", ""Pfizer's newer products will take some time to ramp up their sales. However, the company's innovative wheel should keep running in the meantime. One major move Pfizer made last year was to acquire cancer expert Seagen for $43 billion. This relatively small oncology specialist has a massive cancer-centric pipeline and several products on the market. Thanks to Pfizer's backing, things could become even more exciting: The company was clearly after Seagen's innovative approach."", 'As CEO Albert Bourla said: ""We are not buying the golden eggs. We are acquiring the goose that is laying the golden eggs. For us, what is extremely important, it is that we will maintain the Seagen capability to continue innovating and do -- under Pfizer\'s umbrellas, Pfizer\'s family to do way more if possible, than they were able to do it alone.""', ""Pfizer has a pipeline full of programs even beyond its acquisition of Seagen. Perhaps the company's number of approvals won't be as impressive this year, but the drugmaker is doing exactly what it's supposed to do to turn the horrible performance it had last year around."", ""After the horror show it experienced last year, Pfizer looks attractively valued at current levels. The company's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13.1 compares favorably to that of the pharmaceutical industry at 17.1. Investors who initiate a position today can also take advantage of the company's solid dividend program. Pfizer may not recover immediately, but the company's long-term prospects look attractive, given its rapidly rejuvenating lineup."", ""Those willing to hold the company's shares for five years or more will be glad they did so down the line."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL)."", ""Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Royal Caribbean Cruises ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Royal Caribbean Cruises is:', '20% = US$925m ÷ US$4.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.20."", ""Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Royal Caribbean Cruises has a higher ROE than the average (16%) in the Hospitality industry."", ""That's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Royal Caribbean Cruises visit our risks dashboard for free."", 'Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.', ""It appears that Royal Caribbean Cruises makes extensive use of debt to improve its returns, because it has an alarmingly high debt to equity ratio of 4.27. Its ROE is respectable, but it's not so impressive once you consider all of the debt."", 'Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

However, the business probably flew under the radar because of all the attention that went to technology and artificial intelligence (AI)-focused companies. I think it's time to turn our attention back to this business. "", 'Should investors buy this top financial stock hand over fist in 2024? Here are three reasons why this could be the smartest move you make this year, as well as one final factor to consider before making a decision.', ""In the past decade, from fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30, 2023), Visa's revenue increased at a compound annual rate of 10.7%. What's impressive is that this growth has been consistent, besides the single-digit decline in 2020 due to the pandemic."", ""Of course, Visa's gains have come on the backs of the rise of digital payments. The digitization of commerce and the ongoing decline in cash usage has propelled this business. And there's no reason to believe this secular trend is going to weaken anytime soon, especially in developing economies. "", ""Even in the U.S., the Pew Research Center's data showed that 58% of Americans still use cash for some or all of their weekly transactions. To be clear, this was from 2022, but you get the idea that there is still a sizable runway for Visa in a developed economy like ours. This should result in strong revenue growth in the foreseeable future."", ""A valid argument can be made that Visa's competitive position is essentially unassailable. The company benefits from powerful network effects that underpin its economic moat. As of Sept. 30, there were 4.3 billion Visa cards in circulation across the globe and some 130 million merchant locations that accept them as a method of payment. Both consumers and businesses have no choice but to be on Visa's network, which becomes more valuable the larger it gets."", 'It would be almost impossible for a new entrant to successfully launch a competing payments network. How would this company even begin to bring on merchants without any cardholders, or vice versa? It seems like a futile endeavor.', 'This all points to the dominance of Visa and just how entrenched it is in our economy. According to Statista, the business has a 61% share of card payments volume domestically.', ""Another reason to add this company to your portfolio is just how remarkable its financials are. Last fiscal year, Visa posted a ridiculous operating margin of 64%. You'd be hard-pressed to find many businesses that are more profitable than this one."", 'Moreover, Visa generates a ton of free cash flow, to the tune of $19.7 billion in fiscal 2023. This is due to the fact that its platform requires minimal capital expenditures, with the technological infrastructure being largely built out and each additional transaction costing close to nothing to process.', 'This affords the management team the ability to return capital to shareholders. Visa spent $12.1 billion on share repurchases and $3.8 billion on dividends in fiscal 2023. ', ""Every investor would agree that Visa is one of the best businesses in the world. The factors I've outlined here point to this reality."", ""And the share price reflects this. In the last decade, Visa's stock has climbed 374%. This gain trounces the performances of both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index by wide margins."", ""So, as of this writing, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 31.7. That's about 50% more expensive than the S&P 500's valuation. This premium probably isn't much of a surprise."", ""On the one hand, a strong argument can be made that Visa deserves to trade at a higher valuation than the overall market. But on the other hand, investors should still be critical of the price they pay for a stock, even if it's of high quality."", ""Buying Visa shares looks like a smart move only if you're comfortable with the valuation. If you're not, perhaps it's best to practice patience and wait for a better entry point."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Not only is it selling every chip it makes, but management mentioned on the November earnings call that it would expand its offering and release new products faster to meet growing demand across a range of AI opportunities."", ""Nvidia has strong relationships with all of the major cloud service providers. Its innovation and long history of specializing in GPU development means it can price its chips at a premium. This is bolstering Nvidia's profit margin and fueling robust earnings growth. While analysts expect Nvidia to post revenue growth of 56% this year, earnings per share are projected to increase by 66%."", ""Those estimates would represent a significant slowdown from the triple-digit growth rates we've seen in recent quarters.

The consensus view now is that AMD's revenue will increase by 17% to $24 billion in 2024.

This was a slight slowdown from fiscal 2023, when revenue rose by 25%.', 'Since the cloud cannot exist without cybersecurity, Palo Alto tends to generate stable or growing revenue, but an uncertain economy may have made clients more hesitant to add services.', 'Nonetheless, the company kept its expenses in check, and as it became profitable on a yearly basis last year, earnings have grown at a rapid pace. Net income in fiscal 2024 Q1 was $194 million versus $20 million in the prior-year quarter.', 'Even with a marginal slowdown in revenue growth, that will likely continue. For the fiscal year, Palo Alto forecasts revenue of approximately $8.2 billion, which would amount to a 19% increase.', 'Additionally, its approach to security has become increasingly popular with investors.

This breakthrough technology can, among other things, create original text and images based on a few user prompts. But that's just the beginning. These sophisticated algorithms can search company databases and the internet for information, summarize emails and draft responses, recap meetings, create presentations from available data, and even write and review computer code. The resulting productivity advances are expected to be worth trillions of dollars, and companies are scrambling to capture their share of this windfall."", ""Investors, too, are looking to profit from this trend, snatching up any stock they can in the field of AI. While that's certainly understandable, not all AI stocks are created equal. One high-profile example is C3.ai (NYSE: AI). The stock soared more than 156% last year, driven by the excitement surrounding AI. A review of the evidence, however, suggests there's a better way for investors to profit from the AI revolution -- one that provides much more upside potential."", 'Investors\' attraction to this stock isn\'t surprising given C3.ai\'s eponymous ticker, but looks can be deceiving. The company bills itself as a ""leading enterprise AI software provider for building enterprise-scale AI applications."" Management goes on to point out that the company ""provides over 40 turnkey enterprise AI applications that meet the business-critical needs of global enterprises,"" serving a number of business and industry verticals.', ""This would seem to suggest that C3.ai would be well situated to benefit from the AI gold rush. However, the company's business performance is lackluster at best."", ""C3.ai's recent financial results held more questions than answers. During its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Oct. 31), C3.ai delivered revenue that grew 17% year over year to $3.2 million, resulting in a loss per share of $0.59, barely improved from the $0.63-per-share loss it generated in the year-ago period. This is particularly troubling given the mad dash to adopt AI over the past year should have dramatically boosted C3.ai's fortunes. But that simply hasn't been the case. Furthermore, the company continues to burn cash, with free cash flow of negative $55.1 million."", 'To be fair, C3.ai is making some progress, boasting of ""a return to accelerating revenue growth,"" though the numbers are hardly inspiring.

Despite its tepid results and weak outlook, the stock sells for 11 times sales, and with not even the suggestion of profitability on the horizon.', 'In the face of unprecedented adoption of AI, C3.ai should be scrambling to meet the burgeoning demand. Given its lackluster performance thus far, investors would do better looking elsewhere to profit from AI.', ""The breakout beneficiary of the AI boom thus far has been Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and the evidence suggests the trend will continue. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) were originally designed to generate lifelike images in video games but have evolved over time."", 'The secret to its success is parallel processing, which takes massive, computationally intensive tasks and breaks them up into bite-sized bits, allowing it to perform a multitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously. Researchers and scientists found this provided the computational horsepower necessary to accelerate AI tasks.', ""Rivals have tried to unseat Nvidia from its position as the industry leader, but those efforts have thus far proven unsuccessful. If you have any doubts, consider this: Nvidia is the leading provider of processors used for machine learning, an earlier, more established branch of AI, according to data supplied by New Street Research. It also maintains an estimated 95% share of the GPUs used in the data center market -- where most business-centric AI lives -- according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino. While the field of generative AI is still in its infancy, it stands to reason that Nvidia will control an equally dominant share of the market. As evidence, there's been a run on Nvidia AI chips that shows no signs of slowing."", 'In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29), Nvidia generated record revenue of $18.1 billion, up 206% year over year, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $3.71 soared 1,274%. Management left no doubt the surging demand was the result of the rapid adoption of AI.', 'For its fiscal fourth quarter, Nvidia forecast all-time high revenue of roughly $20 billion, representing growth of 231% year over year and 10% sequentially.', 'A quick look at its valuation shows that Nvidia stock is remarkably inexpensive. For a high-growth stock like this, the most appropriate valuation metric is the price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio. For Nvidia, this clocks in at less than 1 -- the benchmark for an undervalued stock, compared to 2 for the S&P 500, which shows just how cheap it really is by comparison.', 'The evidence clearly shows that Nvidia is a much better AI stock than C3.ai.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in C3.ai right now?', 'Before you buy stock in C3.ai, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and C3.ai wasn't one of them.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walt Disney as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.222. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Dividend stocks tend to be financially stronger, too, because their management teams have an extra incentive to maintain positive -- and growing -- earnings each year. These characteristics can be quite appealing in times of economic uncertainty."", ""Not all dividend stocks are worth having in your income portfolio, though. There's a mix of winners and losers in this investment niche that's similar to what you might find in any other area of the market. With that in mind, let's look at three standout options that are attractively priced today."", ""Garmin (NYSE: GRMN) is a tech company focused on sales growth, but it still pays a solid dividend that currently yields over 2%. The GPS device specialist is putting up excellent operating results as well. Revenue in the third quarter was up a healthy 12% year over year as four of its five major segments set sales records. This performance showed off the power of Garmin's diverse revenue streams, too, as gains in areas like fitness trackers and smartwatches offset weaker growth in the marine and aviation divisions."", ""Garmin generates ample cash flow that management directs mostly toward generating more growth through areas like research and development. That's because a steady stream of product launches is necessary to lay the groundwork for rising revenue. Yet its high profit margin (above 21% of sales last quarter) also leaves room for a generous dividend payment to bolster shareholder returns over time."", ""McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) isn't just one of the most profitable businesses in the fast-food industry; it is also among the most profitable companies in the stock market. The restaurant owner's operating profit margin recently crossed 45% of sales thanks to a combination of strong demand, rising prices, and a steady stream of franchise, royalty, and rent fees from its partners."", ""There are some challenges facing this business, to be sure. McDonald's reported a modest drop in customer traffic in the core U.S. market last quarter that investors are hoping was just a temporary blip in its wider positive growth story. Rivals like Chipotle Mexican Grill are increasingly targeting the drive-thru channel and aiming to take share from the industry leader as well."", ""Yet McDonald's has handled many such trials in its history, as evidenced by its track record of 47 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. The 2024 payout will be 10% higher than last year's, which shareholders should find especially tasty for their overall returns."", ""Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) isn't your traditional retailer business because most of its earnings come from membership fees rather than product markups. The wholesale club earns essentially nothing from its massive sales base of merchandise. Yet Costco is still a cash-rich business, as you can see from management's recent decision to send a special dividend payment valued at $7 billion to distribute among its shareholders. Cash balances should still be well above $10 billion following that payout."", ""You might prefer a more steadily rising dividend payment over these sporadic one-time checks. But Costco investors can cut the company slack in this area given the chain's stellar track record of market share growth in the highly competitive retail industry. That's why looking back in a few years, there's a good chance you'll love having had this dividend payer in your portfolio."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Costco Wholesale wasn't one of them.

For example, an investment that can deliver a 13% annual rate of return can double in value in less than six years. While 13% is an above-average return, many high-quality dividend stocks have delivered an average annual total return above that level over the past decade (and can continue doing so in the future). ', ""Prologis (NYSE: PLD) and Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC)(NYSE: BEP) are high-performing dividend stocks. They should have the fuel to double investors' money in less than six years."", ""Prologis has delivered a prodigious 16.8% average annual total return over the last decade (and 16.7% over the previous six years). Its rapidly rising dividend is a big driver of the leading industrial REIT's strong performance. Prologis has increased its dividend at a 12% compound annual rate over the last five years, supported by a similar growth rate in its core funds from operations (FFO). That's double the average dividend growth rate of the other REITs and companies in the S&P 500. "", ""The warehouse giant is in an excellent position to continue growing its core FFO and dividend at high rates in the future. The REIT expects to grow its core FFO per share by 9% to 11% annually through at least 2026, driven by rent growth and development projects. There's upside to that forecast. Over the past several years, it has added an average of 1.5% to its FFO per share annually by making accretive acquisitions. Given its elite balance sheet, Prologis has ample financial flexibility to make new investments. "", ""Prologis' forecast (and recent history) suggests the REIT could grow its dividend in line with core FFO, implying the potential of increasing its 2.7%-yielding payout at around a double-digit annual rate. That should give it the power to produce total returns of around 12% annually at the low end to 15%+ at the high end if it makes accretive acquisitions in line with its recent average."", 'Brookfield Renewable has generated an impressive 13.4% average annual total return over the last decade (and 13.1% over the previous six years). The global renewable energy juggernaut has expanded its FFO per share at a more than 10% compound annual rate over the last 10 years. That gave it the power to grow its dividend at a 6% compound annual rate. ', 'The company could grow even faster in the coming years:', 'As that slide shows, a trio of organic catalysts could power 7% to 12% annual FFO per share growth through at least 2028. On top of that, Brookfield sees mergers and acquisitions (M&A) potentially adding more than 9% to its FFO per share each year. That easily supports its plan of growing its dividend by 5% to 9% annually.', ""Several factors drive Brookfield's robust M&A potential. On the one hand, it has ample access to capital. Brookfield Renewable routinely recycles capital by selling mature assets and using the proceeds to fund higher-return new investments. On top of that, the company and its parent, Brookfield Asset Management, have a growing Brookfield Global Transition Fund (BGTF) platform. The companies are working to close their second BGTF, which aims to raise around $20 billion. That's about $5 billion more than the record $15 billion raised in the first fund. "", 'Meanwhile, new investment opportunities abound. While the company\'s acquisition of Australian utility Origin Energy failed to win shareholder support, it\'s seeing ""plentiful opportunities to deploy capital at or above our target returns,"" according to CEO Connor Teskey. That drives the company\'s confidence in achieving its goal of deploying $7 billion to $8 billion of equity capital on new investments over the next five years, a portion of which it will deploy through its BGTFs. ', 'With a dividend yield of around 4.6% and the potential to deliver more than 10% annual FFO per share growth, Brookfield should have no trouble achieving its long-term target of producing 12% to 15% average annual total returns. ', ""Prologis and Brookfield Renewable have delivered a total return above 13% annually over the past decade. They're well positioned to match (or exceed) that rate over the next several years.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$135). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.', ""Insiders in Estée Lauder Companies didn't buy any shares in the last year.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Estée Lauder Companies insiders own 12% of the company, worth about US$5.6b. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders."", ""It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Estée Lauder Companies shares in the last quarter. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Estée Lauder Companies, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Our analysis shows 4 warning signs for Estée Lauder Companies (1 is significant!) and we strongly recommend you look at them before investing."", 'If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.', 'For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Investors will want to watch this metric over the coming quarters, but in the meantime, they can own Pepsi's stock at a discount and collect passive income from its steadily rising dividend payment."", 'Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA) shares sat out of the rally last year, shedding a few percentage points compared to the over 20% increase in the S&P 500. Investors should consider that decline a compelling discount for this attractive business.', 'The spa and beauty products retailer is growing at a slower rate than investors have seen in recent years, of course. Yet its customer traffic trends are healthy, having risen 6% in the most recent quarter. This boost was partially offset by lower average spending due to the price cuts that are impacting all industry players right now.', ""Ulta isn't giving up much ground on profitability, though. Operating profit margin landed at 15% of sales last quarter, down slightly from 17% a year ago and still well above the pre-pandemic rate."", ""The stock should benefit from Ulta's continued sales growth in its existing locations, its online segment, and its new store launches. Watch for this stock to have a better year in 2024."", 'Investors had some good reasons to be down on eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) stock last year. The digital marketplace platform is still going through a growth hangover, with sales volumes barely rising in the last two years.', ""Yet that's a challenge that applies to the entire industry and isn't a reflection of eBay losing market share. Shoppers simply decided to spend less on consumer discretionary purchases this past year."", 'eBay is making the best of a tough situation. Its advertising and payments processing segments are growing nicely, and the company is rolling out upgrades to its shopping experience that are pushing customer satisfaction higher.', ""You'll also have trouble finding a more financially strong business in the marketplace industry. eBay generates almost 20% profit margins and plenty of cash flow. As a result, investors can expect their returns to be boosted by eBay's dividend and aggressive buyback spending in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PepsiCo wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.
