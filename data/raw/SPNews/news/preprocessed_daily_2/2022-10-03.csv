The industry loss estimate from Verisk Extreme Event Solutions includes estimated wind, storm surge, and inland flood losses resulting from Ian’s landfalls in both Florida and South Carolina. The loss estimate excludes certain elements, such as losses to the National Flood Insurance Program and any potential impacts of litigation or social inflation, that could cause the total insured industry loss to exceed USD 60 billion.Wind damage of USD 38 to 51 billion comprises the majority of the loss estimate. Storm surge (excluding losses from the NFIP) account for USD 3 to 5.5 billion of the loss estimate, and inland flood less than USD 1 billion. Approximately 1 percent of the total industry loss will come from the impacts of Ian’s South Carolina landfall.Overview of the damage Wind damage in varying degree was observed in all the areas impacted by Hurricane Ian’s windfield. Damage was more severe in and around the areas where Ian made landfall in southwest Florida. It ranged from significant loss of roof covers in residential homes to torn up roof membranes in commercial structures. Extensive damage is also seen to elements of building components and cladding.Storm surge also caused massive destruction to communities along the western coast of Florida where Ian made landfall. Residential construction in these areas are predominantly founded on slabs which do not afford a lot of elevation above the local ground surface. Surge damage caused collapse of several rows of beachfront residential homes. In some cases, homes were dislodged from their foundations.Story continuesManufactured homes constitute a significant portion of the residential inventory in southwest Florida when Ian made landfall. Several manufactured home parks in these areas saw massive damage including loss of roofs, damage to wall siding and near total destruction.What’s included in Verisk’s estimateIncluded in the estimate are losses to onshore residential, commercial, and industrial properties and automobiles for their building, contents, and time element coverage. The estimate reflects the impacts of inflation on labor and materials over the past two years, as well as the effects of demand surge, when large numbers of property owners look to rebuild at the same time.Verisk’s modeled insured loss estimates do not include:Losses to inland marine, ocean-going marine cargo and hull, and pleasure boatsLoss adjustment expensesLosses exacerbated by litigation, fraudulent assignment of benefits, or social inflationLosses paid out by the National Flood Insurance ProgramStorm surge leakage losses paid on wind-only policies due to government interventionLosses to uninsured propertiesLosses to infrastructureLosses from extra-contractual obligationsLosses from hazardous waste cleanup, vandalism, or civil commotion, whether directly or indirectly caused by the eventLosses resulting from the compromise of existing defenses (e.g., natural and man-made levees)Other non-modeled losses, including those resulting from tornadoes spawned by the stormLosses for U.S. offshore assets and non-U.S. propertyHow the hurricane unfolded and broke recordsHeavy rain, storm surge, and tropical storm conditions began across portions of southwest Florida late Tuesday afternoon. Overnight Ian slid past the Florida Keys. Despite receiving a glancing blow from Ian, Key West recorded its third-highest storm surge since 1913 at just over 3 feet and peak wind gusts into the upper-60s mph.Conditions deteriorated rapidly in western Florida as Wednesday morning progressed, with heavy rainfall spreading northward and major-hurricane-force winds from Ian’s eyewall coming onshore late morning near Fort Myers Beach and Sanibel Island. To the south, in Naples and surrounding areas, Ian’s powerful winds were oriented perpendicular to the coast, which exacerbated the water inundation caused by storm surge as water from the Gulf was effectively blown inland. As a result, Naples saw over 6 feet of catastrophic storm surge, shattering the previous record.Ian officially made landfall at Cayo Costa, Florida at 3:05 PM local time as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph. Around this time, a 124-mph wind gust was observed in Punta Gorda before the station failed. Ian then slowly proceeded inland, following a northeasterly track that led the storm’s massive 30-mile-wide eye (wider than the east-west extent of Lake Okeechobee) over Gasparilla Sound and Punta Gorda.Owing to the storm’s slow motion, areas like Port Charlotte and Englewood remained in Ian’s eyewall for several hours; this resulted in 18 – 20 inches of rainfall in addition to prolonged exposure to the powerful wind gusts located in Ian’s northwestern eyewall. Ian managed to stay about 65 miles southwest of Tampa, which owing to Ian’s large wind field was still close enough to bring wind gusts into the upper-70s mph and 2 – 5 inches of rainfall; before that, Tampa Bay was temporarily drained of water because of inverse storm surge from Ian.On Thursday morning, Ian moved off the Atlantic coast near Cape Canaveral – a bit further south than previously expected. As Ian moved back over the ocean on Thursday, conditions were favorable enough for some additional strengthening and Ian was upgraded to a hurricane as of Thursday evening.Ian made a second landfall on Friday afternoon at 2:05 pm EDT near Georgetown, SC as a mid-range Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph. Heavy rainfall and strong gusty winds of more than 50 mph impacted portions of the Carolinas. With these impacts ongoing, Ian was officially declared post-tropical at 5pm as the center moved into northeast South Carolina.Hurricane Ian brought significant storm surge damage to southwest Florida, to both residential and commercial exposures.  However, the flood insurance take-up on residential risks in Florida are low.About Extreme Event Solutions at VeriskExtreme event solutions at Verisk provides risk modeling solutions that help individuals, businesses, and society become more resilient to extreme events.

Before fees and expenses, FNDX seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Large Co. Index.The Russell RAFI US Large Company Index measures the performance of the large company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.25% for FNDX, making it on par with most peer products in the space.Story continuesIt's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 0%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.FNDX's heaviest allocation is in the Information Technology sector, which is about 16.10% of the portfolio. Its Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.When you look at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 4.39% of the fund's total assets, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 19.55% of FNDX's total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the Schwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index ETF has lost about -17.83% so far, and is down about -9.46% over the last 12 months (as of 10/03/2022). FNDX has traded between $47.76 and $59.90 in this past 52-week period.FNDX has a beta of 0.99 and standard deviation of 24.73% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space. With about 729 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) tracks Russell 1000 Value Index and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) tracks CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $47.19 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $89.43 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Value.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

4,fb056950-3bda-3276-9399-87a011977532,WMT,2022-10-03,Is Walmart Inc.'s (NYSE:WMT) Stock's Recent Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-inc-nyse-wmt-stocks-110016261.html,1664794816,STORY,['WMT'],"[Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) stock is up by 5.8% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Walmart's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Walmart How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Walmart is:16% = US$14b ÷ US$86b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.16 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Walmart's Earnings Growth And 16% ROETo begin with, Walmart seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 14% the company's ROE looks quite decent. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 8.2% seen over the past five years by Walmart.We then compared Walmart's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 15% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is WMT fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Walmart Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Walmart has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 45% (or a retention ratio of 55%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Moreover, Walmart is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 35% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 23% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Walmart's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

5,5757e0e0-5419-3863-8a26-b27d1d51c81f,WMT,2022-10-03,Hollywood-Backed Startup Wants You to Try Its Low-Carb Bagel,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hollywood-backed-startup-wants-try-110014578.html,1664794814,STORY,['WMT'],"[(Bloomberg) -- California has long sought to replicate New York’s world-famous bagels. From the low-calcium Manhattan tap water to the specialized boiling techniques, countless West Coast shops have struggled to recreate the signature crust and texture of the fabled deli staple. Now, a new celebrity-backed bagel venture has stopped trying.Most Read from BloombergTrump Says US Agency Packed Top-Secret Documents. These Emails Suggest Otherwise.Nord Stream Leaks Caused by Detonations in Sign of SabotageSecretive Chip Startup May Help Huawei Circumvent US SanctionsMass Shooting in Thailand Leaves 38 Dead, Mostly ChildrenMusk Revives $44 Billion Twitter Bid, Aiming to Avoid TrialInstead, it’s making a bagel that’s quintessentially Los Angeles: a round piece of bread with a hole in the middle, and 90% fewer carbs.The unusually healthy bagel is the creation of BetterBrand, a startup that has raised more than $5 million. Its investors include Reddit Inc. co-founder Alexis Ohanian’s firm, a founder of driverless car business Cruise and streaming platform Twitch, the Shameless actress Emmy Rossum and Patrick Schwarzenegger, son of Arnold. The company is currently in the late stages of raising another, several-times-larger funding round, its chief executive said, declining to give the new total or the valuation.Aimee Yang founded BetterBrand after experiencing the guilt that’s attendant with eating normal food. “I’d literally dream of this world where we could eat what we wanted and never have to worry about weight gain,” said Yang, BetterBrand’s chief executive officer. “It really consumed so much of my mindspace and was such a point of anxiety. Enabling us to eat what we want is so incredibly freeing and empowering.”Now, Yang wants her company to be the “Beyond Meat of carbs.” BetterBrand follows a long line of venture capital-backed companies seeking to reinvent the food we eat, from Soylent’s meal replacement beverages to Upside Foods, which has raised more than $600 million in its quest to develop lab-grown meat. Athletic Greens, which makes a green powdered vitamin blend, vaulted to unicorn status earlier this year. And vegan burger startup Impossible Foods was valued by investors at $7 billion.Story continuesLow-carb bagels aren’t exactly new — similar products exist on shelves at Walmart and Kroger. But Yang has a grander vision. Whole Foods started carrying the bagels last month, about a year after BetterBrand began selling them online, and the company plans to soon offer its products in stores across Europe and Latin America. Eventually, the company hopes to not only remake bagels, but a variety of bread products, like pretzels.While the company makes most of its money from direct sales at the moment, Yang expects its wholesales business to grow. In addition to expanding to other grocers in new markets, Yang said she is in discussions with airlines to place the bagels in airport lounges.BetterBrand has a natural home in Los Angeles, the city that’s both health-obsessed and gourmet, and which also brought us companies like Moon Juice—the venture-backed wellness brand that sells supplements like Magnesi-Om and Sex Dust. BetterBrand says each of its bagels contains the same sugar content as a stalk of celery and the protein content of four eggs. The bagels come in familiar flavors: classic, everything, cinnamon, chocolate chip and, for the fall, pumpkin spice.Of course, some bagel purists resist the new creation. “I would not call it a better bagel,” said Emily Winston, the owner of Berkeley, California-based Boichik Bagels, who recently sampled a BetterBrand’s classic flavor that she ordered on Instacart. Winston spent years trying to recreate the New York-style bagels of her childhood, the result of which is her bakery. Winston described the Better Bagel as “foamy,” “spongey” and “almost like cotton.” “It’s like a mirage of a bagel. I’d eat them before I starved to death,” she said. But, “I don't think everyone’s going to start eating these and stop eating regular bagels.”In a taste test, Bloomberg staffers found that the classic bagel was, by a wide margin, not better than a regular bagel and, remarkably, had almost no flavor at all, except for an aftertaste of margarine. The hallmark of a bagel, a dense and chewy interior, was instead lightweight and turned gummy upon chewing, making it difficult to swallow. Topped with cream cheese, though, the experience hardly improved. The chocolate chip version was not significantly redeemed by the cocoa bits.One of the selling points for the Better Bagel is that it’s both lower in carbohydrates and higher in protein and fiber than its traditional doughy counterpart. One testimonial on the company’s website notes, “I never would've imagined not feeling guilty after eating two bagels.” But dietician Alissa Rumsey warned that prebiotic inulin fiber, a key ingredient in the bagels, doesn’t get absorbed by the body. Too much could lead to trouble. “I could see this causing constipation for someone,” said Rumsey, author of a book called Unapologetic Eating who resists labeling food as inherently good or bad.Yang said her goal isn’t to make bagel-eaters feel guilty. “Us transforming the bagel is definitely a celebration of the product itself,” she said. “It’s about addressing a feeling I think a lot of people relate to, and turning that feeling that already exists of guilt or anxiety into a sense of freedom, or empowerment or joy.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Massive Gas Field That Europe Can’t UseEven After $100 Billion, Self-Driving Cars Are Going NowhereMillions in Cryptocurrency Vanished as Agents Watched Helplessly‘I Am Energy’: Inside the Bang Billionaire’s Reeling EmpireMusk Won’t Own Twitter Until the Shareholders Get Paid©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

As a result, even the more affluent customers have turned to stores that offer lower prices.""I think Walmart believes it has the right to win more wallet share with those consumers,"" Lasser said, adding that ""the implication of a recession for a retailer like Walmart is that it's going to benefit. There's no better way for a consumer to stretch a dollar through lower prices than going to Walmart.""Why a tough environment is 'good for Walmart'The company announced in September it plans to hire an additional 40,000 employees for the holidays despite current margin pressures.It's significantly lower than the 150,000 employees that were hired last year for the holidays, but Lasser said it's still a ""prudent"" strategy on Walmart's end.Consumer appetite for holiday spending has seemingly increased, according to a consumer spending survey conducted by Stifel, while net discretionary spending intentions ticked up by 10% in mid-September.""There's a lot of uncertainty with the consumer,"" Lasser said. ""Also, keep in mind a lot of the sales gains that have been driven throughout retail and Walmart have been due to inflation rather than transactions. So when you're seeing increases in the amount spent per transaction or amount spent per consumer, you don't need as much labor to process those transactions.""Story continuesA Walmart worker organizes products for Christmas season at a Walmart store in Teterboro, New Jersey, REUTERS/Eduardo MunozOn top of that, Lasser noted, the company has invested more in its technology to increase efficiency for its existing workers. These courses of action allow the company to be more aggressive in other areas of the business during the holiday shopping season.As competitors like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) falter, Walmart can capitalize on those struggles by gaining market share.""In a more challenging overall retail landscape, it's likely there's going to be more consolidation,"" Lasser said. ""The marginal retailers are going to maybe have a difficult time surviving. That would leave more share for Walmart to gain. And in any of those scenarios, a tough environment is good for Walmart.""—Ethan is a writer for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest trending stock tickers of the Yahoo Finance platformClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

(NYSE:JWN) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Nordstrom Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$478.0mUS$603.8mUS$454.0mUS$374.0mUS$330.1mUS$304.8mUS$290.3mUS$282.3mUS$278.5mUS$277.5mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x1Est @ -17.62%Est @ -11.75%Est @ -7.64%Est @ -4.77%Est @ -2.76%Est @ -1.35%Est @ -0.36% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$444US$522US$365US$279US$229US$197US$174US$157US$144US$134(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.6bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$278m× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (7.6%– 1.9%) = US$5.0bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.0b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$2.4bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$5.1b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$16.7, the company appears quite undervalued at a 47% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Nordstrom as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.331. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Nordstrom, there are three fundamental factors you should look at:Risks: Take risks, for example - Nordstrom has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which can't be ignored)  we think you should know about.Future Earnings: How does JWN's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

That is, there were more number of shares purchased by insiders than there were sold.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider Marc Oken made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$837k worth of shares at a price of US$167 each. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$149 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. Marc Oken was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$180m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies shares in the last quarter.

A lack of understanding of benefit options is only compounding the financial insecurity remote workers feel today,"" said Bradd Chignoli, senior vice president, Group Benefits at MetLife. ""Benefits can provide financial stability in times of economic turbulence and, when used the right way, are a tool that can even lighten employees’ financial burdens and anxiety.""As the workforce continues to change post-pandemic, meeting employees’ diverse needs – including location – is a growing challenge. MetLife’s survey indicates potential gaps in communication to the remote workforce.Two-thirds of remote workers (65%) say that a better understanding of open enrollment would help make them feel more financially secure. Potential gaps exist in benefit education for these employees. Consequently, remote employees:Are 2x more likely to say they enrolled in the wrong type of benefits last yearRequire more information to make the right benefit choices (57% vs. 47% of hybrid and on-site workers)MetLife’s data also finds that employees who understand and actively utilize their benefits are more loyal, thus proving beneficial for employee retention. Three in five fully remote workers (61%) say their employer’s benefits are a significant part of what’s keeping them at their company, and this is even higher for work-from-home caregivers with children under 18 (72%) and millennial/Gen Z workers (67%).Story continuesThe state of an employee’s financial well-being is often directly linked to their benefits usage. In fact, 43% of all employees say their benefits have helped them out of financial difficulty this year, and 44% say they have helped improve their overall financial health.""We’re at a critical moment in the employee-employer relationship. As we look to build more inclusive cultures and further support today’s workforce – including how and where our employees work – benefit communication is vital,"" said Jenn Kischell, vice president, Workforce Engagement at MetLife.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Occidental Petroleum OXY, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Hess Corp. HES.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Oil Reclaims $80 After EIA Reports Supply Draw on All FrontsU.S. oil prices bounced back from an eight-month low after government data showed a weekly draw in crude, gasoline and distillate supplies.A decline in stocks across the board together with a falling dollar and supply disruptions from Hurricane Ian saw the commodity rise above $80-a-barrel. However, it remained under pressure from recessionary fears.On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures settled at $81.23 a barrel yesterday. Investors should know that oil slipped to a nine-month low of around $77 earlier in the week — the lowest since January.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Sep 23.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 215,000 barrels compared to expectations of a 300,000-barrel decrease per the analysts. The combination of a surge in exports, lower imports and a dip in domestic production accounted for the stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer even as refinery demand contracted.Total domestic stocks now stand at 430.6 million barrels — 2.9% more than the year-ago figure but 2% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) rose 692,000 barrels to 25.7 million barrels.Story continuesMeanwhile, the crude supply cover increased from 26.7 days in the previous week to 26.9 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 28.2 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies decreased for the second time in three weeks. The 2.4 million-barrel fall was primarily attributable to a surge in demand. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would rise 900,000 barrels. At 212.2 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 4.3% less than the year-earlier level and 6% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) dropped after rising for four weeks in a row. The 2.9 million-barrel fall reflected an uptick in demand and lower production. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply draw of some 100,000 barrels. Despite the recent decreases, current inventories — at 114.4 million barrels — are 11.8% below the year-ago level and 20% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 90.6%, fell 3% from the prior week.Final WordWTI prices recently posted its longest run of weekly losses in 2022 following the Federal Reserve's decision to hike interest rates further in line with many other central banks across the world to step up the fight against soaring inflation. The tightening monetary policies have sparked concerns about a possible recession and, consequently, slowing crude demand. A stronger greenback, which can weaken dollar-denominated commodities like crude, also contributed to the downside.What stands out is that rates may not have peaked yet, and more toughness could be in store for the remainder of this year and 2023. This is because attempts are being made to cool the 40-year high inflation and prevent it from becoming entrenched.However, the U.S. benchmark has regained some ground in the wake of EIA’s bullish inventory report. Prices also drew support from the greenback’s climbdown from a 20-year high, which can strengthen dollar-denominated commodities like crude.As it is, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group (OPEC+) agreeing on a production curtailment, the Oil/Energy market has enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.As a matter of fact, the Energy Select Sector SPDR — an assortment of the largest U.S. companies thronging the space — has risen nearly 31% year to date against a 24% loss for the broader S&amp;P 500 benchmark.Consequently, three of the top five gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum, Marathon Petroleum and Hess Corp.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 114%.

The pound gains after the U.K. government makes an embarrassing U-turn on its tax cuts for high earners. Credit Suisse stock falls to a record low as its CEO fails to reassure markets of its financial stability. Tesla slumps in premarket after weak delivery numbers, and the IEA warns of major fears over gas supplies this winter, as Russian troops retreat from areas annexed by Moscow on Friday. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 3rd October.1. Crude rallies as OPEC+ flags output cutCrude oil prices rallied, along with oil and gas stocks, after reports suggesting that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will cut output by 1 million barrels a day when they meet in Vienna on Wednesday. It will be the group's first in-person meeting of the year.The bloc has been unnerved by the sharp drop in prices during the last quarter, which left U.S. crude futures down 23% and Brent down 25% from their levels at the end of June. Higher U.S. interest rates, a more expensive dollar and the accompanying prospect of a worldwide economic slowdown have all weighed on prices in recent weeks.By 06:40 ET (10:40 GMT), U.S. crude futures were up 4.0% at $82.84 a barrel, while Brent was up 3.9% at $88.47 a barrel. In the stock market, BP (LON:BP) stock rose 2.1% and TotalEnergies (EPA:TTEF) stock rose by 2.2%, while in the U.S. premarket, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock rose by 2.7% and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) stock rose by 2.6%.2. U.K. U-turnThe U.K. government executed an embarrassing about-face, dropping its plans to cut taxes for the country's highest earners after a furious political backlash from both the public and from Conservative lawmakers fearing the loss of their own seats at the next election.""We get it,"" the Chancellor of the Exchequer tweeted, in a statement acknowledging that the scrapping of the top 45% rate of income tax had become a ""distraction"".Story continuesThe pound and short-term government bonds strengthened a little on the news, on perceptions that the Bank of England may not have to raise interest rates quite as aggressively to temper the inflationary impact of Kwasi Kwarteng's 'mini-budget'. However, longer-dated Gilts weakened on the realization that the bulk of the £45 billion ($48 billion) tax cuts promised two weeks ago are still in place - and are still set to be funded exclusively through borrowing.3. U.S. stock to open with modest bounce; Tesla update weighsU.S. stock markets are set to open modestly higher after slumping to their lowest close of 2022 on Friday on continuing fears about a growth slowdown and its effects on corporate profits. The extent of that is likely to be only too visible in the upcoming earnings season.By 06:25 ET, Dow Jones futures were up 135 points, or 0.5%, while S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.1%.Nasdaq was underperforming due largely to disappointing third-quarter delivery numbers from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). It shipped only 343,830 vehicles in the three months through September, some 4% short of consensus expectations.Tesla warned that “it is becoming increasingly challenging to secure vehicle transportation capacity and at a reasonable cost” at the end of the quarter, when it typically increases deliveries.4. Credit Suisse slumps as CEO sets alarm bells ringingCredit Suisse (SIX:CSGN) stock slumped and the cost of insuring its debt against default exploded, as fears for its stability continued to swirl.Chief executive Ulrich Koerner, who is set to announce a major restructuring of the fallen Swiss giant later this month, had told staff on Friday that the bank is looking at “a number of strategic initiatives including potential divestitures and asset sales,"" with the aim of creating “a more focused, agile group with a significantly lower absolute cost base.""Credit Suisse’s recent high-profile failures in risk management – embodied by the blow-ups of Greensill Capital and Archegos Capital Management – have led markets to speculate that it may also be on the wrong end of big bets on interest rate derivatives, something that could prove highly expensive in the current environment, if true.5. IEA warns on gas supplies; Russian forces retreat from 'annexed' territoryRussia's troops abandoned more territory in eastern Ukraine at the weekend, only hours after President Vladimir Putin formally annexed them, as Ukrainian forces continued to make advances on the battlefield.Russian troops withdrew from the town of Lyman, surrendering a rail junction that is key to supplying troops further to the south and west of the country. That includes troops stationed west of the Dnieper river in the province of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces recaptured a string of settlements in a 25-kilometer advance on Sunday.The reverses have accentuated Russia's use of its gas supplies as an economic weapon: it cut off supplies to its second-largest European country, Italy, at the weekend, after election winner Giorgia Meloni failed to signal any weakening in Italy's support for Ukraine.Elsewhere, the International Energy Agency warned that gas markets face ""unprecedented"" uncertainty this winter and into 2023 as dwindling levels of key Russian supplies drive up prices and disrupt trade flows, especially if the European Union does not take steps to curb demand.Related ArticlesOPEC+ Output Cut, U.K. U-Turn, Credit Suisse, Tesla Woes - What's Moving MarketsGreek economic rebound to slow next year as energy costs curb growth- draft budgetKim Kardashian settles SEC crypto charge, to pay $1.26 million]"

22,d7bc9a0f-b374-3e57-9aae-fe9a3da6592d,MS,2022-10-03,Wall Street: The U.S. housing market to see the second biggest home price decline since the Great Depression,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-u-housing-market-093741575.html,1664789861,STORY,['MS'],"[National home price declines are uncommon, but it does occur on occasion. It happened in the early 1980s, then again in the early 1990s, and most notably in the years following the 2008 housing crash. That said, sharp home price declines are incredibly rare: Only the Great Depression and the Great Recession saw nationwide home prices fall in the double-digits range.That history—or lack of history—is why recent outlooks published by Wall Street titans are raising eyebrows. Not only is there a building consensus on Wall Street that we've entered into a period of falling home prices, but there's also a consensus it will be the second-sharpest home price decline since the Great Depression.Let's take a look at where financial giants expect U.S. home prices to head next.Morgan Stanley: U.S. home prices to fall 7%Last week, Morgan Stanley finally joined the housing bear crowd. Heading forward, the investment bank now expects U.S. home prices to fall 7% by the end of 2023. On one hand, that's far smaller than the 27% peak-to-trough decline the country experienced between 2006 and 2012. On the other hand, it's twice as large as the 3.1% peak-to-trough decline posted in the early ’90s. In fact, if Morgan Stanley's forecast comes to fruition, it would mark the second-sharpest drop since the Great Depression.The culprit? Spiking mortgage rates, coupled with unprecedented home price growth, has put affordability into the upper bounds of history.""If we assume a 7% mortgage rate, affordability looks materially worse than today. And the pace of its deceleration has already more than doubled compared to almost any time in history,"" writes Morgan Stanley researchers. ""The positive takeaway—which we think puts the magnitude of this [7% forecasted home price] drop into perspective—is that this decrease would only bring home prices back to where they were in January 2022. That is still 32% above where home prices were in March 2020.""Keep in mind that a 7% decline is Morgan Stanley's ""base case"" forecast. The investment bank also issued a ""bull case"" and a ""bear case."" If mortgage rates come back down to earth by next spring (i.e., Morgan Stanley's bull case), U.S. home prices could climb 5% in 2023. Conversely, if the country slips into a recession (i.e., Morgan Stanley's bear case), the national home price decline could exceed 10%.Story continues""Affordability is already challenged, exposing would-be homeowners to an increasing rent environment that erodes their ability to save for a down payment. If that were to be combined with increasing unemployment, we could imagine a scenario in which existing home sales continue to outpace the GFC to the downside,"" writes Morgan Stanley researchers, referring to the Global Financial Crisis.Goldman Sachs: U.S. home prices to fall 5% to 10%As weakening housing data trickled in this summer, Goldman Sachs affirmed its positive home price outlook for 2023. Well, that was until it caved last week.Peak-to-trough, Goldman Sachs now expects U.S. home prices to fall 5% to 10%. That's a sharp downward revision from last month, when the investment bank predicted that U.S. home prices would rise 1.8% in 2023.""We view the risks to these estimates as tilted to the downside because of a sharp deterioration in our descriptive home price outlook scores and evidence of strong mean reversion in regional data,"" write Goldman Sachs researchers.Simply put: Goldman Sachs acknowledges its 2023 outlook might still be on the conservative side.Moody’s Analytics: U.S. home prices to fall 5% to 10%Good mortgage underwriting. Plain vanilla lending. Record low vacancy rate. That's why Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi says we aren't heading for a 2008-style housing crash. However, Zandi says improved lending practices and tight housing supply won't be enough to prevent the ongoing home price correction. The fundamentals, he says, are simply too detached from reality.Peak-to-trough, Moody’s Analytics expects U.S. home prices to fall 5% to 10% even if a recession doesn't come to pass. If the country slips into an economic downturn, Moody’s Analytics predicts U.S. home prices would fall by 10% to 15%. Either way, Zandi says, it will likely take 12 to 18 months for prices to bottom out.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comWhen a group like Moody’s Analytics or Goldman Sachs says the ""U.S. housing market"" or ""U.S. home prices,"" they're talking about an aggregated view of the country. On a regional level, those results are going to vary. The ongoing home price correction won't be an exception.Every quarter, Moody’s Analytics assesses whether local fundamentals, including local income levels, can support local home values. If a regional housing market is “overvalued” by more than 25%, Moody’s Analytics deems it “significantly overvalued.” Through the second quarter of the year, 210 of the nation's 413 largest regional housing markets fell into the “significantly overvalued” camp.Heading forward, Moody's Analytics predicts that ""significantly overvalued"" housing markets should see home price declines between 10% and 15%. If a recession hits, Moody’s Analytics expects those home price declines to widen to 20% to 25% in “significantly overvalued” housing markets.Fitch Ratings: U.S. home prices could fall 10% to 15%A few weeks back, Fitch Ratings finally gave its housing outlook. The Big Three credit rating agency is clearly on the bearish side.“The likelihood of a severe downturn in U.S. housing has increased; however, our rating case scenario provides for a more moderate pullback that includes a mid-single-digit decline in housing activity in 2023, and further pressure in 2024,” wrote Fitch Ratings researchers on Tuesday. “Although we recently affirmed the ratings and Stable Outlooks for our U.S. homebuilder portfolio, ratings could face pressure under a more pronounced downturn scenario that would likely include housing activity falling roughly 30% or more over a multiyear period, and 10% to 15% declines in home prices.”Of course, if home prices actually drop 10% to 15%, Fortune might rebrand the Pandemic Housing Boom.

23,ad3f9ae2-d2a3-33e9-a17e-0b4d5ab4f8a5,CRM,2022-10-03,"Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 79%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-nyse-crm-favorite-120047715.html,1664712047,STORY,['CRM'],"[If you want to know who really controls Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 79% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Salesforce, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Salesforce?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Salesforce. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Salesforce's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Salesforce. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.9% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.9% of common stock, and FMR LLC holds about 4.7% of the company stock. Additionally, the company's CEO Marc Benioff directly holds 2.8% of the total shares outstanding.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of SalesforceWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Salesforce, Inc.. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$4.5b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Salesforce .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Technology companies are among the hardest hit, with the macro environment being generally unfavorable to most companies. That said, the whole “buy low, sell high” mantra can come into play for long-term investors. Thus, it’s probably shopping season for those looking for some fast-moving hypergrowth tech stocks to buy in this market.That’s because the innovation and long-term growth, driven by the software and semiconductor sectors specifically, isn’t likely to stop with higher interest rates and a slowing economy. Growth may slow, as will overall business investment. But over the long-term, the secular catalysts that have taken many world-class stocks higher will likely remain.Accordingly, for investors looking for quality hypergrowth tech stocks to buy that are growing fast (and will likely continue to grow rapidly in the future), here are three of my top picks to consider right now:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCRMSalesforce$147.47ADBEAdobe$278.49NVDANvidia$121.41Salesforce (CRM)A hand with pink painted fingernails holds a Salesforce sticker.Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.comSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) remains a top pick for many investors as one of the best hypergrowth tech stocks of the past decade. Despite being beaten up by the overall market and its tech peers, this is a company I think maybe getting to compelling levels here.That’s not only because of the company’s cloud-based software solutions. This is a company that focuses on customer relationship management technology. Indeed, when times get tough, Salesforce’s customers will not only seek out but require, Salesforce’s software solutions.In many cases, software companies can often provide products or services viewed as “nice to haves” by their clientele. That’s not the case with Salesforce. This company puts forward essential technology to streamline corporate business models, which most can’t go without.Story continuesSalesforce’s recent results have highlighted just how impressive the rapid adoption of the company’s cloud-based solutions has been. The company brought in revenue growth of 22% year-over-year, an impressive figure relative to its peers. Additionally, its forecast for future growth implies a compounded annual growth rate (or CAGR) of around 17%. It’s hard to find any such company with metrics like these, which is why this stock has the valuation multiple it does.Adobe (ADBE)Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.Source: Tattoboo / ShutterstockOne of the world’s largest software companies, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), is another key player in the fast-growing software space. Most of this company’s revenue comes through licensing fees from its customers. Unique products such as Adobe Acrobat, Photoshop, and Illustrator are just a few of this company’s offerings to creative folks everywhere.Like the overall market, ADBE stock has taken a beating this year. The stock is down nearly 50% this year alone. However, it can still bounce back.Experts forecast Adobe could grow its earnings at a 9% clip this year and 15% next year. Revenue projections are also inspiring, with most expecting double-digit CAGR numbers on the horizon. Thus, when growth predictions are quickly declining due to the Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening, Adobe is one company that is still likely to provide growth.As long as creative folks and the gig economy workers that are heavy users of Adobe’s products continue to stay engaged, I think this will likely be one of the top hypergrowth tech stocks to buy right now.Nvidia (NVDA)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.Source: ShutterstockOne of the oldest tech companies on this list is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Incorporated in 1993, this leading manufacturer of advanced microprocessors and hardware products is among the world’s most sought-after chip makers. That’s because, for any sort of complex computing task (think AI, machine learning, etc.) to be completed, Nvidia chips are generally the go-to option.Nvidia’s core business units comprise Professional Visualization, Gaming products, Data Centers, and Automotive. Gaming products and Data Centers make up over 70% of the company’s revenues.The recent bull market we all enjoyed was particularly profitable and viewed positively. That’s because gaming and data center growth would never end. People would permanently transition towards connecting with others online, with human connection (thanks to the pandemic) scarred in a way many thoughts were impossible.Alas, 2022 has brought about the return to the office for many companies, and as more folks shifted their focus from gaming (and crypto mining, which is included in this business unit), Nvidia’s stock has been hit hard.However, it’s clear that when the next bull market begins, NVDA stock will likely surge higher. This company benefits from the most secular growth catalysts and euphoric rises in sectors like gaming and crypto. That said, during bear market declines like these, investors can pick up shares of this fast-growing company on the cheap. That seems like a good idea for those thinking long-term.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after investigating Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Ralph Lauren is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$781m ÷ (US$7.0b - US$1.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).Thus, Ralph Lauren has an ROCE of 15%.  That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 15%. Check out our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren roceIn the above chart we have measured Ralph Lauren's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEOver the past five years, Ralph Lauren's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at Ralph Lauren in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that Ralph Lauren has been paying out a decent 36% of its earnings to shareholders. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Ralph Lauren's ROCEWe can conclude that in regards to Ralph Lauren's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 6.3% to shareholders over the last five years. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.Like most companies, Ralph Lauren does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.While Ralph Lauren isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

But truth be told, much of our lives are now already controlled online. In fact, initiatives to mix the digital world with reality using the Internet, and the ever-growing importance of Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality are expected to help the metaverse market grow by leaps and bounds in a decade or so.The metaverse market size, in reality, is estimated to reach $824.53 billion by 2030 from $27.21 billion in 2020. The market is expected to witness a CAGR of 39.1% from 2022 to 2030, according to Verified Market Research, citing a PRNewswire article.Lest we forget, the increase in demand for remote work amid the coronavirus outbreak worldwide has already helped the metaverse market to grow. At the same time, the growing acceptance of non-fungible tokens and cryptocurrencies has positively impacted this space.Astute investors should, thus, keep an eye on companies that are positioned to benefit from this growing metaverse market that is at the moment in its early stage.Anyhow, the broader market isn’t doing good, with the major indexes tumbling as the Fed turns hawkish to tame stubbornly high inflation. Thus, the growing metaverse market amid such a bloodbath in the stock market is surely encouraging news for investors.Some of the prominent companies whose growth will be propelled by metaverse are Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Roblox Corporation RBLX and Matterport, Inc. MTTR. These companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Microsoft’s business is somehow closely linked to the metaverse.

Due to their inability to keep up with the demand, the family had to restart the business three times.​​“We weren’t selling on the street anymore because we were in about 50-55 stores in Chicago and surrounding suburbs between 2015 to 2017,” said Genesis.“But we couldn’t keep up with demand again. I knew we had a great product people wanted to buy, but we didn’t have the back-end infrastructure for manufacturing and distribution that we needed, so I had to shut it down again.”Genesis relaunched Lorenzo’s business for the third time in 2020 during the COVID pandemic. With Walgreens’ Top Shelf program, Genesis received the support she needed to improve the first two launches with Lorenzo’s Frozen Pudding. The program provided access to capital vital for growth, connected her to a co-packer for manufacturing, and ultimately gave her distribution at Walgreens. The three-store pilot has since grown to more than 30 stores one year later.Lack of resources stymies Black entrepreneurs, but Walgreens is aiming to help reverse that trend by creating equitable opportunities for diverse businesses. As a result, Walgreens launched Shelf Life, a new web series showcasing its diverse suppliers and how they made it onto the retailer’s shelves.Through its Shelf Life series, Walgreens is shining light on underrepresented entrepreneurs on the path to growth. Additionally, Walgreens is changing the way we do business while changing the lives of business owners like Lorenzo and GenesisStory continuesToday, the duo’s vision emphasizes the importance of growing not only their business but generational wealth as well. Shelf Life is sharing stories of change and transformation, and these stories are not only instructive but incredibly inspirational too.Learn more about their story here https://news.walgreens.com/our-stories/a-top-shelf-business.htm.This article first appeared on Blacknews.com.]"
30,111661ac-9b49-374c-bb74-f2284e3d8789,SBUX,2022-10-03,Starbucks' (NASDAQ:SBUX) Dividend Will Be Increased To $0.53,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-nasdaq-sbux-dividend-increased-145843798.html,1664722723,STORY,['SBUX'],"[Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 25th of November to $0.53. This will take the annual payment to 2.5% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. View our latest analysis for Starbucks Starbucks' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Starbucks was quite comfortably covering its dividend with earnings and it was paying more than 75% of its free cash flow to shareholders. By paying out so much of its cash flows, this could indicate that the company has limited opportunities for investment and growth.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 21.5%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 52% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendStarbucks Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $0.34, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.12. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 20% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Starbucks has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 13% per annum. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders.Our Thoughts On Starbucks' DividendOverall, this is a reasonable dividend, and it being raised is an added bonus. On the plus side, the dividend looks sustainable by most measures but it is let down by the lack of cash flows. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. To that end, Starbucks has 3 warning signs (and 2 which are concerning) we think you should know about. Is Starbucks not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

With 85% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$36b last week after a 5.6% drop in the share price. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 11% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Sysco, which might have negative implications on individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Sysco. View our latest analysis for Sysco ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sysco?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Sysco already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Sysco's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Sysco. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.8% and 6.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of SyscoThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Sysco Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$61m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Sysco. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Sysco better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Sysco that you should be aware of before investing here.Ultimately the future is most important.

While these 70 projects won’t give investors an answer regarding The 7 Best Agriculture Stocks to Buy Now, it does reinforce why the agriculture industry is a smart bet for future growth.The 70 projects in this first funding pool include the following:Climate-Smart Agriculture Innovative Finance InitiativeScaling Methane Emissions Reductions and Soil Carbon SequestrationThe Soil Inventory Project Partnership for Impact and DemandThe Grass is Greener on the Other Side: Developing Climate-Smart Beef and Bison Commodities, andTraceable Reforestation for America’s Carbon and TimberAll 70 projects aim to help farmers, academics, agriculture-related companies, and government agencies work together to produce a more efficient, innovative, and climate-friendly industry. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe seven agriculture stocks to buy should all benefit from the investment the Biden Administration and the USDA are making in smart farming. While it will take years to assess the success of these projects, you can invest in these seven agriculture stocks today. ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$84.07CTVACorteva$58.27DEDeere &amp; Co.$342.55TSCOTractor Supply$192.45AGMFederal Agricultural Mortgage$102.46TSNTyson Foods$68.81SMGScotts Miracle-Gro$48.38Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)a picture of farmland during the daytimeSource: ShutterstockThe Des Moines Register reported in mid-September that Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) CEO Juan Luciano made $14.8 million by selling 284,531 shares of the world’s leading producer of human and animal nutrition company.At the time, Luciano exercised options between $33.18 and $40.65 on Sep. 9, netting an extra $2 million on his stock options because the ADM share price had fallen by 12% since. The sale was part of Luciano’s Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. It’s not an indication that he knows something bad about the company. Instead, CEOs, like Luciano have financial obligations requiring them to sell shares for cash. Story continuesAs a company, Archer-Daniels-Midland continues to innovate for the future. On Aug. 17, for example, it announced it was collaborating with New Culture, a company that makes animal-free cheese products that look and feel like the real thing. The partnership gives New Culture the scale necessary to make an indent in the animal-free dairy products industry. Meanwhile, ADM gains access to one of the industry’s most innovative developers of animal-free dairy products. It doesn’t hurt that ADM generates a trailing 12-month operating income of $3.82 billion from $94.36 billion in revenue. ADM is a major player in agriculture. Corteva (CTVA)Closeup Of Small green Agricultural Toy Tractor loading money coins, Icon Farmer Machinery, Agriculture Business Concept (Harvest Finance)Source: Max_555 / Shutterstock.comAgriculture stocks are performing well in 2022. The iShares Global Agriculture Index ETF — listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as COW– is up nearly 2% year-to-date, almost 26% better than the S&amp;P 500. Not surprisingly, Corteva (NYSE:CTVA) is up more than 22% YTD. In March 2021, I suggested Corteva was one of seven safe stocks that wouldn’t bleed your portfolio. I liked the stock because I believed Corteva would do well in 2021 and beyond. After all, agriculture is wise place to put your money. This was despite the threat from activist investor Starboard Value to shake things up. Starboard advocated for the dismissal of CEO Jim Collins in early 2021. While they didn’t get their wish, they did get three of their proposed independent board members added to Corteva’s board in March 2021 as part of the activist investor’s agreement with the company. All three are still on the board. Starboard continues to own more than one million shares of CTVA stock. Of the 25 analysts covering its stock, 17 rate it Buy or Overweight, with a median target price of $70, 22% higher than its current share price. Deere &amp; Co. (DE)Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.Source: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.comIn August 2019, I identified 10 companies using artificial intelligence (AI) to grow their businesses. Deere &amp; Co. (NYSE:DE) was one of the names on my list. “However, starting in 2013, Deere began to plot a vision of the future farm where all the machinery would be autonomously operated with the farmer monitoring everything from his home” I wrote. “Since then, it has evolved to include AI, computer vision, and machine learning. Agriculture is surprisingly well-suited to technology despite its low-tech reputation.”Using AI to save its customers money, Deere was betting farmers would buy newer equipment. Deere stock is up more than 128% since then.Many have a problem with John Deere’s dominance of the farm equipment market and how it got that way, but that’s a story for another day. There’s no denying the company’s size and scale. It is the largest farm equipment company in the world after all. In addition, it also sells more equipment globally than the next two largest competitors combined. It controls 53% of the U.S. market for large tractors and 60% of the U.S. combine market.Its TTM revenue through Q3 2023 is $47.93 billion, with an operating profit of $7.75 billion. That’s an operating margin of 16.2%. CNH Industrial’s (NYSE:CNHI) is 11.4%, 480 basis points lower. Tractor Supply (TSCO)IDEX stock: An electric tractor sits in a field on a sunny day with a wind turbine in the background.Source: Matthew Troke / Shutterstock.comI mentioned the iShares Global Agriculture Index ETF in the Corteva section. One of its top 10 holdings is Tennessee-based specialty retailer Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO), the largest retail farm and ranch store operator in the U.S. However, it targets recreational farmers, not the kind John Deere supplies.I first recommended TSCO for InvestorPlace in September 2014. It was one of 3 Great Stocks to Buy With No Debt and Great Prospects. It’s up 209% in the eight years since 2.5x the S&amp;P 500. Charlie Bilello recently pointed out that TSCO was the third best-performing S&amp;P 500 stock over the past 20 years, up 35,087%.While I don’t know if it can keep up such a blistering pace, it continues to deliver beneficial results. That is, even though, over those 20 years, there’s been at least four different CEOs and two recessions.The current CEO, Hal Lawton was hired away from Macy’s (NYSE:M) in December 2019. Since then, its shares have nearly doubled. In July, Tractor Supply reported Q2 2022 results that included a 5.5% increase in same-store sales and a 10.7% increase in earnings per share. In addition, it raised its 2022 outlook. On the top line, it now expects at least $13.95 billion in revenue, up from its previous guidance of $13.6 billion. On the bottom line, it now expects EPS of at least $9.48, 28 cents higher than its previous guidance.Down 20% YTD, it currently trades at 1.6x sales, right at its five-year average, so it’s not overpriced.Federal Agricultural Mortgage (AGM)Man calculating finances on calculator. Finance. Finance stocks.Source: wutzkohphoto / ShutterstockAffectionately known as Farmer Mac, the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp. (NYSE:AGM) provides low-cost financing to agricultural lenders and those participating in agribusiness. A few highlights from its Q2 2022 presentation suggest it’s an excellent stock to own for the long haul. For example, more than 90% of its revenue is recurring, a figure tech companies would die for. On a cumulative basis, just 0.11% of its Agricultural Finance Mortgage Loans have soured. Lastly, its business continues to grow. Between 2000 and 2021, its outstanding business volume achieved a compound annual growth rate of 10%.Recurring revenue multiplied by rock-solid growth is a recipe for success. I guess that’s why AGM stock’s gained 3,200% since the March 2009 lows during the financial crisis.On page 7 of its presentation, Farmer Mac points out that it has just 6% of the farm sector real estate debt of $302 billion. The mortgage market is a big one, and it intends to keep gobbling up more of it in the years to come. In August, it reported its Q2 2022 results that included adding $1.9 billion of gross business volume ($236 million net growth), a 12% sequential increase in net interest income to $69.4 million, and a core EPS of $2.83, 19% higher sequentially and 2% year-over-year.Yielding 3.71%, get paid to wait for the stock’s next leg up. Tyson Foods (TSN)A package of Tyson Foods (TSN) chicken breasts.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comThe processor of chicken, beef and pork has not done well by shareholders over the past five years. Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) stock is down nearly 3%, more than 47 percentage points worse than the S&amp;P 500.So, why am I including TSN on my list? If nothing else, reversion to the mean suggests Tyson is due for a relief rally. Tyson recently made some organizational changes that will help the company grow. Included in the moves was the announcement that fourth-generation Tyson family member John R. Tyson is the company’s new Chief Financial Officer. Current CFO Stewart Glendinning moves over to Group President, Prepared Foods. The company hopes Glendinning’s financial and operational background will help its Prepared Foods business come into its own — they currently account for 18.1% of revenue and 17.4% of operating income — while John Tyson appears to be in the running to become CEO in the future.Analysts are lukewarm about its stock. Of the 15 covering it, 10 rate it a Hold. However, the average target price is $92.72, 35% higher than where it’s currently trading.Tyson expects 2022 revenues of $53 billion at the midpoint of its guidance. At an operating margin of 9%, it should generate $4.8 billion in operating income for the year.If you’re an income investor, it has an above-average yield of 2.7%, has grown the annual dividend for 10 consecutive years, and averaged a 17.2% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. It’s an excellent stock to own in turbulent times.Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG)A photo of various raw vegetables.Source: monticello/ShutterStock.comIf you bought Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE:SMG) stock at the beginning of 2022, I feel your pain. It’s down more than 70% YTD, and there are still three months left of the year.I would put SMG on your watchlist if you’re an aggressive investor. It hasn’t traded this low since June 2013. If you bought back then and didn’t sell at its all-time high of $180.43 in April 2021, I feel your pain times two.The company’s shares lost 25% in August alone as margins crumbled as retailers reduced inventory levels.However, weighing more heavily on the share price could be the implosion of its Hawthorne Gardening business. Sales fell 63% in Q3 2022 to $154.5 million from $421.9 million a year earlier. Through the third quarter, Hawthorne’s sales were down 50% due to oversupply issues. As a result, it took a $632.4 million impairment charge on its goodwill and intangible assets.To counter the slide, the company announced Project Springboard when it released its third-quarter results in early August. It is intended to return Scotts Miracle-Gro to the level of profitability that shareholders have become accustomed to. Over the past five years, the company’s average gross margin was 32.1%. In Q3 2022, it was 19.9% and 27.5% YTD. It trades at o.67x sales, one-third of its five-year average. SMG is the value play of these seven agricultural stocks. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The company's market valuation decreased by US$14b after the stock price dropped 9.6% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.

While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$83.01). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Insiders in Philip Morris International didn't buy any shares in the last year.

It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Philip Morris International insider transactions don't fill us with confidence.

36,ec027af6-d16a-39e7-8ed8-df05883a86cb,SPG,2022-10-03,7 Real Estate Stocks to Sell Before They Die,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-real-estate-stocks-sell-210106656.html,1664485266,STORY,"['GNL', 'IIPR', 'MPW', 'MAC', 'SPG']","[It’s been a tumultous couple of years of real estate stocks. The pandemic caused unprecedented changes in people’s daily lives and working habits. Some categories of real estate investment trusts (REITs) benefitted from these adjustments. Sub-sectors such as data centers and industrial warehouses enjoyed a surge in demand during the pandemic period.Many categories of real estate, however, did not fare so well. One category that has taken a great deal of heat is malls and shopping centers. The past two years have seen a tremendous move toward e-commerce instead of brick and mortar retail. Offices are another category of real estate stocks facing problems. Workers are returning to the office little by little. But telecommuting is here to stay for many roles, and still more firms are adopting hybrid work models that require less-expensive office space. Office REITs are struggling to adapt to this change.It’s not just offices and shopping mall real estate stocks that are struggling, either. The huge rise in interest rates and change in credit market conditions are creating problems for several other REIT subsectors. Investors should be particularly careful with these seven real estate stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSPGSimon Property Group$89.13MACMacerich$7.99IIPRInnovative Industrial Properties$88.09GNLGlobal Net Lease$10.31OPIOffice Properties Trust$13.54SKTTanger Factory Outlets$13.59MPWMedical Properties Trust$11.44Simon Property Group (SPG)building facade of simon property group (SPG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA niche has developed on YouTube of folks videoing old malls in various states of decline. They range from malls that are still in operation with mostly empty hallways, to completely closed and abandoned ones. People have taken to viewing these “dead mall” videos, sometimes nostalgically, to remember a time when these buildings were still centers of commerce and social activity.Not all malls are dead malls, of course. But an increasing number are. A 2020 report suggested that 25% of America’s remaining 1,000 malls would shutter within the next 3-5 years. The collapse of formerly key department stores such as Sears and JC Penney has hastened this decline as malls are left without the anchor tenants these companies once provided.Story continuesSimon Property (NYSE:SPG) has some of the nation’s best malls. It has also been aggressive in diversifying into outlets and foreign real estate. Still, this company is fighting the inexorable decline of its core asset group. Simon made it through the pandemic in one piece, but the long-term outlook is cloudy at best. And given current inflation and the possibility of an economic slowdown, both shoppers and retailers may be in a tough spot this holiday season.Macerich (MAC)a person standing in a shopping mall with a bag in their hand. May CPI data.Source: ShutterstockMacerich (NYSE:MAC) is another shopping mall REIT. The company has traditionally focused on high-end shopping malls. This trust’s focus on luxury has insulated its malls, to an extent. While the middle class mall of old anchored by JC Penney and Sears is not a viable model nowadays, high-end malls are still hanging on.Unfortunately for real estate stocks in this space, massive capital costs are required to build and maintain its luxury malls. While business is still okay at Macerich’s properties, rents simply haven’t gone up fast enough to provide much profit. In the late 2010s, MAC stock had already plunged from $50 to $20 as investors noted the darkening outlook for the company.The pandemic accelerated this trend; MAC stock fell to $6 in 2020 and the company’s dividend was slashed. It’s easy to blame Covid-19 for the company’s problems. But the truth is that Macerich has a ton of debt and would have had a challenging future regardless. Between the lingering effects of the past two years and now sharply higher interest rates and a weakening economic situation, Macerich shares seem destined to slump below their prior lows.Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)stocks to buy: warehouse interior with shelves, pallets and boxes DSource: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.comInnovative Industrial Properties (NASDAQ:IIPR) is a specialty REIT focused on cannabis. Specifically, Innovative Industrial buys greenhouses and cannabis cultivation properties ,and then rents them out to marijuana growers.Originally, this was a great business model due to a specific quirk. Cannabis remains illegal on a federal level, and thus banks typically won’t lend to marijuana companies. This lack of capital can make it prohibitive for cannabis companies to finance their production facilites.Innovative Industrial came up with the solution. It raised funds from investors and then uses those to finance the cultivation companies. At first, Innovative Industrial was the only game in town and earned massive returns on its invested capital. However, competition has surged into the arena as more REITs and specialty lenders go after the same market.Meanwhile, some of Innovative’s tenants are running into trouble. The downside of earning 20% on your capital, after, all, is that the tenant may not be able to afford such punitive rents. Major tenant King’s Garden defaulted earlier this summer, sending IIPR stock down double digits. More tenants appear to be a on a weak financial footing. And to add to the headache, if and when marijuana is legalized nationally, banks will be able to lend to cannabis farmers directly, making Innovative’s future much less certain.Global Net Lease (GNL)A paper cutout of a house is attached to a tag reading ""for rent.""Source: Pixelbliss / Shutterstock.comGlobal Net Lease (NYSE:GNL) is a REIT focused on net lease properties in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Triple net lease is a type of real estate transaction that involves leading a building to a tenant, where the tenant covers major operating expenses.Triple net leases are historically a solid-performing category of the REIT category. Accordingly, many investors like Global Net Lease’s business model overall. However, the firm has always struggled to achieve the same level of success as rivals such as Realty Income (NYSE:O). Thanks to this, Global Net Lease has a high cost of capital, meaning it has to pay more to get funds from investors for new properties.This has led to Global Net Lease diluting its shareholder base considerably while offering an unusually high dividend yield. This worked out alright prior to 2020, but now the firm’s weaker balance sheet is catching up to it. The firm’s European exposure is largely in the United Kingdom. There, a fiscal crisis has sent the value of the British Pound plummeting and will impact Global Net Lease’s revenues from that market. Right now, GNL stock is yielding 14%. Investors might think that’s a great deal. But, more likely, Global Net will not be able to maintain its current payout, and thus will have to reduce its dividend.Office Properties Trust (OPI)Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room.Source: GaudiLab / ShutterstockOffice Properties Trust (NASDAQ:OPI) is one of the smaller struggling real estate stocks which, like Global Net Lease, seems likely to cut its dividend going forward. Office Properties Trust shares currently offer an eye-popping 15% dividend yield. That might seem like a great offer for retirees and income-seeking investors.However, Office Properties Trust gets its income from offices. It doesn’t own the top offices in a given market, either. It owns cheaper properties that historically attracted significant interest from tenants looking for a more affordable office lease.Now, however, companies can pick whatever office they want for new leases, given the low occupancy rates across the industry. Long story short, unless you own the newest, most modern, and most glamorous offices in a market, it’s going to be rough sailing getting new tenants. Investors buying OPI stock for the 15% yield are looking at the past, when Office Properties Trust had a stable business outlook. Now, however, the company will likely have to accept much lower rates for its buildings going forward, leading to a major dividend cut.Tanger Factory Outlets (SKT)Tanger Outlets (SKT) sign over a buildingSource: Ritu Manoj Jethani / Shutterstock.comTanger Factory Outlets (NYSE:SKT) is a shopping center REIT focused on outlets. The outlet center model was a great template for real estate stocks 20 years ago. Operators such as Tanger or Simon would build a major shopping destination in a tourist area or along a major highway in between two big cities. People would go to the outlet center and get bargains that weren’t available at shopping malls or in downtown shopping areas. The thinking was that outlets gave retailers an alternative venue to clear out certain kinds of products, while giving shoppers a fun and novel bargain-hunting experience.It’s far from certain that outlets make much sense in 2022, however. The internet has made it easy to go bargain-shopping without ever leaving your home. Meanwhile, discount retailers like Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) set up shop within major cities, making it possible to get the experience without having to drive to a far-away outlet center.Tanger remains focused on its outlet business and hasn’t made serious efforts to pivot the business. Like Macerich, Tanger’s financial results were poor prior to the pandemic with the company consistently reporting flat-to-slightly-down financial results in the late 2010s. Now, things have gone from bad to worse for the REIT in the post-2020 landscape. Tanger may hang on for a little while longer, but the long-term prognosis for both Tanger and the outlet shopping experience seem grim.Medical Properties Trust (MPW)Blurred hospital images, Patient bed in the hospital, Hospital cleaning, Hospital disinfection cleaning, Patient bed cleaning for emergency patients. Medical Properties Trust (MPW)Source: venusvi / Shutterstock.comMedical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW) is a REIT focused on ownership of hospitals. The firm has gone on a tremendous buying spree, acquiring hospitals left and right. Unfortunately, it has run into trouble as its largest tenant, Steward Health Care Systems, has lost $800 million in recent years. Medical Properties Trust has seemingly had to step in and lend large sums of money to Steward and its CEO directly to keep the struggling hospital system going. As Steward made up 30% of Medical Properties Trust’s revenues in 2020, any default here could be devastating.Short sellers have been hounding MPW stock all year, and with good reason. Shares continue to slide, and the trust’s now-9% dividend yield seems increasingly tenuous.Adding to the above point, there has been huge trading in put options on Medical Properties Trust, specifically for its October 2021 options expiry. On one day alone, last week, more than 40,000 put options changed hands. This is tremendous volume for a small and relatively under-the-radar REIT, suggesting that someone is making a big bet on bad news about a tenant or possible dividend cut in the near future.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

37,c912b998-5148-3f2c-bf0d-a17f289b5685,HCA,2022-10-03,"Is It Time To Consider Buying HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-consider-buying-hca-healthcare-113810675.html,1664797090,STORY,['HCA'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine HCA Healthcare’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare What Is HCA Healthcare Worth?Good news, investors! HCA Healthcare is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that HCA Healthcare’s ratio of 8.1x is below its peer average of 18.98x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Healthcare industry. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because HCA Healthcare’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of HCA Healthcare look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of HCA Healthcare, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -4.3%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although HCA is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. I recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to HCA, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on HCA for some time, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current price multiple, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.If you'd like to know more about HCA Healthcare as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

38,1eed6222-259d-3222-ac65-e15a0f92729a,GS,2022-10-03,The 7 Best Sleeper Stocks to Buy Before Wall Street Wakes Up,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-sleeper-stocks-buy-200404226.html,1664481844,STORY,"['AMD', 'F', 'DIS', 'GSBD', 'NKE', 'CRWD', 'GOOGL']","[This market downturn is leading many investors to throw the baby out with the bath water. The stampede into cash has investors sleeping on many great stocks that are sitting at 52-week lows and available to buy at rock-bottom prices. Many amazing companies have seen their stocks dragged lower in the current bear market despite the fact that their earnings have held up , while they continue to grow their businesses.  Companies are crushing earnings, issuing bullish forward guidance, increasing their share buybacks, and then seeing their stock price fall 5% or more. As a result, there are many sleeper stocks to buy before Wall Street wakes up.Rather than worry, investors should take the opportunity to buy the stocks of exceptional companies now while prices are low and plan to sell the shares high when markets recover. Here are seven of the best sleeper stocks to buy before Wall Street wakes up.AMDAMD$64NKENike$83.77GOOGLAlphabet$96.43DISDisney$95.50FFord$11.27CRWDCrowdstrike$167GSGoldman Sachs$295InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)Image of the Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) logo outside of a corporate buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAt $65 a share, semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock looks as though it has been left for dead. Not only are the shares near a 52-week low, but they’ve fallen 60% from their 52-week high of $164.46 per share.The steady erosion in the stock price completely ignores the fact that, despite the many challenges it has faced this year. AMD is killing it in the semiconductor space, continuing to post strong earnings and taking market share from its competitors such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).For the second quarter, AMD reported earnings per share of $1.05 versus analysts’ average estimate of $1.03, according to Refinitiv data. The company’s revenue also beat mean expectations, coming in at $6.55 billion versus the average estimate of $6.53 billion.AMD’s Q2 revenue was up 70% from a year earlier. All four of AMD’s business units grew during the April through June period. But despite the stellar results, investors seem to be looking past AMD for some inexplicable reason. Oh, and the company also repurchased nearly $1 billion of its own stock during Q2.Story continuesNike (NKE)Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocksSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comThe last two days have brought more pain for the shareholders of sneaker and sports apparel company Nike (NYSE:NKE). After announcing that its inventory ballooned in its fiscal first quarter and that it would discount merchandise and offer promotions to lower its inventory, NKE stock fell more than 10% on September 30, dragging the share price down to a fresh 52-week low of $82.50.Nike’s stock has now fallen 49% this year with no bottom seemingly in sight after the inventory warning spooked investors. The share price has steadily declined with the stock market since November of last year.The irony is that despite its inventory challenges, Nike actually beat analysts’ average expectations for its fiscal Q1 earnings. Specifically, NKE announced earnings per share of 93 cents compared to the 92 cents that analysts, on average, had expected. Its revenue came in at $12.69 billion versus the mean outlook of $12.27 billion.The Oregon-based company continues to make progress in its transition to selling its sneakers and other products directly to customers rather than relying on third-party retailers. Plus, this past spring, Nike’s board of directors authorized a new four-year stock buyback program worth $18 billion.Alphabet (GOOGL)GOOG stock: letters spelling out googleSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.comBelieve it or not, you can now buy the shares of Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for less than $100. A 20-for-1 stock split in July of this year brought the share price down from around $1,800 to $120. But since the split, the share price has continued to slide lower. As a result, GOOGL stock is today changing hands at $98, which is not far from its 52-week low of $96. The shares of the technology giant are about 35% below their 52-week high.However, unlike AMD and Nike, Alphabet’s decline is somewhat self-inflicted. In late July, Alphabet reported a rare earnings miss that rattled investors’ confidence in the company.Specifically, Alphabet announced earnings per share of $1.21, while Wall Street was expecting $1.28. The disappointing results were mostly due to a decline in online advertising revenue, particularly at YouTube, which Alphabet owns.However, Alphabet’s advertising revenue will rebound when inflation subsides and the economic outlook improves. Over the long-term, GOOGL stock is still a good name to own. And it’s currently available at fire-sale prices.Disney (DIS)an image of mickey mouse on a yellow background to represent disney (DIS)Source: ilikeyellow / Shutterstock.comAre things really that bad for Disney (NYSE:DIS)? One would assume so after looking at the company’s stock.At $96 a share, DIS stock is nearly 50% below its 52-week high of $179.63. While it is true that the growth of the company’s Disney+ streaming service has slowed from the red-hot pace seen during the pandemic, its subscriptions reached 152.1 million during its most recent reported quarter. That was higher than the 147 million subscribers that analysts, on average, had expected. Also, Disney’s movies are back in theaters, and its theme parks and cruise ships are now fully operational for the first time in more than two years.Disney also recently reported that it has more than 221 million streaming subscribers across its Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ platforms. That combined total enabled Disney to surpass industry leader Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which has a total of 220 million subscribers, to become the new undisputed streaming champion.All of this helps to explain why Disney’s most recent financial results obliterated analysts’ average  forecasts. Specifically, it posted earnings per share of $1.09 versus the mean estimate of 96 cents. This is one sleeper stock that investors should start paying attention to.Ford Motor Co. (F)Ford logo badge on grill of carSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comThe shares of iconic U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) are down 47% this year and are fast approaching $10 a share. The shares are woefully undervalued and dirt cheap as their current price-earnings ratio is a very low 4.And the stock offers shareholders a healthy quarterly dividend that yields 4.87%. Yet despite all this, F stock continues to be shunned by both Wall Street and Main Street. The reasons for that range from fears over the company’s waning sales, parts shortages, excess inventory levels and a potential recession. But for long-term investors, it would be wrong to ignore the company that Henry Ford built.Short-term thinking is not factoring in the huge strides that Ford is making in electrifying its fleet of vehicles. In the last week alone, Ford announced that it was investing $700 million in and adding 500 jobs at its manufacturing plant in Kentucky. In all, Ford is investing $11.4 billion to build an electric F-150 assembly plant and three battery plants in Kentucky and Tennessee, creating more than 5,000 jobs in the process.It’s all part of Ford’s efforts to catch and surpass its rival, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), as the world’s leading EV maker. Investors might want to take a position in F stock before the company pulls into the lead in the global EV race.CrowdStrike (CRWD)A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logoSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.comCybersecurity is only getting more important as the world faces a growing number of online threats. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as high-profile attacks on companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), has only heightened the need for governments and companies to guard against cyber criminals. This fact should put leading cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) front-and-center in the minds of investors.But that hasn’t been the case in the last year. Over the past 12 months, CRWD stock has fallen 30% to $168 a share, and is now 44% below its 52-week high of $298.48.Despite the weakness of its shares and the current macroeconomic challenges it’s facing, CrowdStrike has continued to grow its business and analysts continue to upgrade their ratings on the stock. The Texas-based company most recently reported earnings of 36 cents a share on revenue of $535.2 million.That was much better than the EPS of 28 cents and the revenue of $516 million that Wall Street analysts, on average, had anticipated, according to data from FactSet. The company’s revenue grew nearly 60% versus the same quarter a year earlier.CrowdStrike is also one of the few tech companies in the U.S. that is continuing to hire right now.Goldman Sachs (GS)In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the backgroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is the leading investment bank in the U.S. As a result, the company finds ways to make money in any type of market. If you were looking to bet on a financial institution to keep its profits flowing during a market meltdown and and economic recession, you should bet on Goldman Sachs.This is, after all, a company whose employees, junior and senior, routinely work 100 hours a week, proving that money really doesn’t sleep. One case in point: Goldman just established a new private-equity fund worth $9.7 billion, its largest since 2007. This came amidst the worst market downturn since the 2008-09 financial crisis.But despite its pedigree as a deal and profit machine, Goldman Sachs’ stock is getting scant love from investors these days. In 2022, GS stock is down 26% and it’s trading at $294 a share.The bank’s stock hasn’t been this low since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet all signs suggest that Goldman will be able to emerge from the current market turmoil unscathed.While the growth of its revenue from deals such as mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings might have slowed, it is expanding its consumer banking business and earning more on loans as interest rates rise. Let’s see if investors will continue to ignore GS stock once the good times return to Wall Street.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in MSFT, GOOGL and DIS.

39,b614bba9-1865-32c9-bba3-ae2c8d35ed0b,NTRS,2022-10-03,"Northern Trust Corporation's (NASDAQ:NTRS) recent 3.3% pullback adds to one-year year losses, institutional owners may take drastic measures",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northern-trust-corporations-nasdaq-ntrs-110438994.html,1664795078,STORY,['NTRS'],"[Every investor in Northern Trust Corporation (NASDAQ:NTRS) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 86% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 3.3% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 20% for shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Northern Trust, which might have negative implications on individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Northern Trust. View our latest analysis for Northern Trust ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Northern Trust?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Northern Trust. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Northern Trust's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Northern Trust. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.6% and 4.6% of the stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 14 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Northern TrustThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.We can see that insiders own shares in Northern Trust Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$204m. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in Northern Trust. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Northern Trust better, we need to consider many other factors.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Chairman, President and CEO Steve MacMillan will ring the Nasdaq opening bell today to mark the beginning of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. This is the 16th time that Hologic (Nasdaq: HOLX), an innovative medical technology company and the pioneer of 3D mammography, will ring the bell to raise awareness about breast cancer.MacMillan will be joined by Hologic employees and members of the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA), including tennis legend and breast cancer survivor Martina Navratilova and WTA President Micky Lawler, as part of a multi-year partnership between Hologic and the WTA to champion women’s health and equality.""We are honored to stand alongside the women of the WTA in recognizing Breast Cancer Awareness Month as we continue to underscore the importance of preventive care and annual mammography screening,"" said MacMillan. ""Our recently released findings from the second year of the Hologic Global Women’s Health Index highlight the unfortunate reality that more than 2 billion women worldwide weren’t tested for any type of cancer, including breast cancer, in the past 12 months, making the work we do to increase awareness even more important.""The Hologic Global Women’s Health Index, one of the world’s largest studies on women’s well-being, examines critical markers for health by country and territory, and over time. It identifies barriers to preventive care for women and provides a framework for governments, business leaders, nonprofit organizations, scholars and others to achieve progress.""As a woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer after a routine mammogram, I know firsthand how important breast cancer screening is,"" said Navratilova. ""While progress has been made, Hologic’s research shows that far too many women are not getting the screenings they deserve. I’m proud to stand with Hologic this Breast Cancer Awareness Month and share my story in hopes of encouraging other women to schedule their mammograms and prioritize their health.""Story continuesThe bell ringing is one of many activities that Hologic and the WTA have used to spread the message of prevention, early detection and early treatment since the groundbreaking partnership began in March of this year. Throughout Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the two organizations will continue to bring much-needed attention to the critical issue of women’s health during tournaments, at special events and through public campaigns.About HologicHologic, Inc. is an innovative medical technology company primarily focused on improving women’s health and well-being through early detection and treatment.

KO, General Dynamics Corp. GD, AstraZeneca plc AZN, Boise Cascade BCC and Insperity Inc. NSP.5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Beat Market VolatilityThe year 2022 has been roiled by huge volatility and uncertainty, which have raised the appeal of dividend investing. Dividend stocks are major sources of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk even though these do not offer dramatic price appreciation.In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — The Coca-Cola Co., General Dynamics Corp., AstraZeneca plc, Boise Cascade and Insperity Inc. — that could be compelling picks amid market volatility.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation than simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Story continuesHere are the five of the 17 stocks that fit the bill:Georgia-based Coca-Cola, a beverage company, manufactures, markets, and sells various nonalcoholic beverages worldwide.

The line's first phase will begin construction later this year using state funds.Negotiators on the second-phase project are exploring financing using ""early purchases of (transportation) capacity,"" Neuquen province's Energy and Natural Resources Minister Alejandro Monteiro said this week on the sidelines of a Houston energy conference.The federal government is responsible for securing another portion of the line's financing, he added, possibly through loans or bonds.Companies involved in the talks include YPF, Tecpetrol, Pluspetrol, Exxon Mobil, Pan American Energy, Pampa Energia, Wintershall Dea and TotalEnergies , the minister said.The line's first phase initially will carry 11 million cubic meters per day (mmcmd) starting in 2023, expanding to 22 mmcmd in early 2024.State company IEASA has ordered the engineering design for the second phase, hoping to begin construction in 2024 and put it into service a year later, Monteiro added.""For them (gas producers), the construction of that infrastructure is a condition to accelerate output,"" he said. ""There is interest in building it as fast as possible.""IMPORTER TO EXPORTERBy the time a contract to buy Bolivian gas expires in 2026, Argentina expects to have solved its transportation issues to replace those imports with fuel from Neuquen, which is being produced at half the price Argentina pays for Bolivian gas.Story continues""It makes no sense that Argentina continues importing gas at $8-9 (per million BTU) if it can produce it at $4 (per million BTU),"" he said.Argentina also wants to expand gas sales to Chile. It will begin exports in October of a fixed seasonal volume of 10 mmcmd through April to that nation, and aims to sign a supply contract with Uruguay to regularize exports of another 200,000-300,000 cmd.Its goal is gaining energy self-sufficiency and overturning a trade deficit that costs Argentina billions of dollars per year, especially in liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports.An energy industry bill is expected soon to be submitted to Congress to regulate companies' access to hard currency as part of the country's foreign exchange system, while securing stability for export permits and a framework for LNG projects, according to Monteiro.YPF and Malaysia's Petronas signed an early agreement in September over unconventional gas output, transportation and LNG, their second attempt at an alliance.""There is a 12-month deadline to green light that LNG project. The idea is to have the legal framework ready by then,"" the minister said.A separate legislation also plans to encourage investment in lithium, hydrogen and other forms of green energy in Argentina.

Russian President Vladimir Putin last week blamed the United States and its allies for blowing up the pipelines, an accusation dismissed by the White House.""There is a party or a party that, in the absence of the functioning of these gas pipelines, is able to sell more LNG at a higher price. This side is well known, it is the United States,"" Peskov said.Peskov stopped short of saying who the Kremlin thinks was behind the leaks, adding: ""there are also countries that have the military-technological capabilities to carry out such sabotage"".In the Kremlin's view, European countries - the gas buyers - and Russia as a gas seller would not be interested in the gas infrastructure stoppage.A senior Russian official said on Sunday it was technically possible to restore the Nord Stream gas pipelines, with Peskov saying on Monday they needed to be repaired but that seabed assessments had to be done first.

It is an act of common sense, and of sovereignty, to step in and design rules that respond to the unprecedented challenge we face,"" he was quoted as saying, noting both the risks of a price cap and ""the dangers of inertia"" as winter approached.EU country leaders will discuss their joint next steps to tame soaring energy prices when they meet on Friday in Prague.Skrekas said that although there was not enough time for Greece to have the proposal ready by then, the country would be able to present a comprehensive proposal before the next meeting of EU energy ministers later this month.

60,38212b82-4104-3a02-b653-92baeed9cd15,NEE,2022-10-03,"After a year of 1.0% returns, NextEra Energy, Inc.'s (NYSE:NEE) share price drop last week may have less of an impact on institutional investors",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-0-returns-nextera-energy-130106799.html,1664715666,STORY,['NEE'],"[If you want to know who really controls NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 79% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$154b last week. Still, the 1.0% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. But they would probably be wary of future losses.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of NextEra Energy, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NextEra Energy?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.NextEra Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see NextEra Energy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. NextEra Energy is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.4% of shares outstanding. With 7.4% and 5.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of NextEra EnergyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of NextEra Energy, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$261m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 21% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over NextEra Energy. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand NextEra Energy better, we need to consider many other factors.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Mastercard's current trading price of US$284 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Mastercard’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Mastercard What's The Opportunity In Mastercard?Great news for investors – Mastercard is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $454.01, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Mastercard’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will Mastercard generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 55% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Mastercard. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since MA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MA for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy MA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

After the stock price dropped 6.5% last week, the company's market value declined by US$7.1b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, sold US$3.5m worth of shares at a price of US$438 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$386). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Lockheed Martin shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Lockheed Martin Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen notably more insider selling, than insider buying, at Lockheed Martin. In that time, insider Gregory Ulmer dumped US$2.9m worth of shares. Meanwhile insider John Donovan bought US$250k worth. The share price has moved a bit recently, but it's hard to argue that the selling is a positive.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that Lockheed Martin insiders own 0.06% of the company, worth about US$64m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesSo What Do The Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Indicate?Unfortunately, there has been more insider selling of Lockheed Martin stock, than buying, in the last three months. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Lockheed Martin.

If you want to see more ETFs in this selection, click Top 5 ETFs For Beginners. According to data from Susquehanna International Group, ETF volumes in the United States climbed and accounted for 29% of the total equity transactions on September 27, the highest level since December 2018. The boost in ETF volumes came as the S&amp;P 500 declined to a new low, indicating a bear market, and the Cboe Volatility Index jumped to its highest level in three months. Investors are trying to navigate the increasingly volatile market, and they tend to take shelter in exchange traded funds. ETF trades increase during market turmoil, given they offer safety, are easy to invest in, and investors can place directional bets. Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna, told Bloomberg: “This increase in ETF volume as a percentage of overall volume is a clear indication that the focus right now is squarely on the macro environment, on finding liquidity and on playing momentum.”Beginners looking to enter the stock market amid the current turbulence can decidedly benefit from ETF trades. The activity in exchange traded funds is likely to stay high as a result of the difficult macro. Traders tend to flock towards ETFs that track the performance and investment results of large benchmark indices, for safe exposure to underlying equities like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). Our Methodology We explored ETFs that offer exposure to multiple sectors of the economy, both value and growth plays, large and small-cap equities, and dividend stocks for a well-rounded outlook of some of the top funds listed on US exchanges. We have selected the ETFs priced under $100 as of September 30, keeping in mind affordability for beginners. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. Story continuesTop 10 ETFs For BeginnersPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashTop ETFs For Beginners10. iShares Core S&amp;P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (NYSE:ITOT) NAV as of September 30: $79.47 iShares Core S&amp;P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (NYSE:ITOT) seeks to track the performance of the S&amp;P Total Market Index, offering exposure to the overall U.S. stock market, ranging from some of the smallest to largest companies. iShares Core S&amp;P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (NYSE:ITOT) has net assets of $38.8 billion as of September 30 and a portfolio consisting of 3,370 stocks. The fund was established on January 20, 2004. The expense ratio stands at 0.03% and the 30-day SEC yield is 1.54%, with iShares Core S&amp;P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (NYSE:ITOT) making quarterly dividend payments. It is one of the best ETFs for beginners. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) features as the largest holding of iShares Core S&amp;P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (NYSE:ITOT), representing 5.92% of the total portfolio. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the best technology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In Q2 2022, 128 funds reported owning stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 131 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading position holder in the company, with approximately 895 million shares worth $122.3 billion. Like Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the favorite stocks of elite hedge funds. Here is what Distillate Capital has to say about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Apple was the largest new purchase in the quarter, at a 2% weight. Apple underperformed the overall market last quarter, and given very minimal debt, this price weakness translated into a commensurate fall in its enterprise value. For stocks with higher debt levels, it takes a disproportionately bigger market cap drop to achieve the same valuation improvement and this is a key reason we avoid highly leveraged names where significant price weakness can be experienced during a revaluation process. Alongside this decline in EV for Apple, its estimated free cash flows have risen steadily throughout the year. This contrast between a falling enterprise value and rising free cash flow, which is highlighted in Figure 12, made the stock sufficiently better valued such that it entered the portfolio. While Apple’s valuation is now attractive enough to warrant inclusion in the portfolio, it still ranks in the bottom quartile of the portfolio’s holdings and so the stock’s initiating weight is capped at a 2%. This contrasts significantly with Apple’s near-7% position in the S&amp;P 500 benchmark, and reflects both our preference to avoid too much concentration risk as well our goal of ensuring that the overall portfolio valuation is as attractive as possible while balancing characteristics of stability and low indebtedness.”9. Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:SCHG) NAV as of September 30: $56.49Next on our list of the top ETFs for beginners is Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:SCHG), which aims to closely track the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index. The fund offers exposure to large-cap U.S. equities that exhibit growth characteristics. Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:SCHG) was established at the end of 2009, and the net assets as of September 29 came in at $13.2 billion. The expense ratio is 0.04% and Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:SCHG) provides potential for tax-efficiency. The fund has 250 holdings in its portfolio, which is passively managed. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the premier holdings of Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:SCHG). Technology stocks represent a major portion of the portfolio, followed by healthcare, consumer discretionary, and communications services firms. Smart investors flock to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and with 258 long positions, it was the most popular stock among hedge funds according to Insider Monkey’s Q2 2022 database. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 28.7 million shares worth $7.36 billion. Here is what Baron Durable Advantage Fund has to say about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Microsoft Corporation, a leading global provider of software solutions, declined 16.6% in the quarter along with the broader software group as well as due to growing concerns of a potential macro-driven slowdown. This is despite the company posting strong quarterly financial results and successfully absorbing headwinds from the war in Ukraine. The company had 21% revenue growth, 23% operating income growth, and 35% growth in Microsoft Cloud (all year-over-year in constant currency), which now represents 47% of total revenues.As discussed above, we continue to believe Microsoft remains a durable and growing business as companies across all industries look to digitally transform, taking advantage of the continuously expanding solution set Microsoft has to offer.”8. Fidelity Value Factor ETF (NYSE:FVAL) NAV as of September 30: $40.01Fidelity Value Factor ETF (NYSE:FVAL) seeks to track the performance of the Fidelity U.S. Value Factor IndexSM, exposing investors to large and mid-cap U.S. companies with attractive valuations. At the end of August, the net assets stood at $471.8 million. As of November 2021, the expense ratio of Fidelity Value Factor ETF (NYSE:FVAL) has been 0.29% and at the end of June 2022, the portfolio had 127 long positions. Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) is expected to present new versions of the Pixel 7 smartphone and its Pixel Watch, the first smartwatch using Google technology. According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 153 hedge funds were long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), compared to 160 funds in the earlier quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with approximately 2.5 million shares worth $5.4 billion. Here is what Lakehouse Capital specifically said about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported another strong quarterly result despite the tough macroeconomic conditions. Revenue increased by 13% as Search proved resilient, primarily led by strength in the travel and retail verticals. YouTube advertising growth was lighter and moderated due to a tough comparison period and a general softening in brand advertising spend. That said, YouTube’s user engagement and time spent still continues to grow which bodes well for future monetisation opportunities. Google Cloud outpaced the company’s overall growth with revenue increasing by 36% and while it has yet to show any signs of profitability, we remain supportive of Alphabet continuing to reinvest in its cloud business given the size of the market opportunity ahead. On the cost front, the company added another 10,000 employees during the quarter, but notably, the CFO mentioned that hiring will likely slow down over the next twelve months as the company focuses on greater operating efficiency. Overall, we’re pleased with how the company has performed and are confident that management will be able to control costs, if or when the economic environment becomes more challenging.”7. iShares MSCI ACWI ETF (NASDAQ:ACWI) NAV as of September 30: $77.81 iShares MSCI ACWI ETF (NASDAQ:ACWI) tracks the investment results of MSCI ACWI Index, which offers exposure to a mix of large and mid-capitalization developed and emerging market securities. iShares MSCI ACWI ETF (NASDAQ:ACWI) has a net expense ratio of 0.32% and the net assets as of September 30 came in at $14.3 billion. The fund was established on March 26, 2008. The portfolio holds 2,336 stocks and offers a 30-day SEC yield of 1.72%. iShares MSCI ACWI ETF (NASDAQ:ACWI) primarily invests in the information technology, financial, healthcare, consumer discretionary, industrials, consumer staples, and communications sectors. It is one of the best ETFs for balanced exposure to international markets.One of the top holdings of iShares MSCI ACWI ETF (NASDAQ:ACWI) is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), an American multinational technology conglomerate. On September 29, Citi analyst Ronald Josey reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a $185 price target, citing the company's refreshed device line-up which promotes its connected home vision. The analyst noted that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) remains his top pick with its Prime Early Access Sale ahead of the Holiday season, which boosts Prime member engagement, consistent Web Services growth, and progress on cost efficiencies.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 252 funds were long Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 271 funds in the prior quarter. Jaime Sterne’s Skye Global Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 15.4 million shares worth $1.6 billion.  Here is what Lakehouse Capital specifically said about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) proved resilient in the face of ongoing macro pressures and delivered a strong quarterly result along with “better-than-feared” guidance for the third quarter. Net sales increased 7% year-on-year (10% constant currency) to $121.2 billion, while operating profit declined 57% to $3.3 billion. The drop in operating profit was attributable not only to external macro factors, such as elevated shipping and fuel costs, but also lower productivity and efficiency costs as a result of some overcapacity on the back of its recent investment cycle. It was pleasing to see that the company has begun to make progress on the more controllable costs, particularly productivity and staffing, with headcount, for example, down almost 100,000 over the quarter. We continue to believe Amazon is well positioned to manage these short-term issues and remains on track to deliver significant profit improvements over the next twelve months.Management also confirmed that they have not seen any deterioration in Prime membership growth or retention following the 17% increase in Prime fees put through earlier in the year. This is not surprising to us, as in our view, the price increase was more than justified given the tremendous amount of customer value that has been added since the last price increase was implemented back in 2018, which includes the doubling of its fulfilment network and workforce, significant expansion of free same-day delivery and considerable investments in video and music content. Ultimately, we remain positive about Amazon’s future and believe that the company’s scale and market leadership will continue to drive growth for many years to come.”6. iShares Core S&amp;P U.S. Value ETF (NASDAQ:IUSV) NAV as of September 30: $62.58 iShares Core S&amp;P U.S. Value ETF (NASDAQ:IUSV) seeks to track the investment results of the S&amp;P 900 Value Index, which comprises large- and mid-capitalization U.S. value stocks.

Accordingly, the search for dividend stocks to buy for retirement is one that many take seriously.Dividend-paying stocks are often the go-to option for those nearing or in retirement. That’s partly because the passive income stream these equities generate can help bolster the social security income retirees receive. These stocks are also viewed positively for their fundamentals.That’s because companies paying a dividend (in theory) must be profitable to do so. With a strong business model and solid margins come dividend increases over time. Thus, dividend stocks are often viewed as preferable to bonds, as the distributions provided can grow over time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOf course, sifting through the many stocks that pay dividends to pick just a few to hold for the long-term isn’t easy. That said, here are dividend stocks to buy that I’m considering right now.JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$164.94MCDMcDonald’s$236.70ORIOld Republic International$20.60Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a multinational pharmaceutical and consumer goods company which leads in many prominent categories. This very strong market position, which is driven by a portfolio of some of the world’s best brands, has provided the company with very solid fundamentals. Accordingly, it’s unsurprising to many long-term investors to see the company announce a $5 billion buyback program and continued dividend increases over time.As far as dividend stocks to buy are concerned, JNJ stock may not necessarily be top of mind for most investors. After all, this stock yields only 2.7% at the time of writing. And with the 2-Year T-Bill now providing around 4.3%, that’s not going to cut it for many investors.That said, it’s Johnson &amp; Johnson’s free cash flow of $4.7 billion that’s worth considering. This cash flow number increased substantially quarter-over-quarter, and could continue higher, even in recessionary times. No matter what market we’re in, folks need to buy pharmaceuticals, toothpaste and toilet paper. That’s the allure of this blue-chip stock in this market.Story continuesNotably, Johnson &amp; Johnson has one of the strongest track records of dividend growth in the US market. This company has increased its payouts consistently for 60 years. Retirees would do well to consider adding this global pharmaceutical giant to their portfolios on any dips moving forward.McDonald’s (MCD)A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.comThe global fast food picture really wouldn’t be the same without McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD). Indeed, this long-term buy and hold for many investors provides some compelling growth metrics to consider. Over time, McDonald’s has proven what a world-class brand can do in terms of international expansion and same-store sales growth.That said, this quick restaurant provider also offers investors some attractive dividend growth. Thus, as far as dividend stocks to buy are concerned, McDonald’s is right up there on my list right now.The Chicago-based giant has a strong track record of consistently growing payouts. Ever since McDonald’s started dividend payments in 1976, it has increased its payout yearly.Given this company’s rock-solid balance sheet and continued earnings per share growth over time, investors can expect nothing less than all-but-guaranteed dividend growth over time. Aside from the pandemic, when locations were forced to close, in most other recessionary times MCD stock has outperformed the market by a wide margin. Thus, this is a company providing a seriously defensive posture investors may want to gravitate toward right now.Currently, the MCD stock yields 2.3%, which doesn’t seem that great, relative to bonds. That said, those thinking long-term will note that this yield should rise over time, along with its stock price. That’s the allure of this mega-cap stock.Old Republic International (ORI)A close-up shot of a hand choosing wooden blocks with emoticons related to health insurance. russell 2000 stocksSource: ShutterstockOld Republic International (NYSE:ORI) is not necessarily among the most well-known names out there. That said, this $6.5 billion market cap company is among the most reliable names in the insurance industry.Since 1942, this company has paid a dividend without interruption. Even more impressive, Old Republic has raised its distribution for 41 consecutive years. Thus, those seeking not only passive income, but dividend growth, will appreciate this historical performance.Generally speaking, when companies like Old Republic stick to their long-term dividend growth strategies, these stay in place for a very long time. That’s because investors start to view ORI stock as a bond-like proxy, and seek this stock for dividend growth specifically. Accordingly, investors can stand assured that this is a company that will do whatever it can to maintain, and raise, its distribution over time.Old Republic’s fundamentals appear strong, with the company reporting an underwriting profit in its insurance business consistently. Over the long-term, this is an overlooked dividend stock to buy I think is very compelling at 6-times earnings right now.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

Although, it's not wise to simply ignore the P/E without explanation as investors may be disregarding a distinct opportunity or a costly mistake.Recent times have been advantageous for Merck as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favour. See our latest analysis for Merck peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Merck will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is Merck's Growth Trending?The only time you'd be comfortable seeing a P/E like Merck's is when the company's growth is tracking the market closely.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 354% last year. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 83% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 7.9% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be similar to the 9.6% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that Merck's P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting to see average future growth and are only willing to pay a moderate amount for the stock.What We Can Learn From Merck's P/E?Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesWe've established that Merck maintains its moderate P/E off the back of its forecast growth being in line with the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement or deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a high or low P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price moving strongly in either direction in the near future under these circumstances.There are also other vital risk factors to consider before investing and we've discovered 1 warning sign for Merck that you should be aware of.You might be able to find a better investment than Merck.

The S&amp;P 500 has shed more than 20% of its value year-to-date as inflation and interest rates weigh down the equities market. Hence, investors are scrambling to streamline their portfolios. In doing so, they might want to think about some biotech stocks to sell.Biotech stocks have typically been among the most risky investments. These firms spend a ton of money on research and development and offer little to no assurance that their pipeline will ever reach the commercialization stage. Additionally, most of these companies operate at a loss for years, which has irked investors of late. Hence, it’s probably best to sell off many of the non-performing biotech stocks before more significant losses arrive.That said, it’s true that the industry is set for incredible growth over the long term. The trick for investors is to perform extensive due diligence before wagering on biotech stocks. Here are three that investors may want to discard from the watch list in the current volatile investing environment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsILMNIllumina$198.00GLPGGalapagos NV$41.81IONSIonis Pharmaceuticals$43.72Illumina (ILMN)pharmaceutical industry. Production line machine conveyor with glass bottles ampoules at factorySource: Dmitry Kalinovsky / Shutterstock.comIllumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) specializes in DNA sequencing and the provision of related analysis equipment globally. It has been the leading stakeholder in the market, which saw robust growth up until the pandemic kicked in. The pandemic gave this company a new lease of life, as its DNA sequencing technology played a significant role in identifying and monitoring COVID-19 variants. However, with the pandemic firmly in the rear-view mirror, it’s tough to foresee a scenario where Illumina can mount a comeback.Its latest results are reflective of how its business is at a crossroads. The company posted $1.16 billion in net sales in its second quarter, down 5% sequentially. Moreover, its net loss came in at a hefty $535 million, a massive drop from a net income of $185 million in the prior-year period. Its business seems frailer without Covid 19-related sales and is poised for similar showings in the upcoming quarters.Story continuesMoreover, Illumina seems to be banking on its acquisition of Grail, a past spin-off of the company, which is a cancer identification specialist. However, this catalyst remains nothing but a wildcard at this point, with the EU disapproving of the acquisition.Galapagos NV (GLPG)dollar sign written with pills spilled from a medicine bottleSource: ShutterstockGalapagos NV (NASDAQ:GLPG)  is a Belgian biotech company whose claim to fame is its rheumatoid arthritis (RA) medicine, Filgotinib. Filgo is available for use in the European Union, Great Britain, and Japan but hasn’t been able to break into the highly lucrative U.S. market.In 2019, it struck a deal with another leading biotech in Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) for the development and commercialization of Filgo in the U.S. It received a massive $3.95 billion in upfront payments and another $1.1 billion in equity investment from the firm. However, Filgo was flagged by the U.S. FDA for its impact on sperm counts, which led to Gilead pulling out of its plans to commercialize the drug in the U.S. To rub further salt in Galapagos’ wounds, its top executives left the company high and dry while the company navigates through the rut it’s in currently.GLPG stock has given up its chances for commercialization in the U.S., where drugs usually enjoy a premium reimbursement compared to other parts of the world. Moreover, the competition in the rheumatoid arthritis market is heating up with every passing year, with plenty of biosimilars also coming into play of late.Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS)Animated image of different medicationsSource: Olga Kononok/ShutterstockIonis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:IONS) is another biotech in a spot of bother. Unlike GLPG stock, this company generates solid recurring revenues from a few of its approved medicines. It generates the bulk of its royalty revenues from its muscular atrophy drug, SPINRAZA. That said, Ionis generates sales from a fairly one-dimensional portfolio which it’s been looking to evolve over the past few years to no avail.Ionis had multiple trial failures in the past 12 months, which present a sordid picture for its future. On top of that, recent results have been sub-par, with the company guiding for $575 million in sales this year, compared to $810 million last year. Operating expenses are expected to remain at a healthy $825 million to $850 million. Thus, though Ionis appears to have a relatively solid foundation, this company also trades at a lofty valuation relative to future prospects.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing GuidelinesMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

77,2038e7bc-8dff-3004-b11a-9138e9090072,PWR,2022-10-03,7 Sleeper Growth Stocks to Buy Before Wall Street Wakes Up,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-sleeper-growth-stocks-buy-220958773.html,1664489398,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'QSR', 'VIE.PA', 'AMSC', 'BB', 'PWR', 'BROS']","[September has historically been the worst month for stocks. With the S&amp;P 500 down 7.5% with one trading day to go, you could say September is living up to its reputation. Well, almost. The index actually did worse in April and June, falling 9% and 8.8%, respectively. For September to claim its title, the S&amp;P 500 would need to close the month below 3,582. After today’s rout, that would take a drop of about 1.6%. Certainly not out of the realm of possibility. Given this, you might be wondering why I’m writing about growth stocks to buy.I have three reasons.First, September is coming to an end and we are headed into a traditionally stronger period for stocks and the start of the Q3 earnings season. July, which marked the start of the Q2 earnings season, was by far the best month for stocks this year, with the S&amp;P 500 up 9.2%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSecond, this week’s bond-buying initiative by the Bank of England showed investors that, even during periods of high inflation, central banks are ready, willing and able to come to the rescue to prevent a true financial crisis from materializing.Finally, positive data on Biogen’s (NASDAQ:BIIB) Alzheimer’s drug showed the Street that transformative technological innovations can still occur.Given these factors, investors might be more interested in growth stocks to buy. So, I’ve put together a list of seven sleeper growth stocks that are likely to surprise the Street by rallying sharply in the not-too-distant future.PWRQuanta Services$127.93BBBlackBerry$4.82AMSCAmerican Superconductor$4.45STEMStem$12.95VEOEYVeolia Environnement$18.73BROSDutch Bros$32.42QSRRestaurant Brands International$54.39Quanta Services (PWR)Numerous electric lines are seen at sunset.Source: Pand P Studio / Shutterstock.comQuanta Services (NYSE:PWR) develops, repairs and maintains electric grids globally and renewable energy systems. It also carries out engineering projects for companies involved in the production of natural gas and oil prices.Story continuesGiven its array of businesses, Quanta is very well-positioned to benefit from multiple powerful trends. These include the proliferation of electric vehicles, which, as we’re seeing in California, will require an extensive strengthening and extension of electric grids. Additionally, the use of renewable energy is growing rapidly, while oil and natural gas exploration is, in general, increasing amid elevated prices.In June, UBS analyst Steven Fisher upgraded PWR stock to “buy” from “neutral,” citing “confidence in [Quanta’s] EPS growth ahead from electric grid investment and renewed upside potential from [its fossil fuel business].” Fisher also predicted that the company would benefit from President Joe Biden’s plan to pause tariffs on solar panels imported from a number of Southeast Asian countries for two years.PWR stock has an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of just 17.6. UBS’ target price of $156 is 22% above the current share price.BlackBerry (BB)the BlackBerry logo presented on a white backgroundSource: ShutterstockOnce a dominant smartphone brand, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) is now in the business of providing companies and governments with intelligent security software and services.The company reported its latest quarterly results this week. The stock sold off following the announcement despite earnings and revenue beats. More importantly, though, the report showed BlackBerry’s two major businesses are heating up.Internet of Things revenue jumped 28% year over year in BlackBerry’s fiscal second quarter to $51 million, with gross margin of 82%. The unit includes BlackBerry’s highly secure QNX operating system, which is now deployed in over 200 million vehicles globally, according to CEO John Chen. QNX is gaining market share in connected vehicles and electric vehicles. For instance, Volkswagen (OTC:VLKAF) recently decided to deploy QNX in all of the vehicles that will utilize the German automaker’s new operating system.Meanwhile, while cybersecurity revenue fell 8% from a year ago, the division’s billings rose 15% on a sequential basis to $102 million. And cybersecurity billings were up 6% year over year in the first half of the fiscal year.The increased need for cybersecurity among companies and governments and the proliferation of connected cars should bolster BlackBerry’s financial results in the coming quarters and years. For those with speculative capital, consider putting BB on your list of growth stocks to buy.American Superconductor (AMSC)Battery storage at a Solar Farm with switchgear or switch gear in the backgroundSource: Dorothy Chiron / Shutterstock.comAmerican Superconductor (NASDAQ:AMSC) specializes in the design and manufacturing of power systems, including electric utilities and renewable energy, and superconducting wire. It’s on today’s list of growth stocks to buy because it has budding “green shoots” in the defense and renewable energy sectors.In January, the company announced it had provided the U.S. Navy with the first of four contracted protection systems. As the company explained it, the system is “essentially a network of cables coursing through the ship, with the electrical current in the cables calibrated to counteract the magnetic field fluctuations as it travels through the water, masking the ship’s magnetic signature and preventing it from activating undersea mines.”On the renewable energy front, two major companies — one in South Korea and one in India — are utilizing American Superconductor’s electrical control systems in wind turbines. Meanwhile, firms across several sectors, including semiconductors, electrical utilities and miners, are buying the company’s products to regulate the flow of electricity.American Superconductor’s backlog jumped 30% year over year in its most recently reported quarter, according to CEO Daniel McGahn, indicating the company is stealthily growing its business. McGahn also said during the latest earnings call that he expects the company to benefit from the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act, which includes significant tax breaks for clean energy.Shares are down by nearly 60% year to date and trade with a price-to-sales ratio of just 1.2. But they aren’t likely to remain this undervalued for long.Stem (STEM)A hand holds an electric vehicle battery charger up to a car.Source: ShutterstockStem’s (NYSE:STEM) software utilizes artificial intelligence to maximize the utility of electricity storage systems and batteries. It also offers solar energy monitoring systems.The company has entered the EV charging market, marketing its Athena software as a solution for monitoring, managing and optimizing EV chargers. The company believes Athena opens up a multi-billion-dollar total addressable market. Given the rapid growth of the EV market, I’m inclined to agree with that assessment.At the end of the second quarter, Stem had 2.1 gigawatts of assets under management, up from 1.2 gigawatts at the same point a year earlier. And the company’s backlog jumped an incredible 191% year over year in Q2 to $727 million.On Sept. 22, Cowen analyst Thomas Boyes initiated coverage of STEM stock with an “outperform” rating. He wrote that the company “has taken an early lead in the energy storage space, leveraging its Athena software platform, and is well positioned to capture demand both in front of and behind the meter applications.”Boyes’ $22 price target implies upside of nearly 70% from the current level.Veolia  Environnement (VEOEY)Veolia sign text and brand logo French company Environnement and supplier of water services in all worldSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comClimate change and population gains are leading to droughts in many parts of the world, including Texas, California, Nevada, South America and Europe. And, of course, access to water is a perpetual problem in parts of the Middle East and Africa.I strongly believe that, within the next few years, many countries will have to turn to desalination, despite the objections of some environmentalists and the high cost. Desalination, which involves removing the salt from saltwater, reportedly is twice as expensive as obtaining water from freshwater sources. Governments that have already embraced desalination, including California and Israel, will have to add desalination plants.For investors, the best way to play the coming desalination boom is with Veolia Environnement (OTC:VEOEY). According to the company, “With a total treatment capacity of approximately 13 million m3 of water per day at more than 2,300 sites in 108 countries across the world, Veolia is the world leader in desalination. ”Veolia already has a significant foothold in the Persian Gulf, whose oil-rich countries can afford to build many desalination plants. Specifically, Veolia has already built one plant in the United Arab Emirates and one in Kuwait.Water is vital to life, and that makes Veolia Environnement vital as well.Dutch Bros (BROS)Dutch Brothers (BROS) at Papago Plaza in Scottsdale Arizona.Source: RicoPatagonia / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) owe a good deal of their success to the fact that they were able to win over young adults, thereby obtaining the “coolness” factor. There’s an excellent chance that Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS), which sells coffee and other beverages exclusively in drive-through windows, is embarking on a similar path to riches.A year ago, Grizzle reported, “Dutch Bros has successfully attracted a younger demographic, one with potentially more disposable income which can be spent on premium priced coffee-shop beverages.”Apparently, millennials and Generation Z are attracted to the company’s proprietary high-energy coffee drink and whipped topping, as well as its healthy, non-coffee beverages. A millennial friend of mine also raves about what he views as the company’s very friendly servers.In Q2, the company’s top line jumped 44% from a year ago to $186.4 million as it opened 31 new shops. Gross profit from company-operated shops came in at $31.2 million, up 6% from the same period a year earlier.Restaurant Brands International (QSR)a tray of food from popeyesSource: Tony Prato / Shutterstock.comLast up on today’s list of sleeper growth stocks to buy is Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR). The owner and franchiser of Tim Hortons, Burger King, Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and Firehouse Subs is a superb “trade down” name. In other words, if the economy goes south, the company is well-positioned to attract middle-class families who are switching from casual-dining fare to fast food.Indeed, its restaurants are already popular. Popeyes has been crowned king of the chicken sandwich wars. And with McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) abandoning its McPlant burger offering, Burger King has the vegan burger fast-food market nearly to itself in America. Personally, I’m a big fan of Burger King’s Impossible Burger.Analysts, on average, expect earnings per share to climb 7.5% this year to $3.03 and 5.3% to $3.19 in 2023.  Currently, shares are trading at a reasonable 17.1 times next year’s earnings estimates. Meanwhile, revenue is expected to increase 12% this year and just over 5% next year.While those growth numbers aren’t flashy, QSR stock also throws off a 3.9% dividend yield.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of AMSC, BB and STEM.

79,8ef99c43-f2cb-30c7-b668-01c8a59e15d6,CI,2022-10-03,Is Weakness In Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) Stock A Sign That The Market Could be Wrong Given Its Strong Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-cigna-corporation-nyse-ci-130118943.html,1664715678,STORY,['CI'],"[With its stock down 3.7% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Cigna (NYSE:CI). But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Cigna's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Cigna How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cigna is:12% = US$5.5b ÷ US$46b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.12 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Cigna's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo start with, Cigna's ROE looks acceptable. Even so, when compared with the average industry ROE of 15%, we aren't very excited. Still, we can see that Cigna has seen a remarkable net income growth of 24% over the past five years. Therefore, there could be other causes behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. Bear in mind, the company does have a respectable ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is higher. So this certainly also provides some context to the high earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesWe then compared Cigna's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 18% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Cigna's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Cigna Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Cigna's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 0.3% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (100%) of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Moreover, Cigna is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 17% over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for Cigna is speculated to rise to 16% despite the anticipated increase in the payout ratio. There could probably be other factors that could be driving the future growth in the ROE.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Cigna's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

80,da8cd8f3-aa68-36f2-ae1a-70d939b27ac0,SWKS,2022-10-03,7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Before the Bull Market Returns,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-semiconductor-stocks-buy-bull-162819404.html,1664468899,STORY,"['AMD', 'SWKS', 'MRVL', 'ASML', 'MU', 'INTC', 'GFS']","[While listing semiconductor stocks to buy typically generates a positive response, this year provides a contrasting case. Though the major indices all printed red ink since the start of 2022, technology-centric market ideas suffered disproportionately. Nevertheless, bold contrarians may enjoy an upside opportunity in the long run.Firstly, semiconductor stocks to buy trade cyclically. With the Federal Reserve committed to raising the benchmark interest rate, risk-on sentiment faded due to higher borrowing costs. However, it’s unlikely that this circumstance will stay like this forever.Secondly, the companies undergirding semiconductor stocks to buy align with several relevant sectors, such as data centers, blockchain functionality, or even video games. Unless these market segments become obsolete, having a long-term framework for the semis is probably a reasonable wager.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFinally, on the domestic front, the passage of the CHIPS Act for America should help bolster manufacturing activities. While not everyone benefits directly from the legislation, increased activities should spark positive spillover effects. Therefore, below are the semiconductor stocks to buy for contrarian investors.ASMLASML Holding NV$422.25AMDAdvanced Micro Devices$64.39INTCIntel$26.36GFSGlobalFoundries$49.60MUMicron Technology$49.83SWKSSkyworks Solutions$89.61MRVLMarvell Technology$42.78ASML Holding NV (ASML)Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboardSource: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockWhile the category of semiconductor stocks to buy features plenty of the usual suspects, a growing number of investors identified ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) as a significant long-term opportunity. As per CNBC, the Netherlands-based ASML “is the only firm in the world capable of making the highly complex machines needed to manufacture the most advanced chips.”Unfortunately, geopolitical flashpoints and supply chain disruptions prevent ASML from acquiring essential commodities. Therefore, it received no exemption from the pain associated with buying formerly popular semiconductor stocks. Since the start of the year through the Sept. 28 session, ASML slipped nearly 45%. Story continuesAt the same time, the long-term implications for the underlying company make it an attractive bet. While it’s difficult to see now, peace will probably return to eastern Europe at some point. Per Gurufocus.com, ASML features a modestly undervalued financial profile. Its main highlights include a longer-term robust growth trajectory and excellent profitability metrics.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Close up of AMD sign in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American multinational semiconductor company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comOne of the most popular manufacturers of graphics processing units (or GPUs) for advanced video game systems and cryptocurrency mining, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) long represented one of the semiconductor stocks to buy. However, some might argue that AMD features meme-ish qualities and often receives hype on investing forums. Of course, 2022 has been a bit of a culture shock for Advanced Micro Devices. Rather than leading the charge, it represents the technology sector’s laggards. For instance, AMD stock fell more than 54% since the start of the year. During the same period, the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 30%. It’s weird to say the index “performs better” than AMD, but it’s mathematically appropriate.Still, the video gaming sector should come back in the years ahead. Per data cited by the World Economic Forum, global gaming revenue should hit $321 billion by 2026. On top of that, cryptos tend to gyrate in the extreme. Once a bullish cycle enters the space, AMD could be a massive beneficiary due to the aforementioned crypto mining relevancies.Intel (INTC)Source: IntelOnce the undisputed king of semiconductor stocks to buy, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has presented a rough profile in recent years. Controversies and competitive pressures have put the chipmaker on the backfoot several times. For example, INTC sank nearly 29% in the trailing five-year period. During the same period, rival AMD gained a whopping 436%. So far this year, the performance for Intel is better but only on a relative basis, down 49%. Still, investors have had a tough time trusting INTC as one of the semiconductor stocks to buy. In late July this year, CNBC reported that Intel’s poor earnings reflected diminishing demand for PCs.Nevertheless, Intel may generate some positive momentum in the data center market. Based on recent data, Intel commands a 69.5% share of the data center market. In addition, according to Allied Market Research, the global data center market could grow from $187.35 billion in 2020 to $517.17 billion by 2030.GlobalFoundries (GFS)In this photo illustration GlobalFoundries (GFS) Inc. logo is seen on a mobile phone screen.Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.comA multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company, GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS), benefits from geopolitical dynamics. As Investor’s Business Daily bluntly put it:For the U.S. and a growing number of countries, the fact that many chipmakers operate in Taiwan remains a problem. Growing military tension between the U.S. and China over Taiwan is one reason.The solution? It might seem obvious, and finally, politicians took notice.GlobalFoundries makes most of its semiconductors in upstate New York, Dresden, Germany, and Singapore. In addition, the outlook for GlobalFoundries stock has brightened as more customers sign long-term deals to ensure chipmaking capacity is there when they need it. The company has also told analysts that it has more than $20 billion in long-term agreements that can’t be canceled.However, despite long-term positive implications, GFS stock remains down 21% year-to-date. Still, investors committed to a patient outlook should regard GFS as one of the semiconductor stocks to buy.Micron Technology (MU)An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock.Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.comAn American chip manufacturer, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), specializes in computer memory and data storage, including dynamic random-access memory, flash memory, and USB flash drives. Currently, the company represents one of the essential cogs in the political narrative to bring back critical manufacturing to the U.S. Earlier this month, Micron broke ground for a manufacturing fab in Boise, Idaho. More significantly, management has stated that the investment was possible via the CHIPS and Science Act. Still, the news hasn’t helped MU stock in the open market. Since the January opener, Micron shares are nearly 47% below parity. At the same time, the red ink may represent a bold contrarian opportunity for semiconductor stocks to buy.According to Gurufocus.com, MU features a significantly undervalued financial profile. Notably, MU commands a forward price-earnings ratio of just under 6x. That’s well below the industry median of 14x.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comA wireless semiconductor company, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), “designs and manufactures radio frequency and complete semiconductor system solutions for mobile communications applications,” per a Bloomberg description. Per Skyworks’ website, the company seeks to “launch the true potential of 5G.” Specifically, Skyworks brings the registered trademark SKY5 unifying platform to its 5G small cell and multiple-input, multiple-output (or MIMO) technology.Although compelling on paper, investors ran from SWKS stock throughout this year. Since the start of 2022, SWKS has fallen nearly 42%. In the trailing month, it’s down almost 8%. However, a patient approach could yield significant gains, making Skyworks one of the semiconductor stocks to buy.Per Gurufocus.com, the tech firm features a significantly undervalued financial profile.

Primarily, the company specializes in advanced connectivity protocols, offering computational, security, and networking platform solutions. On a related note, Marvell also features a vast data center portfolio, enabling its enterprise-level clients to scale up quickly and securely.In addition, the tech firm’s automotive innovations, particularly in safety mechanisms and autonomous driving solutions, give Marvell significant upside potential. Currently, though, Wall Street doesn’t see it that way. MRVL is down over 50% YTD. In the trailing month, the stock declined by 9%.However, for the contrarian investor, Marvell presents an attractive profile. Per Gurufocus.com, MRVL is significantly undervalued based on its proprietary valuation metrics. Notably, in the quarter that ended July 2022, Marvell posted revenue of $1.52 billion, up 41% year-over-year. Moreover, net income came in at $4 million, much more favorable than the net loss of $276 million in the same quarter last year.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.92bUS$3.39bUS$3.81bUS$4.24bUS$4.56bUS$4.82bUS$5.04bUS$5.24bUS$5.41bUS$5.56bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x4Analyst x2Est @ 7.42%Est @ 5.77%Est @ 4.62%Est @ 3.82%Est @ 3.25%Est @ 2.86% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.6% US$2.8kUS$3.0kUS$3.2kUS$3.4kUS$3.5kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$33bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 5.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.6b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (5.6%– 1.9%) = US$155bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$155b÷ ( 1 + 5.6%)10= US$90bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$123b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$470, the company appears quite good value at a 41% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Northrop Grumman as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.861. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Housing affordability is rapidly declining. The Federal Reserve is deliberately not helping. Big tech names such as Meta are doing hiring freezes.

These reports will provide much-needed insight into the mindset of a consumer who is still being hurt by inflation and is now seeing their 401ks shredded. Does Conagra's frozen food business see a lift from consumers trading down from eating out? How is Constellation's Corona brand doing with restaurant traffic showing more mixed trends of late? Will Levi's — a rare retail winner in 2022 — follow peers VF Corp. and Nike by warning about the holidays? I think all of these reports could be mixed at best, and inject the latest dose of fear into an already nervous market.A Levi's jeans 50% off sale at Vineland Premium Outlets in Orland, Florida. (Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Market Action: With markets down a lot, pay careful attention to how stocks react to bad news. I found it interesting that shares of chipmaker Micron went up the day after it issued sales guidance almost $2 billion below consensus forecasts. If we get more reactions like this, then it would be OK to begin considering a short-term bottom in the markets. Worthwhile to ponder on this front: The forward price-earnings ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is 15.4 times, below the five-year average of 18.6 times and below the 10-year average of 17.1 times according to FactSet.Story continues5 other events to watch for: (1) Who is the first Fed member to signal a pause in rate hikes is not too far out into the distance?

This week’s list includes FedEx FDX, Nike NKE, Micron MU, Conagra CAG and Constellation Brands STZ.Previewing Q3 Earnings After Rough Reports from Nike, MicronWe had been skeptical about extrapolating too much from FedEx’s downbeat quarterly numbers as we see a big part of the problems as FedEx specific. But FedEx is hardly alone in pointing towards a cloudier horizon.We don’t typically associate Nike with management and operational missteps, but we just heard them tell us about a large inventory overhang that’s having negative implications for margins and profitability. Part of the +44% jump in Nike’s inventory is reportedly related to apparel whose movement through the company’s supply chain was impacted by ongoing logistical challenges.We don’t know the details, but it’s fair to assume that some part of the inventory buildup is related to softening demand. After all, the U.S. Fed’s ongoing tightening cycle is directed at crimping aggregate demand as a way to bring down inflationary pressures.Nike’s inventory problem validates what we heard from retailers in the Q2 reporting cycle. Chipmaker Micron is faced with a comparable issue that forced it to cut guidance and slash CapEx to bring chip supplies in alignment with market demand that has come down as a result of weakening PC, tablet and smartphone sales.We are starting to look at these early reports from FedEx, Nike, Micron and others for their fiscal periods ending in August as giving us a preview of what likely lies ahead as the banks kick-off the Q3 reporting cycle in about two weeks. For the record, we and other data vendors count these early reports as part of the Q3 earnings season.Through Friday, September 30th, we have seen a total of 15 S&amp;P 500 members report results in recent days, including the aforementioned companies. We have another 4 index members on deck to report results this week, including Conagra and Constellation Brands.Story continuesTotal earnings for these 15 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results are down -8.3% from the same period last year on +10.5% higher revenues, with 66.7% beating EPS estimates and 53.3% beating revenue estimates.We are trying hard not to draw any conclusions here given how small the sample size of Q3 results are at this stage. But it’s hard to put a gloss on the fact that these 15 index members, some of whom are true bellwethers, struggled to beat consensus estimates.In fact, you can see above that the 2022 Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking the 5-year lows for this group of companies. Needless to add, it is hardly a reassuring start to the Q3 reporting cycle.The Earnings Big Picture2022 Q3 earnings are expected to be up +0.9% on +9.1% higher revenues.Don’t forget that it is the strong contribution from the Energy sector that is keeping the aggregate Q3 earnings growth in positive territory. Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the S&amp;P 500 index would be down -5.8% from the same period last year.Analysts have been lowering their estimates since the quarter got underway.The -5.8% decline expected in Q3 on an ex-Energy basis is down from +2.1% in early July.Third quarter estimates have come down for all sectors, except Energy and Autos, with the biggest declines within Consumer Discretionary, Basic Materials, Consumer Staples, Technology, and Construction.In the aggregate, 2022 Q3 earnings estimates for the S&amp;P 500 index have been cut -6.5% since mid-June. If we look at the revisions trend after excluding the Energy sector where estimates are still going up, aggregate Q3 estimates have declined by -8.5% since mid-June.Estimates for 2022 Q4 and full-year 2024 have also been coming down.These aren’t modest cuts to estimates, but rather towards the higher end of the historical range. The key takeaway here is that estimates have already been coming down. Yes, there may be some more cuts ahead, as we can reasonably expect will happen with estimates for Nike and Micron in the days ahead.But to suggest that earnings estimates have to massively come down to reach a ‘fair’ level would imply that we are projecting a global financial crisis type of economic event on the horizon, which is hard to justify given current economic fundamentals. We should also keep in mind that corporate earnings and revenues are in ‘nominal’ (or not adjusted for inflation) dollars and will largely keep pace with inflationary trends.The +6.8% earnings growth expected for the index this year drops to +0.3% once the Energy sector’s contribution is excluded.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Are Earnings Estimates Out of Sync with the Economy?  Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

And corporate profit warnings from large, well-known companies are piling up as the Fed's rate hikes apply the brakes to the economy.Earlier this month, FedEx (FDX) shocked the market by slashing its full year guidance. Wednesday brought a material full year profit warning from North Face owner V.F. Corp. and reports of Apple (AAPL) cutting iPhone production on growth fears.

(NYSE:NKE) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 23.1x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, NIKE's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for NIKE peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on NIKE will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Does Growth Match The High P/E?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as NIKE's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 7.1%. However, a few very strong years before that means that it was still able to grow EPS by an impressive 31% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would probably welcome the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 13% per annum over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.6% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that NIKE's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Key TakeawayIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Story continuesWe've established that NIKE maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Many other vital risk factors can be found on the company's balance sheet.

Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.The fourth quarter for the stock market could be as cold as the third quarter — after all, what is there to be excited about at the moment?Interest rates are rising. Housing affordability is rapidly declining. The Federal Reserve is deliberately not helping. Big tech names such as Meta are doing hiring freezes. Industrial giants like Fedex are canning people before the holidays. VF Corp. and Nike dropped warnings on the heads of battered investors. And Apple is reportedly cutting iPhone production.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Given this backdrop, here are a few things I am watching with the fourth quarter officially underway:Consumer Earnings: This week will bring results from Conagra, Constellation Brands, McCormick and Levi's. These reports will provide much-needed insight into the mindset of a consumer who is still being hurt by inflation and is now seeing their 401ks shredded. Does Conagra's frozen food business see a lift from consumers trading down from eating out? How is Constellation's Corona brand doing with restaurant traffic showing more mixed trends of late? Will Levi's — a rare retail winner in 2022 — follow peers VF Corp. and Nike by warning about the holidays? I think all of these reports could be mixed at best, and inject the latest dose of fear into an already nervous market.A Levi's jeans 50% off sale at Vineland Premium Outlets in Orland, Florida. (Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Market Action: With markets down a lot, pay careful attention to how stocks react to bad news. I found it interesting that shares of chipmaker Micron went up the day after it issued sales guidance almost $2 billion below consensus forecasts. If we get more reactions like this, then it would be OK to begin considering a short-term bottom in the markets. Worthwhile to ponder on this front: The forward price-earnings ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is 15.4 times, below the five-year average of 18.6 times and below the 10-year average of 17.1 times according to FactSet.Story continues5 other events to watch for: (1) Who is the first Fed member to signal a pause in rate hikes is not too far out into the distance?

(definitely wouldn't be good); (4) Do investors brush aside third-quarter earnings reports being severely hurt by the surging U.S. dollar?

And corporate profit warnings from large, well-known companies are piling up as the Fed's rate hikes apply the brakes to the economy.Earlier this month, FedEx (FDX) shocked the market by slashing its full year guidance.

91,e2b9e847-d99f-3146-8356-c190279b31ce,WFC,2022-10-03,"With 73% institutional ownership, Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/73-institutional-ownership-wells-fargo-110039850.html,1664794839,STORY,['WFC-PD'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 73% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Wells Fargo. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Wells Fargo. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Wells Fargo's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Wells Fargo is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.5% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.2% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Wells Fargo &amp; Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$112m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 26% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Wells Fargo. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Wells Fargo better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Wells Fargo that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/E.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Pfizer has been doing relatively well. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially, which has repressed the P/E. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour. See our latest analysis for Pfizer peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Pfizer will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/E?Pfizer's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver limited growth, and importantly, perform worse than the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 140% last year. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 138% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings growth is heading into negative territory, declining 14% per annum over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.6% growth per annum, that's a disappointing outcome.With this information, we are not surprised that Pfizer is trading at a P/E lower than the market. Nonetheless, there's no guarantee the P/E has reached a floor yet with earnings going in reverse. Even just maintaining these prices could be difficult to achieve as the weak outlook is weighing down the shares.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Pfizer's P/EWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.As we suspected, our examination of Pfizer's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings is contributing to its low P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.There are also other vital risk factors to consider before investing and we've discovered 1 warning sign for Pfizer that you should be aware of.If you're unsure about the strength of Pfizer's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, PayPal Holdings' earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on PayPal Holdings will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Does Growth Match The High P/E?PayPal Holdings' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 58% decrease to the company's bottom line. As a result, earnings from three years ago have also fallen 17% overall. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 34% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.6% per year, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that PayPal Holdings' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Bottom Line On PayPal Holdings' P/EGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesWe've established that PayPal Holdings maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Having said that, be aware  PayPal Holdings is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

Whether you use the arbitrary “down 20%” rule of thumb or simply look at the price action, it’s clearly bear-market territory. However, bear markets can often spell opportunity, even for small investors. And even for investors who have only $500 to spend, there are options. What are the best stocks for $500?Before we talk about the stocks, investors must realize the long-term trend of the market.Since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has delivered an annual gain roughly 80% of the years. While that span covers the last eight decades, the index also has given investors similar (or better) results over the last 20, 30, 40 and 50 years. So while we may be in the midst of a bear market now, we won’t be in one forever.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLong-term investors who buy the shares of companies with solid balance sheets and strong cash flows now will be rewarded. With that in mind, let’s look at a few of the best stocks for $500.TickerCompanyCurrent PriceMSFTMicrosoft$235GOOGL, GOOGAlphabet$96.25,$96.83PYPLPayPal$88Best Stocks for $500: Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has traded terribly so far this year and just made new 52-week lows this week. However, with the stock down so much from its high, long-term investors have a great opportunity to buy the stock of what is truly a fantastic company.First, Microsoft is widely diversified and has a presence around the world. It dominates the enterprise market with its various software programs, it has a gaming division (which it’s looking to bolster with a pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI)), a social media arm with LinkedIn and a robust cloud unit known as Azure.These are among the businesses that are big drivers for Microsoft’s top and bottom lines. Speaking of which, analysts, on average, expect MSFT to deliver double-digit-percentage revenue growth from now through FY 2026. That’s alongside average expectations calling for 10% earnings growth this year and an 18% increase in 2023.Story continuesWe also can’t forget that Microsoft has better operating margins than all of the FAANG names.Lastly, the stock has been decimated. At the stock’s recent low, the shares were down about 33% from their all-time high in November. Microsoft’s shares have only fallen more than 30% one other time in the last 12 years, and that was when they dropped 30.5% during the Covid-19 selloff.Best Stocks for $500: Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG)GOOG stock: letters spelling out googleSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.comAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) also belongs on this list, but with a caveat. It’s a fabulous company with strong cash flows, a robust balance sheet and incredible assets.Owning Google.com and YouTube.com is like owning Boardwalk and Park Place in Monopoly; they are the two most popular websites on the internet. Analysts, on average, expect double-digit-percentage growth from Alphabet for at least the next four fiscal years, while the company holds roughly $125 billion of cash and short-term securities.For all of this, the owners of GOOG stock are paying less than 20 times this year’s earnings.So what’s the caveat? The economy.If we do see a global recession — particularly a harsh one — Alphabet’s business will be hampered. Its top line will be pressured, while its profits will suffer as its margins are squeezed.But that’s only a short-term challenge that investors have to make it through. After all, the shares have already fallen 36% from this year’s high as the market is discounting the stock for these reasons. For comparison, Alphabet stock has only fallen more than 30% two other times in the last 12 years: A 31% fall in 2010 and a 34% decline during the Covid-19 selloff.PayPal (PYPL)For the last stock on this list, you could choose any number of businesses. Some healthcare stocks have little to no exposure to the decline in non-U.S. currencies. Others stocks have fallen, even though their revenue and demand have not fallen.But I’m going to go with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) for my last pick.Starting with the bad news, PayPal stock suffered a peak-to-trough decline of over 80% and remains 70% below its all-time high.Further, analysts, on average, expect its earnings to fall 14.5% this year despite anticipating a near-10% gain in its revenue. The estimates indicate that it’s generating strong  sales, while its margins are declining. Lastly, PYPL is a growth stock and so, unsurprisingly, it has sold off amid this bear market.Now for the good news.Analysts, on average, expect double-digit-digit revenue growth for PayPal in each of its next four fiscal years. As far as earnings, mean estimates call for 23% growth next year and an 18.75% jump in 2024.Second, unlike many of its growth-stock peers, PayPal is profitable and generates positive cash flow. The firm reported trailing annual free cash flow of more than $5 billion and trades at 23 times analysts’ average earnings estimates and less than 20 times their mean 2023 expectations.PayPal’s balance sheet could be a little better, but with more than $9 billion in the bank and $6 billion of net debt, the company should be just fine. And all of this comes after the company recently beat average earnings and revenue expectations and raised its full-year guidance.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The study, released during National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, found that incident responders surveyed – the frontline responders to cyberattacks – are primarily driven by a strong sense of duty to protect others; a responsibility that's increasingly challenged by the surge of disruptive attacks, from the proliferation of ransomware attacks to the recent rise of wiper malware.Cybersecurity Awareness Month - IBM Security Sense of DutyOrganizations that are essential to the global economy, supply chains and the movement of goods have become prime targets for disruptive attacks. In 2021 IBM Security X-Force observed cyberattacks against energy companies quadrupling from the year prior, while manufacturers saw more ransomware attacks than any other industry – from food manufacturers to medical devices, cars and steel manufacturers. As cyberattacks threaten essential services to our daily needs, incident responders in these industries are faced with more pressure to defend the digital front line. In fact, 81% of respondents stated that the rise of ransomware has exacerbated the psychological demands associated to cybersecurity incidents.The global survey of over 1,100 cybersecurity incident responders in 10 markets, conducted by Morning Consult and sponsored by IBM Security, revealed trends, and challenges that incident responders experience due to the nature of their profession. Some key highlights include:Story continuesA Sense of Service – Over a third of incident responders were attracted to the field by a sense of duty to protect and opportunity to help others and businesses. For nearly 80% of respondents, this was one of the top reasons attracting them to IR.Fighting Multiple Battlefronts – Amid a growing number of cyberattacks in recent years, 68% of incident responders surveyed stated it's common to be assigned to respond to two or more overlapping incidents simultaneously.Impact on Daily Life – The high demands of cybersecurity engagements also affect incident responders' personal lives, with 67% experiencing stress or anxiety in their daily lives. Insomnia, burnout and impact on social life or relationships followed as effects respondents cited. Despite these challenges, the vast majority acknowledged they have a strong support system in place.""The real-world repercussions that cyberattacks now have are causing public safety concerns and market-stressing risks to grow,"" said Laurance Dine, Global Lead, IBM Security X-Force Incident Response. ""Incident responders are the frontline defenders standing between cyber adversaries causing disruption and the integrity and continuity of critical services. IBM salutes all IR teams  across the cybersecurity community, and the essential role they play in defending the digital front line.""An Uneven Battlefield In recent years, not only have cyberattacks become more disruptive, but their sheer volume has increased. X-Force saw a nearly 25% rise in cybersecurity incidents its IR team engaged in from 2020 to 2021. Add to that, Check Point Software Technologies research indicates  a 50% increase in overall network attacks per week in 2021 compared to 2020. But as the industry is called to respond to a growing number of cyberattacks, there's only a finite number of security professionals specifically trained and skilled to respond to cybersecurity incidents.As a result, while many IR teams are forced to take on multiple battlefronts, businesses could be left without the necessary resources to mitigate and recover from cyberattacks. The IBM study found that 68% of incident responders surveyed find it common to simultaneously need to respond to two or more cybersecurity incidents, highlighting a field that is constantly engaged. Amongst U.S. respondents 34% said the average length of an IR engagement was 4-6 weeks, while a quarter cited the first week as often the most stressful or demanding period of the engagement. During this period about a third of respondents work more than 12 hours per day on average.A Strong Support System in PlaceAs incident responders take on the pressure and high demands associated with cyber response, the overwhelming majority of respondents acknowledged they have a strong support system in place. Specifically, most respondents feel their leadership has a strong understanding of the activities IR involves, while 95% say it provides the necessary support structure for them to be successful. As well, 84% state they have adequate access to mental health support resources, with many respondents (64%) seeking out mental health assistance due to the demanding nature of responding to cyberattacks.But businesses can further support incident responders, whether in-house Blue Teams or the external IR teams they engage in the event of a cyber crisis, by prioritizing cyber preparedness and creating plans and playbooks that are customized to their environment and resources. This can help enable a more agile and quick response at the onset of an incident and alleviate an unnecessary layer of pressure across the business.To that end, situational awareness of their infrastructure is important. Businesses can focus on testing their state of readiness through simulation exercises, not only to get a feel of how their teams will react under attack, but to provide opportunities to correctly integrate multiple teams that are engaged during a cyber incident.Additional ResourcesRead the complete findings from IBM Security's Incident Responder studyCelebrate and recognize incident responders this Cybersecurity Awareness Month hereRead a Security Intelligence blog on incident responders holding the digital frontlineTo register for IBM Security X-Force's incident response webinar, ""Tales from the Digital Frontlines,"" on Wednesday, October 12 at 1:00 pm ET, sign up hereSchedule a consult with IBM Security X-ForceAbout IBM SecurityIBM Security offers one of the most advanced and integrated portfolios of enterprise security products and services.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Occidental Petroleum OXY, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Hess Corp. HES.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Oil Reclaims $80 After EIA Reports Supply Draw on All FrontsU.S. oil prices bounced back from an eight-month low after government data showed a weekly draw in crude, gasoline and distillate supplies.A decline in stocks across the board together with a falling dollar and supply disruptions from Hurricane Ian saw the commodity rise above $80-a-barrel. However, it remained under pressure from recessionary fears.On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures settled at $81.23 a barrel yesterday. Investors should know that oil slipped to a nine-month low of around $77 earlier in the week — the lowest since January.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Sep 23.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 215,000 barrels compared to expectations of a 300,000-barrel decrease per the analysts. The combination of a surge in exports, lower imports and a dip in domestic production accounted for the stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer even as refinery demand contracted.Total domestic stocks now stand at 430.6 million barrels — 2.9% more than the year-ago figure but 2% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) rose 692,000 barrels to 25.7 million barrels.Story continuesMeanwhile, the crude supply cover increased from 26.7 days in the previous week to 26.9 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 28.2 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies decreased for the second time in three weeks. The 2.4 million-barrel fall was primarily attributable to a surge in demand. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would rise 900,000 barrels. At 212.2 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 4.3% less than the year-earlier level and 6% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) dropped after rising for four weeks in a row. The 2.9 million-barrel fall reflected an uptick in demand and lower production. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply draw of some 100,000 barrels. Despite the recent decreases, current inventories — at 114.4 million barrels — are 11.8% below the year-ago level and 20% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 90.6%, fell 3% from the prior week.Final WordWTI prices recently posted its longest run of weekly losses in 2022 following the Federal Reserve's decision to hike interest rates further in line with many other central banks across the world to step up the fight against soaring inflation. The tightening monetary policies have sparked concerns about a possible recession and, consequently, slowing crude demand. A stronger greenback, which can weaken dollar-denominated commodities like crude, also contributed to the downside.What stands out is that rates may not have peaked yet, and more toughness could be in store for the remainder of this year and 2023. This is because attempts are being made to cool the 40-year high inflation and prevent it from becoming entrenched.However, the U.S. benchmark has regained some ground in the wake of EIA’s bullish inventory report. Prices also drew support from the greenback’s climbdown from a 20-year high, which can strengthen dollar-denominated commodities like crude.As it is, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group (OPEC+) agreeing on a production curtailment, the Oil/Energy market has enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.As a matter of fact, the Energy Select Sector SPDR — an assortment of the largest U.S. companies thronging the space — has risen nearly 31% year to date against a 24% loss for the broader S&amp;P 500 benchmark.Consequently, three of the top five gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum, Marathon Petroleum and Hess Corp.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 114%.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now. JPMorgan analysts, who have been staunch equity bulls for most of the year, believe that a soft landing is a plausible scenario for the global economy, and this will provide positive catalysts for risky assets. Marko Kolanovic and Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou of JPMorgan said in mid-September that latest data highlights abating inflation and employment pressures, recovery in economic growth, and a rebound in consumer confidence. These factors lead the analysts to believe that a global recession can be avoided. The analysts stated:“Economic data and investor positioning are more important factors for risky asset performance than central bank rhetoric. We maintain a pro-risk stance.”JPMorgan further noted that a measured easing in inflation will be an optimistic catalyst for cyclical stocks and small-cap companies. The investment firm favors cyclicals and small-caps, as well as emerging-market names and Chinese securities as compared to “expensive” defensive plays. JPMorgan is bullish on energy and commodities as well. Explaining its stance further, the firm reiterated: “We maintain that inflation will resolve on its own as distortions fade and that the Fed has over-reacted with 75bps hike. We will likely see a Fed pivot, which is positive for cyclical assets.”Some of the best cyclical stocks to buy now include General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), and Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP). Our Methodology We carried out an extensive assessment of cyclical industries, including restaurants, hotels, airlines, furniture, high-end fashion retailers, and automobile manufacturers. We selected the following stocks based on positive analyst coverage, resilient demand despite a difficult macro environment, and strong hedge fund sentiment. We have arranged the list according to the hedge fund sentiment around the securities, which was assessed from Insider Monkey’s Q2 2022 database of about 900 elite hedge funds. Story continues11 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy NowImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayBest Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now11. Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG) is a California-based operator of fast-casual restaurants serving healthy foods prepared from seasonal and organic ingredients. On September 13, Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG) announced that it will open its first restaurants in Indiana and Minnesota. This move will bolster Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG)’s Midwest presence. On September 9, Cowen analyst Andrew Charles raised the price target on Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG) to $23 from $20 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst said he remains confident in Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG)’s path to profitability and the company’s goals to double its store outlets in 3 years to 330 locations and to 1,000 locations by 2030.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 15 funds reported owning stakes in Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG), up from 12 funds in the prior quarter. Kevin Michael Ulrich and Anthony Davis’ Anchorage Advisors is the leading position holder in the company, with 4.8 million shares worth $55.8 million. In addition to General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), and Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG) is one of the best cyclical stocks to buy now. Here is what Baron Small Cap Fund has to say about Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“This quarter we participated in the IPO of Sweetgreen. Sweetgreen is one of the fastest growing restaurant chains in the U.S. and sits at the intersection of health and wellness, plant-based food consumption, digital adoption, and purpose-driven brands. As of the third quarter of 2021, the company operated 140 restaurants in 13 states, with the goal of being as ubiquitous as traditional fast food.Sweetgreen’s menu is designed to be a delicious, customizable, and convenient way to empower customers to make healthier choices for both lunch and dinner. They currently offer signature salads, warm bowls, and plates that are complemented by a seasonal menu that changes five times a year. Sourced from over 200 domestic food partners, Sweetgreen’s assortment of roughly 40 freshly prepared or cooked ingredients allows customers to create millions of unique, customized orders to accommodate almost any flavor profile or dietary preference and allows for high frequency of use. The company utilizes a multichannel approach with 68% of revenue via digital channels and 47% of revenue coming through their own App. This is one of the highest digital penetration rates among restaurant companies, which gives Sweetgreen a valuable data and customer relationship advantage relative to peers. Digital customers tend to come more often and spend 20% more on average. Also, this data helps assess market density and viable new store locations.With just 140 restaurants in 13 states there is considerable whitespace for the company to expand and we believe the company can grow units at a 25% CAGR over the next five years as they enter new markets, densify existing regions, and introduce new restaurant formats such as drive-thru and pick-up only. Historically concentrated in large urban markets, Sweetgreen should benefit from a recovery in those markets as the effects of COVID recede, driving outsized same-store sales, and potentially over 40% revenue growth over the next two years. Sweetgreen has also been planning for future growth by intentionally building additional capacity in existing restaurants to handle more order volume without adding more costs or square footage. Unit economics are already strong with new restaurants expected to generate revenues of approximately $3 million, with a healthy restaurant-level profit margin of 18%-plus, and year two cash-on-cash returns of over 40%.

(NYSE:CHPT) with an Outperform rating and a $22 price target. The analyst is ""positive on ChargePoint"" as he thinks it has an advantageous capital-light growth model, first-mover advantage with integrated solutions, and an attractive valuation.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 17 hedge funds were bullish on ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ:DKNG) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) is an American fantasy sports contest and sports betting company. On September 29, the firm was added as a new best long idea at Hedgeye, given that the company now seems to be making progress on repairing some of its issues and reclaiming lost market share.

(NASDAQ:DKNG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Shares of DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) fell in the quarter, as stocks of online gaming companies were under pressure. Sports betting and i-gaming are rolling out with great fanfare and success across the country; however, investors seem concerned about competition and margins. Most participants are spending heavily on marketing and promotions, which is cutting into margins. We see this as a worthy investment in customer acquisition at a moment in time when revenues are just building. We continue to believe that online sports betting and gaming will be enormous industries, and that DraftKings will be a leading player. We think the business will have high margins as it matures. We believe we are underwriting the business conservatively and see much upside in the long term.”7. Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) is an American multinational conglomerate holding company, and its products include toys, puzzles, board games, sports equipment, and electronic games. Hasbro, Inc.

(NASDAQ:HAS) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 38 funds in the prior quarter. Connor Haley’s Alta Fox Capital Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.14 million shares worth over $257 million. Like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), and Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), elite hedge funds are monitoring Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) in the current market environment. Here is what ClearBridge Large Cap Growth ESG Strategy has to say about Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“In addition to finding value in engaging on climate risks, net-zero targets and new technologies, we also add value to our investment process with engagements on a variety of governance topics. For example, we have long supported toy and game maker Hasbro’s (NASDAQ:HAS) management and board on strategic, operational and ESG-related topics; the company ranks highly on almost all areas of ESG evaluation, including diversity at board and all-employee levels. We maintain long-term relationships with Hasbro management, and in April 2022, after an activist shareholder started pushing for strategic change at the company, we stepped up our dialogue with senior management and the board.While we appreciate some of the concerns raised by the activist, we were against most of its suggestions, which we believed would be destructive to long-term shareholder value. We did not believe it was in our best interest to replace three board members with activist-nominated board members – the existing board is replete with talent from the media, technology, content, gaming, entertainment and social media industries.Over multiple meetings with Hasbro’s CEO and CFO and as many as three board members, our strong relationships helped us better understand what changes would be made where appropriate, and what strategies would remain intact. We had frequent opportunities to share our thoughts on board composition, long-term strategic priorities, compensation, capital allocation and disclosures. All of these became important topics for review during this time. In June 2022 the activist’s proposals were rejected by shareholders. We remain in support of management as it continues on its path of brand-building and growing digital content for its customers.”6. Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) is an American automotive aftermarket parts company. On September 15, Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) declared a $1.50 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend was paid to shareholders on September 30. The company delivered a dividend yield of 3.84%. Although the stock dropped notably after its Q2 earnings release, the long-term growth thesis seems to be intact. It is one of the best cyclical stocks for dividend growth investors. On August 25, Raymond James analyst Bobby Griffin reiterated a Strong Buy rating on Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) but lowered the price target on Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) to $220 from $250. While he trimmed FY22 estimates primarily on the back of lower-than-expected comp sales performance for Q2 and lowered forecasts for DIY demand in the second half, the analyst expects Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP)’s margin expansion to remain robust. He views Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) as ""uniquely positioned to perform well in this environment"" relative to most retailers due to the internal margin improvement opportunities that are entirely dependent on revenue.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 33 funds were long Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 29 funds in the last quarter. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.25 million shares worth close to $218 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Large Cap Growth Strategy has to say about Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Several encouraging macro trends are emerging in support of two areas outside tech: consumer spending and industrial production. Unlike in past recessions and recoveries, consumer balance sheets have actually improved dramatically since the onset of the pandemic. We expect the supply chain constraints contributing to inflation and goods shortages will begin to lessen with an ambitious rebuilding of inventories. This should be a multi-year phenomenon beneficial to quality industrials with high levels of organic growth like distributors such as Advance Auto Parts.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now.  Suggested articles:12 Best Hemp Stocks To Buy Now15 Biggest Asset Management Companies11 Best Cruise Stocks To Buy Now Disclosure: None. 11 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

There's a lot of negative consumer sentiment in the marketplace. So we're obviously concerned about that,"" Randy Parker, chief executive officer of Hyundai Motor North America, said in an interview after the automaker reported a 3% rise in vehicle sales.GM said it sold 555,580 vehicles in the quarter through September, 24% higher than last year when inventory shortages hit sales. Toyota's sales fell 7.1% to 526,017 vehicles in the same period.GRAPHIC - U.S. sales of major automakershttps://graphics.reuters.com/USA-AUTOS/SALES/jnpweqadrpw/chart.pngGM outsold Toyota by about 80,000 vehicles through the first nine months of the year. Toyota in 2021 topped GM in sales by about 110,000 vehicles, the first time since 1931 that GM did not lead the U.S. auto industry in sales.Referring to the 2021 win, Toyota President Akio Toyoda last week told dealers he did a ""'happy dance' in my office"" when the figures were announced.U.S. new vehicle sales in September finished at 1.11 million units, with an annual sales rate of 13.49 million, according to Wards Intelligence data.GM, whose shares closed up 2.4%, added it would boost production of its Chevrolet Bolt electric models in response to higher demand.Story continuesShipping finished-vehicles to consumers proved to be another headache for some companies.

The Oracle of Omaha owns companies spanning industries from tech to oil and gas to finance and banking. But which ones are the best value? Let’s take a look at seven of the best undervalued Warren Buffett stocks to buy now — before they rebound and it’s too late.Undervalued Warren Buffett Stocks: Apple (AAPL)Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a record revenue of $83 billion in the third quarter. It earned $1.20 per diluted share. In the quarter, Apple’s product and iPhone unit accounted for $63.36 billion and $40.67 billion in revenue, respectively. Just as PC sales fell in the quarter, so too did Apple’s Mac revenue. Yet that is partly due to supply constraints. Revenue fell from $8.24 billion to $7.38 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsApple expects gross margins of 41.5% to 42.5%. Foreign exchange and product mix are reasons for the decline. Better leverage will offset those headwinds. Inflation is hurting the economy, but Apple did not notice any obvious evidence. For example, the company reported strong iPhone sales. Mac and iPad sales were constrained by supply.In the service sector, the macroeconomic environment hurt digital advertising. Overall, Apple overcame those challenges by posting strong growth. The company reported record growth geographically and across every product category. Customers are more engaged with Apple. This will increase the company’s profitability.Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) already formed a bottom in the low $105 range. AMZN stock has more room to rebound. In the second quarter, the e-commerce firm posted revenue growth of 7.2% year-over-year (YOY) to $121.2 billion. It lost 20 cents a share.Amazon’s revenue is growing below the rate of inflation. Still, its revenue excludes Prime Day sales, which occurred on July 12-13, 2022. Last year’s results included Prime Day.Story continuesAmazon increased its spending by around 40% on warehouses and transportation capacity. When they open up in 2023 and beyond, the company will ship more product volume, increasing its revenue. Operating efficiency will increase for its cloud service, AWS. For example, AWS costs will include depreciation in future quarters.Amazon has new investments and sales force growth across more regions. This increases its infrastructure efficiency. In addition, customers will sign extended contracts at favorable prices. Investors will benefit from more predictable revenue from the AWS unit.Undervalued Warren Buffett Stocks: General Motors (GM)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) reported Q2 earnings per share of $1.14. Revenue grew by 4.6% YOY to $35.76 billion. Supply chain disruptions hurt GM, especially in June 2022. This temporary blip delayed GM stock from rebounding.GM expects a net income of up to $11.2 billion in the fiscal year 2022. It will earn up to $7.50 (dilution-adjusted).Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said that inflation and chip shortages hurt volumes and its product mix in the quarter. He is confident that GM will make up for that volume in the back half of the year. To adjust for a downturn, GM will pause hiring. But it will support the electric vehicle (EV) strategy by adding critical skill hires. As GM removes billions in unnecessary discretionary spending, shareholders should expect efficiencies to pay off.GM will improve its product mix next. For example, it has a new refresh of full-sized trucks. Its SUVs will have strong demand after GM introduced enhancements. Strong demand for vehicles will let GM sell at higher prices. This could lift its profits.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with ""diesel"" and ""food mart"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) posted record-breaking net earnings of $11.62 billion in the last quarter. The EPS of $5.95 is nearly quadruple over last year. The company enjoyed cash flow from operations of $13.8 billion. Free cash flow topped $10.6 billion.Chevron historically grew its dividend for 35 consecutive years. It increased rates by 6% earlier this year. With its strong FCF, the company may increase its investments in traditional and new energy. In the first half of the year, investments rose by 80% compared to last year. In addition, Chevron plans to maintain its strong balance sheet. For five quarters in a row, it has paid down debt. Its net debt ratio of 8% is below its mid-cycle guidance of 20% to 25%.Chevron will increase shareholder returns by buying back $15 billion a stock at an annual rate. This will continue over the next few years, regardless of oil prices potentially falling. Investors should hold CVX stock through the commodity cycle.Undervalued Warren Buffett Stocks: Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is not a high-yield investment. It recently declared a 13-cent per share quarterly dividend. It is prioritizing paying down its debt and buying back shares.OXY stock is nowhere near a peak. The stock said last quarter that it would repay another $5 billion in debt. It already paid back $3.6 billion in debt. Once it achieves the $5 billion debt reduction, it will buy back $3 billion in shares. Investors may infer that Buffet likes Occidental’s shareholder return framework.The company is cautious about the energy market conditions ahead. It expects a slight dampening for the rest of the year. Long-term investors may use any share price weakness to accumulate a position. Long-term fundamentals are supportive of higher margins.Occidental will outperform thanks to strong results from its midstream and marketing units. It reported higher margins from its gas processing and sulfur sales. Furthermore, Occidental optimized its gas transportation activity in the Permian and Rockies.Bank of America (BAC)A photo of the Bank of America (BAC) logo in neon red and blue on a tan wall.Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.comBank of America (NYSE:BAC) posted revenue growing by 5.7% YOY to $22.7 billion. It also declared a quarterly cash dividend of 22 cents a share. The penny increase is a 5% hike. The small dividend raise is restricted by regulatory requirements and the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) Quantitative Results.Ahead of BAC stock rebounding, investors should buy the stock. By next year, the bank will resume its 3-cent per share dividend increase. It will also buy back more shares.The company increased its customer base by adding a million new checking accounts YOY. This is an ideal customer addition, because the product is stable. Customers rarely close the product. As interest rates rise, customers are even less likely to close their accounts.The higher interest rates will add $2 billion to Bank of America’s net interest income. That is $900 million to $1 billion this quarter and again in the next quarter. Since operating costs are consistent at $15 billion to $15.5 billion, the bank will report higher margins.Undervalued Warren Buffett Stocks: VeriSign (VRSN)hands typing on a computer keyboard under a computer screenSource: ShutterstockVeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN) manages domain name registrations. Its mission is to enable the world to connect online. In the second quarter, the company achieved a milestone of 25 years of 100% availability in the dot-com and dot-net domain name resolution system.In the second quarter, VeriSign posted revenue growth of 6.8% to $352 million. It earned $1.54 a share. Domain name registrations are trending lower. Investors should expect a fall after a pandemic-driven increase in registrations. Still, the company has favorable long-term trends. CEO James Bidzos said that new registrations are looking more similar to pre-pandemic levels.VeriSign has a strong recurring revenue trend. It saw continued strong renewal rates for past renewed names. This rate is typically in the mid-80% range. Customers that registered during the pandemic are renewing their names. This will strengthen VeriSign’s core renewal business.For five years, the company did not raise prices. After studying the market, it determined it could hike prices. The next price increase will take effect on Feb. 1, 2023.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.The fourth quarter for the stock market could be as cold as the third quarter — after all, what is there to be excited about at the moment?Interest rates are rising. Housing affordability is rapidly declining. The Federal Reserve is deliberately not helping. Big tech names such as Meta are doing hiring freezes. Industrial giants like Fedex are canning people before the holidays. VF Corp. and Nike dropped warnings on the heads of battered investors. And Apple is reportedly cutting iPhone production.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Given this backdrop, here are a few things I am watching with the fourth quarter officially underway:Consumer Earnings: This week will bring results from Conagra, Constellation Brands, McCormick and Levi's. These reports will provide much-needed insight into the mindset of a consumer who is still being hurt by inflation and is now seeing their 401ks shredded. Does Conagra's frozen food business see a lift from consumers trading down from eating out? How is Constellation's Corona brand doing with restaurant traffic showing more mixed trends of late? Will Levi's — a rare retail winner in 2022 — follow peers VF Corp. and Nike by warning about the holidays? I think all of these reports could be mixed at best, and inject the latest dose of fear into an already nervous market.A Levi's jeans 50% off sale at Vineland Premium Outlets in Orland, Florida. (Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Market Action: With markets down a lot, pay careful attention to how stocks react to bad news. I found it interesting that shares of chipmaker Micron went up the day after it issued sales guidance almost $2 billion below consensus forecasts. If we get more reactions like this, then it would be OK to begin considering a short-term bottom in the markets. Worthwhile to ponder on this front: The forward price-earnings ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is 15.4 times, below the five-year average of 18.6 times and below the 10-year average of 17.1 times according to FactSet.Story continues5 other events to watch for: (1) Who is the first Fed member to signal a pause in rate hikes is not too far out into the distance? (would be bullish); (2) Does Friday's jobs report blow away estimates again? (would be bearish); (3) Does UPS warn on earnings like rival FedEx? (definitely wouldn't be good); (4) Do investors brush aside third-quarter earnings reports being severely hurt by the surging U.S. dollar?

(NYSE:PNC) insiders disposed of US$4.1m worth of stock",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-pnc-financial-130057012.html,1664715657,STORY,['PNC'],"[The fact that multiple The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, Michael Lyons, for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$183 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$149. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of PNC Financial Services Group shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.PNC Financial Services Group Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at PNC Financial Services Group. Specifically, Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking Michael Lyons ditched US$584k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes PNC Financial Services Group Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. PNC Financial Services Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$210m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought PNC Financial Services Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of PNC Financial Services Group.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The challenged top line and increased discounting led to the company posting an operating loss of $168 million in the quarter.Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stock is down 58% so far in 2022.Here are the details behind McShane's bearish Bed Bath &amp; Beyond call:Price Target: $2 (reiterated)Rating: Sell (reiterated)Stock price movement assumed: -67%Bed Bath and Beyond at The Avenue shopping mall at Carriage Crossing in Collierville, Tenn.

""We expect higher inventories of home goods at discounters (i.e. Big Lots and Ollie's Bargain Outlets) as well as a likely more promotional environment in retail overall could further weigh on margins.""McShane added that ""there could be upside if the company is successful at finding more cost savings (which in our management call back they indicated was possible), which could help offset this potential pressure and further their goal for breakeven cash flow by Q4.""Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's sales have tanked in recent quarter.Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's sales have really fallen off.Bed Bath &amp; Beyond will remain a money losing outfit into 2023, according to McShane's modeling.""We update our estimates post the second quarter earnings miss and reiterated fiscal year 2022 outlook,"" the note stated.

On the other hand, we note it's down 10.0% in about a month. We note that the broader market is down 9.6% in the last month, and this may have impacted Target's share price.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.

One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Target achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 13% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 21% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Target's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Target's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Target, it has a TSR of 194% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Target shareholders are down 34% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 22%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 24%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   4 warning signs  we've spotted with Target .We will like Target better if we see some big insider buys.

After the stock price dropped 6.5% last week, the company's market value declined by US$7.1b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, sold US$3.5m worth of shares at a price of US$438 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$386). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Lockheed Martin shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Lockheed Martin Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen notably more insider selling, than insider buying, at Lockheed Martin. In that time, insider Gregory Ulmer dumped US$2.9m worth of shares. Meanwhile insider John Donovan bought US$250k worth. The share price has moved a bit recently, but it's hard to argue that the selling is a positive.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that Lockheed Martin insiders own 0.06% of the company, worth about US$64m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesSo What Do The Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Indicate?Unfortunately, there has been more insider selling of Lockheed Martin stock, than buying, in the last three months. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Lockheed Martin.

Radars constitute a vital part of their defense equipment. While radars have been in use since World War II for locating threats and targets, nowadays, they are being used for multiple purposes like ground surveillance, missile control, fire control, air traffic control, moving target indication, weapons location and vehicle search.Demand for military radar systems has expanded manifold in recent times, driven by factors like a rise in defense spending of emerging economies, an increase in regional tensions and inter-country conflicts that have boosted threats from missiles and aircraft.

Disney Media &amp; Entertainment Distribution said the tentative pact covering Dish TV and Sling TV “properly reflects fair market value” for the programming suite, which includes ESPN, Disney Channel, FX, Freeform and ABC owned-and-operated stations.According to Dish, Disney had asked for a $1 billion increase in fees as part of renewing the deal, which had expired Sept. 30. Dish also claimed that Disney was demanding that ESPN and ESPN2 be included in Dish TV packages that currently exclude sports channels, and to require ABC local channels to be carried for all subscribers in eight markets.“We have reached a handshake agreement with Dish/Sling TV, which properly reflects fair market value and terms for the Walt Disney Co.’s unparalleled content,” Disney said in a statement. “As a result, we are pleased to restore our portfolio of networks on a temporary basis while both parties work to finalize a new deal.”Dish wrote in a tweet just after midnight ET, “We are pleased to announce that all your Disney and ESPN channels have been restored. Thank you for your patience and support.”Dish is the fourth biggest pay-TV operator in the U.S., after Comcast, Charter and DirecTV.

130,fc3b420f-c590-3db5-925c-a254f8b82ea2,CL,2022-10-03,7 Recession Stocks That Can Survive Stagflation,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-recession-stocks-survive-stagflation-162352602.html,1664468632,STORY,"['MCD', 'ETR', 'DG', 'LOW', 'CL', 'PGR', 'DLMAF']","[With the major equity indices printing gallons of red ink this year, investors naturally began searching for recession stocks. However, a new source of anxiety now appears on the horizon: stagflation.Per NerdWallet, stagflation represents higher consumer costs merging with rising unemployment and little, if any, economic growth. Recently, World Bank President David Malpass stated that it could take years for global energy production to diversify away from Russian hydrocarbons, according to Reuters. Unfortunately, this dynamic prolongs the risk of stagflation, thus necessitating a search for recession-resistant stocks to buy.During a speech at Stanford University, Malpass warned that there was an increased likelihood of recession in Europe. In addition, China’s growth was slowing sharply and U.S. economic output contracted in the first half of the year. Therefore, the Federal Reserve has a mighty tough job ahead of it, further bolstering the case for recession stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTrue, the Fed remains committed to tackling inflation through raising the benchmark interest rate. At the same time, too aggressive of an approach could lead to high unemployment. Therefore, the uncertainties force closer examination of recession stocks to buy.DGDollar General$240.67DLMAFDollarama$57.41CLColgate-Palmolive$72.54MCDMcDonald’s$235.27LOWLowe’s$191.34ETREntergy$104.88PGRProgressive$117.98Dollar General (DG)Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, middaySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) is a popular dollar store chain. As of April of this year, the company operates 18,216 stores in the continental U.S. Featuring everyday household items at sharply discounted prices, Dollar General easily represents one of the best recession-resistant stocks to buy.While not the greatest performance by itself, DG stock has gained more than 2% since the start of the year, at the time of writing. However, compared to benchmark S&amp;P 500 index, which is down more than 22% during the same period, the resilience of DG implies that it can potentially survive a recessionary shock — or even stagflation.Story continuesAt the moment, DG features a strong buy consensus rating among 17 Wall Street analysts, per TipRanks. Dollar General has an average price target of $276.31, representing 14.7% upside from the time of writing.Per Gurufocus.com, Dollar General features a fairly valued financial profile. Notably, the company enjoys strong profitability metrics, particularly a net margin of nearly 6.6%.Dollarama (DLMAF)Dollarama logo in front of their local shop in downtown Montreal, Quebec.Source: BalkansCat / Shutterstock.comOperating under a similar principle to Dollar General above, Dollarama (OTCMKTS:DLMAF) offers international exposure to investors of recessions stocks. Headquartered in Montreal, Dollarama is a Canadian discount retail chain. It has over 1,400 stores and a presence in every province in Canada.Unsurprisingly, DLMAF has performed well this year, gaining almost 15% at the time of writing. With the U.S. benchmark equity index down in bear market territory, any investor will take that. Fundamentally, Dollarama offers everyday household goods at low prices, making DLMAF an effective name among recession stocks to buy.Currently, the security enjoys a strong buy consensus rating among nine analysts, per TipRanks. DLMAF’s average price target is $64.29, reflecting 11% upside from the close of the Sept. 28 session.To be fair, Gurufocus.com rates DLMAF as modestly overvalued. However, the underlying company does feature excellent growth and profitability metrics. In particular, Dollarama features a net margin of 16%.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comA multinational consumer products company, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) specializes in various household and personal care products. Of course, it’s probably best known for its toothpaste brand Colgate. Considering the relative price inelasticity of the underlying products (i.e., even in an economic downturn, people will still brush their teeth), CL represents one of the best recession stocks to buy.At the moment, Wall Street doesn’t see it that way. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Colgate-Palmolive shares have slipped nearly 15%. Over the trailing month, CL has lost more than 8% of its market value. Still, this framework presents a potential acquisition opportunity for a standout among recession stocks to buy.According to Gurufocus.com, the investment resource labels CL as modestly undervalued. Notably, the underlying firm enjoys robust profitability metrics. For instance, Colgate-Palmolive’s operating margin stands at 20.6%. In contrast, the industry median is 4.7%.Just be warned, though, that covering analysts don’t quite see CL as a buy. Presently, it features a hold rating, although with a $81.50 price target, that implies 12% upside.McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.Source: Tama2u / ShutterstockAn iconic fast-food chain, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) represents American capitalism at its finest. Either way, investors can’t deny that MCD presents a compelling idea for recession stocks to buy. Sure, one doesn’t need to order food from the Golden Arches. However, with its sodium-rich products generating significant cravings, McDonald’s essentially has a hostage audience.Should stagflation become the norm moving forward, investors will need to get their return any way possible. If a little cynicism is thrown into the mix, so be it. At the time of writing, MCD stock is down 12% YTD. Therefore, the market doesn’t quite see the optimistic angle for the fast-food giant. However, if the economy declines, MCD could benefit from the trade-down effect.At the moment, Gurufocus.com labels MCD as fairly valued. The standout financial metrics for the business is profitability, particularly its red-hot net margin of nearly 26%.In addition, MCD features a strong buy consensus rating among 26 analysts. It also has a price target of $281.84, implying 19% upside potential.Lowe’s Companies (LOW)the front of a Lowe's storeSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Mooresville, North Carolina, Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW) specializes in home improvement products. Like its rival Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and others, Lowe’s represents an essential business, thus staying open during the initial onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Undoubtedly, this action helped the country cope with the crisis. Now, with stagflation possibly on the horizon, Lowe’s may be able to benefit consumers again.Fundamentally, the company provides the products that everyone needs. Further, the home repair and maintenance industry is relatively inelastic — recession or not, stuff happens. Therefore, LOW is an ideal name among recession stocks to buy.Enticingly, Gurufocus.com labels Lowe’s as a modestly undervalued business. While the company features an okay balance sheet, it comes alive in the growth and profitability departments. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 16.2%, above the industry median of 2.2%. Also, its net margin is 8.8%, far better than the industry median 2.5%.Entergy (ETR)Entergy sign at their headquarters in New OrleansSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAn integrated energy company, Entergy (NYSE:ETR) primarily focuses on electric power production and retail distribution operations in the southern U.S. Per its website, Entergy “delivers electricity to 3 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.”Fundamentally, utility firms represent one of the best recession stocks to buy. Whether you anticipate a sharp downturn or even stagflation, communities still need access to their electricity. Therefore, the demand profile for Entergy and related businesses is inelastic. Whether prices move up or down, consumer habits generally remain the same.Specific to Entergy, though, the company also organically advantages migration trends. As several news outlets mentioned, Texas ranks as the top destination for millennials.Per Gurufocus.com, ETR rates as fairly valued. One standout metric is its gross margin, which at 41.4% ranks above the industry median of 28.4%. Also, according to TipRanks, Entergy enjoys a moderate buy consensus rating among nine analysts. It features a price target of $130.11, representing 21% upside potential.Progressive (PGR)A white car with the Progressive logo written across the doors in big blue lettersSource: ShutterstockOne of the most relevant recession stocks to buy, Progressive (NYSE:PGR) garners the most attention for its auto insurance business. What I like here is that state governments effectively enforce Progressive’s hostage audience. With the exception of Florida, “every state requires bodily injury liability insurance (BI), while all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., require property damage liability (PD),” according to ValuePenguin.com.Sure enough, PGR is a winner in the charts, gaining nearly 16% YTD. Over the trailing year, PGR gained nearly 31%. To be clear, PGR might not deliver resounding gains from here on out. But it’s likely that it won’t succumb to the pits, again because of its unignorable business.Admittedly, Gurufocus.com labels Progressive as modestly overvalued. However, one bright spot is the company’s excellent growth rate. Over the past three years, it features expansion in the top line of 14.2%, better than the industry median’s 6.8%.According to TipRanks, PGR does have a hold consensus rating. Its price target is $124.57, implying a 5% gain.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The company’s market cap plunged by US$11b after price dropped by 7.9% last week but insiders were able to limit their loss to an extent.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Comcast Comcast Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive VP, Daniel Murdock, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$397k worth of shares at a price of US$44.50 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$29.33). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Daniel Murdock.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of ComcastFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Comcast insiders own about US$1.1b worth of shares (which is 0.9% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Comcast Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Comcast shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Comcast insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for Comcast and we suggest you have a look.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.The fourth quarter for the stock market could be as cold as the third quarter — after all, what is there to be excited about at the moment?Interest rates are rising. Housing affordability is rapidly declining. The Federal Reserve is deliberately not helping. Big tech names such as Meta are doing hiring freezes. Industrial giants like Fedex are canning people before the holidays. VF Corp. and Nike dropped warnings on the heads of battered investors. And Apple is reportedly cutting iPhone production.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Given this backdrop, here are a few things I am watching with the fourth quarter officially underway:Consumer Earnings: This week will bring results from Conagra, Constellation Brands, McCormick and Levi's. These reports will provide much-needed insight into the mindset of a consumer who is still being hurt by inflation and is now seeing their 401ks shredded. Does Conagra's frozen food business see a lift from consumers trading down from eating out? How is Constellation's Corona brand doing with restaurant traffic showing more mixed trends of late? Will Levi's — a rare retail winner in 2022 — follow peers VF Corp. and Nike by warning about the holidays? I think all of these reports could be mixed at best, and inject the latest dose of fear into an already nervous market.A Levi's jeans 50% off sale at Vineland Premium Outlets in Orland, Florida. (Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Market Action: With markets down a lot, pay careful attention to how stocks react to bad news. I found it interesting that shares of chipmaker Micron went up the day after it issued sales guidance almost $2 billion below consensus forecasts. If we get more reactions like this, then it would be OK to begin considering a short-term bottom in the markets. Worthwhile to ponder on this front: The forward price-earnings ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is 15.4 times, below the five-year average of 18.6 times and below the 10-year average of 17.1 times according to FactSet.Story continues5 other events to watch for: (1) Who is the first Fed member to signal a pause in rate hikes is not too far out into the distance?

134,28ee4ad6-6480-3022-9ab4-d97affbbbc02,MU,2022-10-03,"FedEx, Nike, Micron, Conagra and Constellation Brands are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-nike-micron-conagra-constellation-083008496.html,1664785808,STORY,"['FDX', 'STZ', 'NKE', 'CAG', '^GSPC', 'MU']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 3, 2022 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes FedEx FDX, Nike NKE, Micron MU, Conagra CAG and Constellation Brands STZ.Previewing Q3 Earnings After Rough Reports from Nike, MicronWe had been skeptical about extrapolating too much from FedEx’s downbeat quarterly numbers as we see a big part of the problems as FedEx specific. But FedEx is hardly alone in pointing towards a cloudier horizon.We don’t typically associate Nike with management and operational missteps, but we just heard them tell us about a large inventory overhang that’s having negative implications for margins and profitability. Part of the +44% jump in Nike’s inventory is reportedly related to apparel whose movement through the company’s supply chain was impacted by ongoing logistical challenges.We don’t know the details, but it’s fair to assume that some part of the inventory buildup is related to softening demand. After all, the U.S. Fed’s ongoing tightening cycle is directed at crimping aggregate demand as a way to bring down inflationary pressures.Nike’s inventory problem validates what we heard from retailers in the Q2 reporting cycle. Chipmaker Micron is faced with a comparable issue that forced it to cut guidance and slash CapEx to bring chip supplies in alignment with market demand that has come down as a result of weakening PC, tablet and smartphone sales.We are starting to look at these early reports from FedEx, Nike, Micron and others for their fiscal periods ending in August as giving us a preview of what likely lies ahead as the banks kick-off the Q3 reporting cycle in about two weeks. For the record, we and other data vendors count these early reports as part of the Q3 earnings season.Through Friday, September 30th, we have seen a total of 15 S&amp;P 500 members report results in recent days, including the aforementioned companies. We have another 4 index members on deck to report results this week, including Conagra and Constellation Brands.Story continuesTotal earnings for these 15 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results are down -8.3% from the same period last year on +10.5% higher revenues, with 66.7% beating EPS estimates and 53.3% beating revenue estimates.We are trying hard not to draw any conclusions here given how small the sample size of Q3 results are at this stage. But it’s hard to put a gloss on the fact that these 15 index members, some of whom are true bellwethers, struggled to beat consensus estimates.In fact, you can see above that the 2022 Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking the 5-year lows for this group of companies. Needless to add, it is hardly a reassuring start to the Q3 reporting cycle.The Earnings Big Picture2022 Q3 earnings are expected to be up +0.9% on +9.1% higher revenues.Don’t forget that it is the strong contribution from the Energy sector that is keeping the aggregate Q3 earnings growth in positive territory. Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the S&amp;P 500 index would be down -5.8% from the same period last year.Analysts have been lowering their estimates since the quarter got underway.The -5.8% decline expected in Q3 on an ex-Energy basis is down from +2.1% in early July.Third quarter estimates have come down for all sectors, except Energy and Autos, with the biggest declines within Consumer Discretionary, Basic Materials, Consumer Staples, Technology, and Construction.In the aggregate, 2022 Q3 earnings estimates for the S&amp;P 500 index have been cut -6.5% since mid-June. If we look at the revisions trend after excluding the Energy sector where estimates are still going up, aggregate Q3 estimates have declined by -8.5% since mid-June.Estimates for 2022 Q4 and full-year 2024 have also been coming down.These aren’t modest cuts to estimates, but rather towards the higher end of the historical range. The key takeaway here is that estimates have already been coming down. Yes, there may be some more cuts ahead, as we can reasonably expect will happen with estimates for Nike and Micron in the days ahead.But to suggest that earnings estimates have to massively come down to reach a ‘fair’ level would imply that we are projecting a global financial crisis type of economic event on the horizon, which is hard to justify given current economic fundamentals. We should also keep in mind that corporate earnings and revenues are in ‘nominal’ (or not adjusted for inflation) dollars and will largely keep pace with inflationary trends.The +6.8% earnings growth expected for the index this year drops to +0.3% once the Energy sector’s contribution is excluded.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Are Earnings Estimates Out of Sync with the Economy?  Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now. JPMorgan analysts, who have been staunch equity bulls for most of the year, believe that a soft landing is a plausible scenario for the global economy, and this will provide positive catalysts for risky assets. Marko Kolanovic and Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou of JPMorgan said in mid-September that latest data highlights abating inflation and employment pressures, recovery in economic growth, and a rebound in consumer confidence. These factors lead the analysts to believe that a global recession can be avoided. The analysts stated:“Economic data and investor positioning are more important factors for risky asset performance than central bank rhetoric. We maintain a pro-risk stance.”JPMorgan further noted that a measured easing in inflation will be an optimistic catalyst for cyclical stocks and small-cap companies. The investment firm favors cyclicals and small-caps, as well as emerging-market names and Chinese securities as compared to “expensive” defensive plays. JPMorgan is bullish on energy and commodities as well. Explaining its stance further, the firm reiterated: “We maintain that inflation will resolve on its own as distortions fade and that the Fed has over-reacted with 75bps hike. We will likely see a Fed pivot, which is positive for cyclical assets.”Some of the best cyclical stocks to buy now include General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), and Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP). Our Methodology We carried out an extensive assessment of cyclical industries, including restaurants, hotels, airlines, furniture, high-end fashion retailers, and automobile manufacturers.

Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG) is a California-based operator of fast-casual restaurants serving healthy foods prepared from seasonal and organic ingredients. On September 13, Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG) announced that it will open its first restaurants in Indiana and Minnesota. This move will bolster Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG)’s Midwest presence. On September 9, Cowen analyst Andrew Charles raised the price target on Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG) to $23 from $20 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst said he remains confident in Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG)’s path to profitability and the company’s goals to double its store outlets in 3 years to 330 locations and to 1,000 locations by 2030.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 15 funds reported owning stakes in Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG), up from 12 funds in the prior quarter. Kevin Michael Ulrich and Anthony Davis’ Anchorage Advisors is the leading position holder in the company, with 4.8 million shares worth $55.8 million. In addition to General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), and Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG) is one of the best cyclical stocks to buy now. Here is what Baron Small Cap Fund has to say about Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“This quarter we participated in the IPO of Sweetgreen. Sweetgreen is one of the fastest growing restaurant chains in the U.S. and sits at the intersection of health and wellness, plant-based food consumption, digital adoption, and purpose-driven brands. As of the third quarter of 2021, the company operated 140 restaurants in 13 states, with the goal of being as ubiquitous as traditional fast food.Sweetgreen’s menu is designed to be a delicious, customizable, and convenient way to empower customers to make healthier choices for both lunch and dinner. They currently offer signature salads, warm bowls, and plates that are complemented by a seasonal menu that changes five times a year. Sourced from over 200 domestic food partners, Sweetgreen’s assortment of roughly 40 freshly prepared or cooked ingredients allows customers to create millions of unique, customized orders to accommodate almost any flavor profile or dietary preference and allows for high frequency of use. The company utilizes a multichannel approach with 68% of revenue via digital channels and 47% of revenue coming through their own App. This is one of the highest digital penetration rates among restaurant companies, which gives Sweetgreen a valuable data and customer relationship advantage relative to peers. Digital customers tend to come more often and spend 20% more on average. Also, this data helps assess market density and viable new store locations.With just 140 restaurants in 13 states there is considerable whitespace for the company to expand and we believe the company can grow units at a 25% CAGR over the next five years as they enter new markets, densify existing regions, and introduce new restaurant formats such as drive-thru and pick-up only. Historically concentrated in large urban markets, Sweetgreen should benefit from a recovery in those markets as the effects of COVID recede, driving outsized same-store sales, and potentially over 40% revenue growth over the next two years. Sweetgreen has also been planning for future growth by intentionally building additional capacity in existing restaurants to handle more order volume without adding more costs or square footage. Unit economics are already strong with new restaurants expected to generate revenues of approximately $3 million, with a healthy restaurant-level profit margin of 18%-plus, and year two cash-on-cash returns of over 40%.

The company develops and operates the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store concept in the United States, which comprises restaurants and decorative gift shops. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) expects total revenue growth in fiscal 2023 between 7% and 8% compared to the prior year, versus a 3.3% growth consensus. The company projects opening 3 or 4 new Cracker Barrel units and 15 to 20 new Maple Street Biscuit Company units. It is one of the best cyclical stocks to buy now, considering the growth forecasts. On September 28, Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Mullan raised the price target on Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) to $106 from $100 and kept a Hold rating on the shares after the fiscal Q4 results. While the quarter was a little challenged, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.

(NASDAQ:DKNG) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) is an American fantasy sports contest and sports betting company. On September 29, the firm was added as a new best long idea at Hedgeye, given that the company now seems to be making progress on repairing some of its issues and reclaiming lost market share.

It is one of the best cyclical stocks to invest in. On September 14, Guggenheim analyst Curry Baker raised the price target on DraftKings Inc.

Parag Vora’s HG Vora Capital Management is a significant stakeholder of the company, with 2.5 million shares valued at $29 million. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Shares of DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) fell in the quarter, as stocks of online gaming companies were under pressure. Sports betting and i-gaming are rolling out with great fanfare and success across the country; however, investors seem concerned about competition and margins. Most participants are spending heavily on marketing and promotions, which is cutting into margins. We see this as a worthy investment in customer acquisition at a moment in time when revenues are just building. We continue to believe that online sports betting and gaming will be enormous industries, and that DraftKings will be a leading player. We think the business will have high margins as it matures. We believe we are underwriting the business conservatively and see much upside in the long term.”7. Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) is an American multinational conglomerate holding company, and its products include toys, puzzles, board games, sports equipment, and electronic games. Hasbro, Inc.

The analyst forecasted toy spending to be resilient despite consumers broadly pulling back on other discretionary purchases.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 30 hedge funds were bullish on Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 38 funds in the prior quarter. Connor Haley’s Alta Fox Capital Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.14 million shares worth over $257 million. Like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), and Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP), elite hedge funds are monitoring Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) in the current market environment. Here is what ClearBridge Large Cap Growth ESG Strategy has to say about Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“In addition to finding value in engaging on climate risks, net-zero targets and new technologies, we also add value to our investment process with engagements on a variety of governance topics. For example, we have long supported toy and game maker Hasbro’s (NASDAQ:HAS) management and board on strategic, operational and ESG-related topics; the company ranks highly on almost all areas of ESG evaluation, including diversity at board and all-employee levels. We maintain long-term relationships with Hasbro management, and in April 2022, after an activist shareholder started pushing for strategic change at the company, we stepped up our dialogue with senior management and the board.While we appreciate some of the concerns raised by the activist, we were against most of its suggestions, which we believed would be destructive to long-term shareholder value. We did not believe it was in our best interest to replace three board members with activist-nominated board members – the existing board is replete with talent from the media, technology, content, gaming, entertainment and social media industries.Over multiple meetings with Hasbro’s CEO and CFO and as many as three board members, our strong relationships helped us better understand what changes would be made where appropriate, and what strategies would remain intact. We had frequent opportunities to share our thoughts on board composition, long-term strategic priorities, compensation, capital allocation and disclosures. All of these became important topics for review during this time. In June 2022 the activist’s proposals were rejected by shareholders. We remain in support of management as it continues on its path of brand-building and growing digital content for its customers.”6. Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) is an American automotive aftermarket parts company. On September 15, Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) declared a $1.50 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend was paid to shareholders on September 30. The company delivered a dividend yield of 3.84%. Although the stock dropped notably after its Q2 earnings release, the long-term growth thesis seems to be intact. It is one of the best cyclical stocks for dividend growth investors. On August 25, Raymond James analyst Bobby Griffin reiterated a Strong Buy rating on Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) but lowered the price target on Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) to $220 from $250. While he trimmed FY22 estimates primarily on the back of lower-than-expected comp sales performance for Q2 and lowered forecasts for DIY demand in the second half, the analyst expects Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP)’s margin expansion to remain robust. He views Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) as ""uniquely positioned to perform well in this environment"" relative to most retailers due to the internal margin improvement opportunities that are entirely dependent on revenue.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 33 funds were long Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 29 funds in the last quarter. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.25 million shares worth close to $218 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Large Cap Growth Strategy has to say about Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Several encouraging macro trends are emerging in support of two areas outside tech: consumer spending and industrial production. Unlike in past recessions and recoveries, consumer balance sheets have actually improved dramatically since the onset of the pandemic. We expect the supply chain constraints contributing to inflation and goods shortages will begin to lessen with an ambitious rebuilding of inventories. This should be a multi-year phenomenon beneficial to quality industrials with high levels of organic growth like distributors such as Advance Auto Parts.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now.  Suggested articles:12 Best Hemp Stocks To Buy Now15 Biggest Asset Management Companies11 Best Cruise Stocks To Buy Now Disclosure: None. 11 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

138,fc3b420f-c590-3db5-925c-a254f8b82ea2,MCD,2022-10-03,7 Recession Stocks That Can Survive Stagflation,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-recession-stocks-survive-stagflation-162352602.html,1664468632,STORY,"['MCD', 'ETR', 'DG', 'LOW', 'CL', 'PGR', 'DLMAF']","[With the major equity indices printing gallons of red ink this year, investors naturally began searching for recession stocks. However, a new source of anxiety now appears on the horizon: stagflation.Per NerdWallet, stagflation represents higher consumer costs merging with rising unemployment and little, if any, economic growth. Recently, World Bank President David Malpass stated that it could take years for global energy production to diversify away from Russian hydrocarbons, according to Reuters. Unfortunately, this dynamic prolongs the risk of stagflation, thus necessitating a search for recession-resistant stocks to buy.During a speech at Stanford University, Malpass warned that there was an increased likelihood of recession in Europe. In addition, China’s growth was slowing sharply and U.S. economic output contracted in the first half of the year. Therefore, the Federal Reserve has a mighty tough job ahead of it, further bolstering the case for recession stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTrue, the Fed remains committed to tackling inflation through raising the benchmark interest rate. At the same time, too aggressive of an approach could lead to high unemployment. Therefore, the uncertainties force closer examination of recession stocks to buy.DGDollar General$240.67DLMAFDollarama$57.41CLColgate-Palmolive$72.54MCDMcDonald’s$235.27LOWLowe’s$191.34ETREntergy$104.88PGRProgressive$117.98Dollar General (DG)Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, middaySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) is a popular dollar store chain. As of April of this year, the company operates 18,216 stores in the continental U.S. Featuring everyday household items at sharply discounted prices, Dollar General easily represents one of the best recession-resistant stocks to buy.While not the greatest performance by itself, DG stock has gained more than 2% since the start of the year, at the time of writing. However, compared to benchmark S&amp;P 500 index, which is down more than 22% during the same period, the resilience of DG implies that it can potentially survive a recessionary shock — or even stagflation.Story continuesAt the moment, DG features a strong buy consensus rating among 17 Wall Street analysts, per TipRanks. Dollar General has an average price target of $276.31, representing 14.7% upside from the time of writing.Per Gurufocus.com, Dollar General features a fairly valued financial profile. Notably, the company enjoys strong profitability metrics, particularly a net margin of nearly 6.6%.Dollarama (DLMAF)Dollarama logo in front of their local shop in downtown Montreal, Quebec.Source: BalkansCat / Shutterstock.comOperating under a similar principle to Dollar General above, Dollarama (OTCMKTS:DLMAF) offers international exposure to investors of recessions stocks. Headquartered in Montreal, Dollarama is a Canadian discount retail chain. It has over 1,400 stores and a presence in every province in Canada.Unsurprisingly, DLMAF has performed well this year, gaining almost 15% at the time of writing. With the U.S. benchmark equity index down in bear market territory, any investor will take that. Fundamentally, Dollarama offers everyday household goods at low prices, making DLMAF an effective name among recession stocks to buy.Currently, the security enjoys a strong buy consensus rating among nine analysts, per TipRanks. DLMAF’s average price target is $64.29, reflecting 11% upside from the close of the Sept. 28 session.To be fair, Gurufocus.com rates DLMAF as modestly overvalued. However, the underlying company does feature excellent growth and profitability metrics. In particular, Dollarama features a net margin of 16%.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comA multinational consumer products company, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) specializes in various household and personal care products. Of course, it’s probably best known for its toothpaste brand Colgate. Considering the relative price inelasticity of the underlying products (i.e., even in an economic downturn, people will still brush their teeth), CL represents one of the best recession stocks to buy.At the moment, Wall Street doesn’t see it that way. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Colgate-Palmolive shares have slipped nearly 15%. Over the trailing month, CL has lost more than 8% of its market value. Still, this framework presents a potential acquisition opportunity for a standout among recession stocks to buy.According to Gurufocus.com, the investment resource labels CL as modestly undervalued. Notably, the underlying firm enjoys robust profitability metrics. For instance, Colgate-Palmolive’s operating margin stands at 20.6%. In contrast, the industry median is 4.7%.Just be warned, though, that covering analysts don’t quite see CL as a buy. Presently, it features a hold rating, although with a $81.50 price target, that implies 12% upside.McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.Source: Tama2u / ShutterstockAn iconic fast-food chain, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) represents American capitalism at its finest. Either way, investors can’t deny that MCD presents a compelling idea for recession stocks to buy. Sure, one doesn’t need to order food from the Golden Arches. However, with its sodium-rich products generating significant cravings, McDonald’s essentially has a hostage audience.Should stagflation become the norm moving forward, investors will need to get their return any way possible. If a little cynicism is thrown into the mix, so be it. At the time of writing, MCD stock is down 12% YTD. Therefore, the market doesn’t quite see the optimistic angle for the fast-food giant. However, if the economy declines, MCD could benefit from the trade-down effect.At the moment, Gurufocus.com labels MCD as fairly valued. The standout financial metrics for the business is profitability, particularly its red-hot net margin of nearly 26%.In addition, MCD features a strong buy consensus rating among 26 analysts. It also has a price target of $281.84, implying 19% upside potential.Lowe’s Companies (LOW)the front of a Lowe's storeSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Mooresville, North Carolina, Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW) specializes in home improvement products. Like its rival Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and others, Lowe’s represents an essential business, thus staying open during the initial onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Undoubtedly, this action helped the country cope with the crisis. Now, with stagflation possibly on the horizon, Lowe’s may be able to benefit consumers again.Fundamentally, the company provides the products that everyone needs. Further, the home repair and maintenance industry is relatively inelastic — recession or not, stuff happens. Therefore, LOW is an ideal name among recession stocks to buy.Enticingly, Gurufocus.com labels Lowe’s as a modestly undervalued business. While the company features an okay balance sheet, it comes alive in the growth and profitability departments. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 16.2%, above the industry median of 2.2%. Also, its net margin is 8.8%, far better than the industry median 2.5%.Entergy (ETR)Entergy sign at their headquarters in New OrleansSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAn integrated energy company, Entergy (NYSE:ETR) primarily focuses on electric power production and retail distribution operations in the southern U.S. Per its website, Entergy “delivers electricity to 3 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.”Fundamentally, utility firms represent one of the best recession stocks to buy. Whether you anticipate a sharp downturn or even stagflation, communities still need access to their electricity. Therefore, the demand profile for Entergy and related businesses is inelastic. Whether prices move up or down, consumer habits generally remain the same.Specific to Entergy, though, the company also organically advantages migration trends. As several news outlets mentioned, Texas ranks as the top destination for millennials.Per Gurufocus.com, ETR rates as fairly valued. One standout metric is its gross margin, which at 41.4% ranks above the industry median of 28.4%. Also, according to TipRanks, Entergy enjoys a moderate buy consensus rating among nine analysts. It features a price target of $130.11, representing 21% upside potential.Progressive (PGR)A white car with the Progressive logo written across the doors in big blue lettersSource: ShutterstockOne of the most relevant recession stocks to buy, Progressive (NYSE:PGR) garners the most attention for its auto insurance business. What I like here is that state governments effectively enforce Progressive’s hostage audience. With the exception of Florida, “every state requires bodily injury liability insurance (BI), while all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., require property damage liability (PD),” according to ValuePenguin.com.Sure enough, PGR is a winner in the charts, gaining nearly 16% YTD. Over the trailing year, PGR gained nearly 31%. To be clear, PGR might not deliver resounding gains from here on out. But it’s likely that it won’t succumb to the pits, again because of its unignorable business.Admittedly, Gurufocus.com labels Progressive as modestly overvalued. However, one bright spot is the company’s excellent growth rate. Over the past three years, it features expansion in the top line of 14.2%, better than the industry median’s 6.8%.According to TipRanks, PGR does have a hold consensus rating. Its price target is $124.57, implying a 5% gain.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

139,56fc26a5-4657-399f-89ac-0c030c1a832f,PLD,2022-10-03,Prologis' (NYSE:PLD) five-year total shareholder returns outpace the underlying earnings growth,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prologis-nyse-pld-five-total-130053320.html,1664715653,STORY,['PLD'],"[It might be of some concern to shareholders to see the Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) share price down 18% in the last month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been respectable. The share price is up 57%, which is better than the market return of 50%.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. Check out our latest analysis for Prologis In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Prologis achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 17% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 10% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Prologis' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Prologis, it has a TSR of 79% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Prologis returned a loss of 18% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 22%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 12% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Prologis better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for Prologis  you should be aware of, and 2 of them are concerning.Prologis is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

142,299ac2fe-5e45-3f28-8714-b7d24acd3a2a,TROW,2022-10-03,15 Biggest Asset Management Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-asset-management-companies-165324649.html,1664729604,STORY,"['BEN', 'BX', 'AMG', 'IVZ', 'TROW', 'BLK']","[In this article, we will take a look at 15 of the biggest asset management companies in the world. If you want to see some more of the world's biggest asset managers, go directly to 5 Biggest Asset Management Companies in the World.An asset management company invests pooled funds for clients. Although hedge funds are perhaps the most famous type of asset management company, there are many different types of asset managers including those that manage mutual funds, ETFs and index funds.Given the volatility due to the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, the first half of 2022 has been challenging for many in the asset management industry. With high inflation, rising interest rates, and other factors, global equity indexes fell 20% and fixed income indexes fell 10% in the first half of the year, marking one of the worst performances for a first half in recent decades.Amid the challenges, the growth of many asset managers have also experienced challenges. In return for managing assets, asset managers often charge a fee in terms of the percentage of the total AUM. If markets go up, total AUM can go up, and the asset manager could benefit from higher revenues and potentially higher EPS.If markets go down substantially, however, AUM could also go down as the organic asset inflows can't fully offset the market declines and asset managers could have a difficult time meeting market expectations. Indeed, the stocks of many asset managers listed in the NYSE or NASDAQ in 2022 have not done as well as many of those companies have missed earnings per share or revenue growth expectations.Despite the challenges, however, many asset managers have experienced periods of volatility and uncertainty before, and the strongest have used those periods to differentiate themselves from competitors and ultimately potentially gain more market share.Despite the volatility in 2022, some asset classes are expected to grow in the long term.In terms of ETFs, for example, there could be a lot of growth in the area. In particular, Blackrock expects global ETF assets under management to increase from $8 trillion in 2020 to $15 trillion in 2025. The expected growth in ETFs is due to more investors adopting ETFs as commission barriers decrease and as more institutional investors are also using fixed income ETFs.Story continuesWith the expected growth in ETFs as well as expected growth in other assets, there is an opportunity for the existing asset managers such as Fidelity Management &amp; Research, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), and Vanguard to grow even bigger in terms of AUM. With bigger AUM, the managers could realize more scale and be more profitable.MethodologyFor this list, we used the rankings of The SWFI and ranked institutions by the total managed AUM. If a company is publicly listed on either the NYSE or NASDAQ, we also included the number of hedge fund holders in our database that also held shares as of Q2 2022.15 Biggest Asset Management Companies in the World 15. Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE:AMG)AUM: $777 billionAffiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE:AMG) is a leading partner to independent active investment management firms around the world.

As of March 31, 2022, the company's AUM was approximately $777 billion.In August, Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank raised his price target to $163 from $154 and kept a 'Buy' rating on shares.Nevertheless, given the decline in the broader markets, shares of Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE:AMG) are down 32% year to date.Among the almost 900 hedge funds in our database, 24 were long on Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE:AMG) at the end of Q2 2022 with Southeastern Asset Management as the top hedge fund holder with over 1.7 million shares.14. Legg MasonAUM: $804 billion With assets under management of $804 billion as of 2020, Legg Mason is one of the largest asset managers in the world. In 2020, however, the company was acquired by Franklin Resources, Inc. (NYSE:BEN) to form a larger firm that could potentially grow faster. Because SWFI includes it as one of the world's largest asset managers by AUM, it is also on our list of 15 Biggest Asset Management Companies in the World.13. Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX)AUM: $880.9 billionBlackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) is an investment firm that invests across alternative asset classes on behalf of institutional investors such as pension funds.

Nevertheless, some analysts are still bullish long term.On August 31, Benjamin Budish of Barclays initiated an 'Overweight' rating and $120 price target on Blackstone Inc.

143,f8fda01e-97b4-3197-8a08-86facff615f8,UPS,2022-10-03,"Is Now The Time To Look At Buying United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-united-120120756.html,1664798480,STORY,['UPS'],"[Let's talk about the popular United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$208 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$162. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether United Parcel Service's current trading price of US$162 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at United Parcel Service’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service Is United Parcel Service Still Cheap?Good news, investors! United Parcel Service is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $268.72, but it is currently trading at US$162 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, United Parcel Service’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of United Parcel Service look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of United Parcel Service, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 8.2%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since UPS is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UPS for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy UPS. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with United Parcel Service, and understanding these should be part of your investment process.If you are no longer interested in United Parcel Service, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

Housing affordability is rapidly declining. The Federal Reserve is deliberately not helping. Big tech names such as Meta are doing hiring freezes.

These reports will provide much-needed insight into the mindset of a consumer who is still being hurt by inflation and is now seeing their 401ks shredded. Does Conagra's frozen food business see a lift from consumers trading down from eating out? How is Constellation's Corona brand doing with restaurant traffic showing more mixed trends of late? Will Levi's — a rare retail winner in 2022 — follow peers VF Corp. and Nike by warning about the holidays? I think all of these reports could be mixed at best, and inject the latest dose of fear into an already nervous market.A Levi's jeans 50% off sale at Vineland Premium Outlets in Orland, Florida. (Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Market Action: With markets down a lot, pay careful attention to how stocks react to bad news. I found it interesting that shares of chipmaker Micron went up the day after it issued sales guidance almost $2 billion below consensus forecasts. If we get more reactions like this, then it would be OK to begin considering a short-term bottom in the markets. Worthwhile to ponder on this front: The forward price-earnings ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is 15.4 times, below the five-year average of 18.6 times and below the 10-year average of 17.1 times according to FactSet.Story continues5 other events to watch for: (1) Who is the first Fed member to signal a pause in rate hikes is not too far out into the distance?

146,7caba2a4-f5de-33d7-8544-b9891cfd218b,TSCO,2022-10-03,Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 86%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tractor-supply-company-nasdaq-tsco-112740328.html,1664796460.0,STORY,['TSCO'],"[A look at the shareholders of Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 86% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Tractor Supply, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Tractor Supply ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Tractor Supply?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Tractor Supply already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Tractor Supply's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Tractor Supply is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 12% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.9% and 4.2% of the stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Tractor SupplyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Tractor Supply Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$111m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  Tractor Supply is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is a bit unpleasant...If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

While these 70 projects won’t give investors an answer regarding The 7 Best Agriculture Stocks to Buy Now, it does reinforce why the agriculture industry is a smart bet for future growth.The 70 projects in this first funding pool include the following:Climate-Smart Agriculture Innovative Finance InitiativeScaling Methane Emissions Reductions and Soil Carbon SequestrationThe Soil Inventory Project Partnership for Impact and DemandThe Grass is Greener on the Other Side: Developing Climate-Smart Beef and Bison Commodities, andTraceable Reforestation for America’s Carbon and TimberAll 70 projects aim to help farmers, academics, agriculture-related companies, and government agencies work together to produce a more efficient, innovative, and climate-friendly industry. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe seven agriculture stocks to buy should all benefit from the investment the Biden Administration and the USDA are making in smart farming. While it will take years to assess the success of these projects, you can invest in these seven agriculture stocks today. ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$84.07CTVACorteva$58.27DEDeere &amp; Co.$342.55TSCOTractor Supply$192.45AGMFederal Agricultural Mortgage$102.46TSNTyson Foods$68.81SMGScotts Miracle-Gro$48.38Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)a picture of farmland during the daytimeSource: ShutterstockThe Des Moines Register reported in mid-September that Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) CEO Juan Luciano made $14.8 million by selling 284,531 shares of the world’s leading producer of human and animal nutrition company.At the time, Luciano exercised options between $33.18 and $40.65 on Sep. 9, netting an extra $2 million on his stock options because the ADM share price had fallen by 12% since. The sale was part of Luciano’s Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. It’s not an indication that he knows something bad about the company. Instead, CEOs, like Luciano have financial obligations requiring them to sell shares for cash. Story continuesAs a company, Archer-Daniels-Midland continues to innovate for the future. On Aug. 17, for example, it announced it was collaborating with New Culture, a company that makes animal-free cheese products that look and feel like the real thing. The partnership gives New Culture the scale necessary to make an indent in the animal-free dairy products industry. Meanwhile, ADM gains access to one of the industry’s most innovative developers of animal-free dairy products. It doesn’t hurt that ADM generates a trailing 12-month operating income of $3.82 billion from $94.36 billion in revenue. ADM is a major player in agriculture. Corteva (CTVA)Closeup Of Small green Agricultural Toy Tractor loading money coins, Icon Farmer Machinery, Agriculture Business Concept (Harvest Finance)Source: Max_555 / Shutterstock.comAgriculture stocks are performing well in 2022. The iShares Global Agriculture Index ETF — listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as COW– is up nearly 2% year-to-date, almost 26% better than the S&amp;P 500. Not surprisingly, Corteva (NYSE:CTVA) is up more than 22% YTD. In March 2021, I suggested Corteva was one of seven safe stocks that wouldn’t bleed your portfolio. I liked the stock because I believed Corteva would do well in 2021 and beyond. After all, agriculture is wise place to put your money. This was despite the threat from activist investor Starboard Value to shake things up. Starboard advocated for the dismissal of CEO Jim Collins in early 2021. While they didn’t get their wish, they did get three of their proposed independent board members added to Corteva’s board in March 2021 as part of the activist investor’s agreement with the company. All three are still on the board. Starboard continues to own more than one million shares of CTVA stock. Of the 25 analysts covering its stock, 17 rate it Buy or Overweight, with a median target price of $70, 22% higher than its current share price. Deere &amp; Co. (DE)Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.Source: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.comIn August 2019, I identified 10 companies using artificial intelligence (AI) to grow their businesses. Deere &amp; Co. (NYSE:DE) was one of the names on my list. “However, starting in 2013, Deere began to plot a vision of the future farm where all the machinery would be autonomously operated with the farmer monitoring everything from his home” I wrote. “Since then, it has evolved to include AI, computer vision, and machine learning. Agriculture is surprisingly well-suited to technology despite its low-tech reputation.”Using AI to save its customers money, Deere was betting farmers would buy newer equipment. Deere stock is up more than 128% since then.Many have a problem with John Deere’s dominance of the farm equipment market and how it got that way, but that’s a story for another day. There’s no denying the company’s size and scale. It is the largest farm equipment company in the world after all. In addition, it also sells more equipment globally than the next two largest competitors combined. It controls 53% of the U.S. market for large tractors and 60% of the U.S. combine market.Its TTM revenue through Q3 2023 is $47.93 billion, with an operating profit of $7.75 billion. That’s an operating margin of 16.2%. CNH Industrial’s (NYSE:CNHI) is 11.4%, 480 basis points lower. Tractor Supply (TSCO)IDEX stock: An electric tractor sits in a field on a sunny day with a wind turbine in the background.Source: Matthew Troke / Shutterstock.comI mentioned the iShares Global Agriculture Index ETF in the Corteva section. One of its top 10 holdings is Tennessee-based specialty retailer Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO), the largest retail farm and ranch store operator in the U.S. However, it targets recreational farmers, not the kind John Deere supplies.I first recommended TSCO for InvestorPlace in September 2014. It was one of 3 Great Stocks to Buy With No Debt and Great Prospects. It’s up 209% in the eight years since 2.5x the S&amp;P 500. Charlie Bilello recently pointed out that TSCO was the third best-performing S&amp;P 500 stock over the past 20 years, up 35,087%.While I don’t know if it can keep up such a blistering pace, it continues to deliver beneficial results. That is, even though, over those 20 years, there’s been at least four different CEOs and two recessions.The current CEO, Hal Lawton was hired away from Macy’s (NYSE:M) in December 2019. Since then, its shares have nearly doubled. In July, Tractor Supply reported Q2 2022 results that included a 5.5% increase in same-store sales and a 10.7% increase in earnings per share. In addition, it raised its 2022 outlook. On the top line, it now expects at least $13.95 billion in revenue, up from its previous guidance of $13.6 billion. On the bottom line, it now expects EPS of at least $9.48, 28 cents higher than its previous guidance.Down 20% YTD, it currently trades at 1.6x sales, right at its five-year average, so it’s not overpriced.Federal Agricultural Mortgage (AGM)Man calculating finances on calculator. Finance. Finance stocks.Source: wutzkohphoto / ShutterstockAffectionately known as Farmer Mac, the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp. (NYSE:AGM) provides low-cost financing to agricultural lenders and those participating in agribusiness. A few highlights from its Q2 2022 presentation suggest it’s an excellent stock to own for the long haul. For example, more than 90% of its revenue is recurring, a figure tech companies would die for. On a cumulative basis, just 0.11% of its Agricultural Finance Mortgage Loans have soured. Lastly, its business continues to grow. Between 2000 and 2021, its outstanding business volume achieved a compound annual growth rate of 10%.Recurring revenue multiplied by rock-solid growth is a recipe for success. I guess that’s why AGM stock’s gained 3,200% since the March 2009 lows during the financial crisis.On page 7 of its presentation, Farmer Mac points out that it has just 6% of the farm sector real estate debt of $302 billion. The mortgage market is a big one, and it intends to keep gobbling up more of it in the years to come. In August, it reported its Q2 2022 results that included adding $1.9 billion of gross business volume ($236 million net growth), a 12% sequential increase in net interest income to $69.4 million, and a core EPS of $2.83, 19% higher sequentially and 2% year-over-year.Yielding 3.71%, get paid to wait for the stock’s next leg up. Tyson Foods (TSN)A package of Tyson Foods (TSN) chicken breasts.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comThe processor of chicken, beef and pork has not done well by shareholders over the past five years. Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) stock is down nearly 3%, more than 47 percentage points worse than the S&amp;P 500.So, why am I including TSN on my list? If nothing else, reversion to the mean suggests Tyson is due for a relief rally. Tyson recently made some organizational changes that will help the company grow. Included in the moves was the announcement that fourth-generation Tyson family member John R. Tyson is the company’s new Chief Financial Officer. Current CFO Stewart Glendinning moves over to Group President, Prepared Foods. The company hopes Glendinning’s financial and operational background will help its Prepared Foods business come into its own — they currently account for 18.1% of revenue and 17.4% of operating income — while John Tyson appears to be in the running to become CEO in the future.Analysts are lukewarm about its stock. Of the 15 covering it, 10 rate it a Hold. However, the average target price is $92.72, 35% higher than where it’s currently trading.Tyson expects 2022 revenues of $53 billion at the midpoint of its guidance. At an operating margin of 9%, it should generate $4.8 billion in operating income for the year.If you’re an income investor, it has an above-average yield of 2.7%, has grown the annual dividend for 10 consecutive years, and averaged a 17.2% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. It’s an excellent stock to own in turbulent times.Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG)A photo of various raw vegetables.Source: monticello/ShutterStock.comIf you bought Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE:SMG) stock at the beginning of 2022, I feel your pain. It’s down more than 70% YTD, and there are still three months left of the year.I would put SMG on your watchlist if you’re an aggressive investor. It hasn’t traded this low since June 2013. If you bought back then and didn’t sell at its all-time high of $180.43 in April 2021, I feel your pain times two.The company’s shares lost 25% in August alone as margins crumbled as retailers reduced inventory levels.However, weighing more heavily on the share price could be the implosion of its Hawthorne Gardening business. Sales fell 63% in Q3 2022 to $154.5 million from $421.9 million a year earlier. Through the third quarter, Hawthorne’s sales were down 50% due to oversupply issues. As a result, it took a $632.4 million impairment charge on its goodwill and intangible assets.To counter the slide, the company announced Project Springboard when it released its third-quarter results in early August. It is intended to return Scotts Miracle-Gro to the level of profitability that shareholders have become accustomed to. Over the past five years, the company’s average gross margin was 32.1%. In Q3 2022, it was 19.9% and 27.5% YTD. It trades at o.67x sales, one-third of its five-year average.

OXY, Hess Corp. HES and Cactus Inc. WHD.Industry: Integrated Oil &amp; Gas - U.S.Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1986888/4-integrated-us-stocks-to-gain-as-oil-price-remains-highOil prices are still highly favorable for upstream business, despite volatilities and uncertainties affecting the energy market. Integrated energy players’ midstream business is also sound since the companies generate stable fee-based revenues from pipeline and storage assets, thereby enhancing the outlook for the Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry.Among the frontrunners in the industry that will possibly make the most of the handsome business scenario are ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum Corp., Hess Corp. and Cactus Inc.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry comprises companies mostly involved in upstream and midstream energy businesses. The upstream operations entail oil and natural gas exploration and production in the prolific shale plays of the United States. The integrated energy companies are also engaged in midstream businesses through gathering and processing facilities along with transportation pipeline networks and storage sites.Overall, the upstream business is positively correlated to oil and gas prices. The produced commodity volumes are then transported through midstream assets, generating stable fee-based revenues. The integrated energy players in the United States also have access to downstream operations wherein the transported oil volumes are converted to finished products, comprising gasoline, natural gas liquids and diesel, through refining activities.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated IndustryOil Price Still High: The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is trading higher than the $80-per-barrel mark, still favorable for exploration and production activities. Possibilities of weak global economic growth, as central banks continue to raise interest rates to combat high inflations, could hurt oil demand. This bearish factor will probably get outweighed by the looming winter, which could increase the demand for heating oil, supporting crude price, at least in the short run.Story continuesStable Fee-Based Revenues: The integrated companies’ midstream business is relatively less exposed to the volatility in commodity prices. This is because the pipeline and storage assets are usually booked by shippers for the long term, securing stable fee-based revenues.Climate Change Position: Integrated players in the United States have recognized climate change as a serious risk that needs to be addressed. The companies are now focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and flaring rates.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish OutlookThe Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry is a 10-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #96, which places it in the top 38% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry has surpassed the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has risen 49.1% over this period against the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 15.7% and the broader sector’s growth of 16.7%.Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, the industry is currently trading at 4.12X, lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 11.42X. It is, however, higher than the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.25X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 13.41X, as low as 3.33X, with a median of 5.84X.4 US Integrated Oil Stocks Moving Ahead of the PackCactus: Cactus has been aiding its clients in fast-tracking their well drilling and completion activities. The company has also been enabling lower operator emissions per barrel of production. Thus, there has been a significantly lower carbon intensity per well. Cactus sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2022 and 2023 over the past 30 days.ConocoPhillips: Considering production and reserves, ConocoPhillips is among the leading upstream energy players in the world. COP is strongly focused on returning capital to shareholders. The energy major has increased its planned 2022 return of capital to $15 billion.ConocoPhillips, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is likely to see earnings growth of 141.9% for 2022.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Hess: Headquartered in New York, Hess is a leading upstream firm with a footprint in Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Guyana. The firm believes that its position in Guyana is strong enough to generate growth in long-term cashflows.For 2022, Hess, carrying a Zacks Rank #3, has seen three upward earnings estimate revisions in the past 60 days.Occidental Petroleum: Headquartered in Houston, TX, Occidental Petroleum is an oil and natural gas explorer with a presence in the midstream energy business. Apart from additional cost-saving measures, it has been capturing acquisition cost synergies, aiding its bottom line.OXY has seen upward earnings estimate revisions for its 2022 bottom line over the past 30 days. Occidental Petroleum, with a Zacks Rank of 3, is likely to see earnings growth of 331.8% for 2022.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Occidental Petroleum OXY, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Hess Corp. HES.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Oil Reclaims $80 After EIA Reports Supply Draw on All FrontsU.S. oil prices bounced back from an eight-month low after government data showed a weekly draw in crude, gasoline and distillate supplies.A decline in stocks across the board together with a falling dollar and supply disruptions from Hurricane Ian saw the commodity rise above $80-a-barrel. However, it remained under pressure from recessionary fears.On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures settled at $81.23 a barrel yesterday. Investors should know that oil slipped to a nine-month low of around $77 earlier in the week — the lowest since January.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Sep 23.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 215,000 barrels compared to expectations of a 300,000-barrel decrease per the analysts. The combination of a surge in exports, lower imports and a dip in domestic production accounted for the stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer even as refinery demand contracted.Total domestic stocks now stand at 430.6 million barrels — 2.9% more than the year-ago figure but 2% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) rose 692,000 barrels to 25.7 million barrels.Story continuesMeanwhile, the crude supply cover increased from 26.7 days in the previous week to 26.9 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 28.2 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies decreased for the second time in three weeks. The 2.4 million-barrel fall was primarily attributable to a surge in demand. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would rise 900,000 barrels. At 212.2 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 4.3% less than the year-earlier level and 6% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) dropped after rising for four weeks in a row. The 2.9 million-barrel fall reflected an uptick in demand and lower production. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply draw of some 100,000 barrels. Despite the recent decreases, current inventories — at 114.4 million barrels — are 11.8% below the year-ago level and 20% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 90.6%, fell 3% from the prior week.Final WordWTI prices recently posted its longest run of weekly losses in 2022 following the Federal Reserve's decision to hike interest rates further in line with many other central banks across the world to step up the fight against soaring inflation. The tightening monetary policies have sparked concerns about a possible recession and, consequently, slowing crude demand. A stronger greenback, which can weaken dollar-denominated commodities like crude, also contributed to the downside.What stands out is that rates may not have peaked yet, and more toughness could be in store for the remainder of this year and 2023. This is because attempts are being made to cool the 40-year high inflation and prevent it from becoming entrenched.However, the U.S. benchmark has regained some ground in the wake of EIA’s bullish inventory report. Prices also drew support from the greenback’s climbdown from a 20-year high, which can strengthen dollar-denominated commodities like crude.As it is, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group (OPEC+) agreeing on a production curtailment, the Oil/Energy market has enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.As a matter of fact, the Energy Select Sector SPDR — an assortment of the largest U.S. companies thronging the space — has risen nearly 31% year to date against a 24% loss for the broader S&amp;P 500 benchmark.Consequently, three of the top five gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum, Marathon Petroleum and Hess Corp.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 114%.

150,cf81a0c0-4b4d-3d37-b311-ac7e974ba83b,OXY,2022-10-03,7 Undervalued Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Before They Rebound,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-undervalued-warren-buffett-stocks-172542463.html,1664472342,STORY,"['AAPL', 'BRK-A', 'GM', 'CVX', 'AMZN', 'OXY', 'BAC']","[Investors who are fans of Warren Buffett may want to look at his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) holdings. The Oracle of Omaha owns companies spanning industries from tech to oil and gas to finance and banking. But which ones are the best value? Let’s take a look at seven of the best undervalued Warren Buffett stocks to buy now — before they rebound and it’s too late.Undervalued Warren Buffett Stocks: Apple (AAPL)Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a record revenue of $83 billion in the third quarter. It earned $1.20 per diluted share. In the quarter, Apple’s product and iPhone unit accounted for $63.36 billion and $40.67 billion in revenue, respectively. Just as PC sales fell in the quarter, so too did Apple’s Mac revenue. Yet that is partly due to supply constraints. Revenue fell from $8.24 billion to $7.38 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsApple expects gross margins of 41.5% to 42.5%. Foreign exchange and product mix are reasons for the decline. Better leverage will offset those headwinds. Inflation is hurting the economy, but Apple did not notice any obvious evidence. For example, the company reported strong iPhone sales. Mac and iPad sales were constrained by supply.In the service sector, the macroeconomic environment hurt digital advertising. Overall, Apple overcame those challenges by posting strong growth. The company reported record growth geographically and across every product category. Customers are more engaged with Apple. This will increase the company’s profitability.Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) already formed a bottom in the low $105 range. AMZN stock has more room to rebound. In the second quarter, the e-commerce firm posted revenue growth of 7.2% year-over-year (YOY) to $121.2 billion. It lost 20 cents a share.Amazon’s revenue is growing below the rate of inflation. Still, its revenue excludes Prime Day sales, which occurred on July 12-13, 2022. Last year’s results included Prime Day.Story continuesAmazon increased its spending by around 40% on warehouses and transportation capacity. When they open up in 2023 and beyond, the company will ship more product volume, increasing its revenue. Operating efficiency will increase for its cloud service, AWS. For example, AWS costs will include depreciation in future quarters.Amazon has new investments and sales force growth across more regions. This increases its infrastructure efficiency. In addition, customers will sign extended contracts at favorable prices. Investors will benefit from more predictable revenue from the AWS unit.Undervalued Warren Buffett Stocks: General Motors (GM)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) reported Q2 earnings per share of $1.14. Revenue grew by 4.6% YOY to $35.76 billion. Supply chain disruptions hurt GM, especially in June 2022. This temporary blip delayed GM stock from rebounding.GM expects a net income of up to $11.2 billion in the fiscal year 2022. It will earn up to $7.50 (dilution-adjusted).Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said that inflation and chip shortages hurt volumes and its product mix in the quarter. He is confident that GM will make up for that volume in the back half of the year. To adjust for a downturn, GM will pause hiring. But it will support the electric vehicle (EV) strategy by adding critical skill hires. As GM removes billions in unnecessary discretionary spending, shareholders should expect efficiencies to pay off.GM will improve its product mix next. For example, it has a new refresh of full-sized trucks. Its SUVs will have strong demand after GM introduced enhancements. Strong demand for vehicles will let GM sell at higher prices. This could lift its profits.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with ""diesel"" and ""food mart"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) posted record-breaking net earnings of $11.62 billion in the last quarter. The EPS of $5.95 is nearly quadruple over last year. The company enjoyed cash flow from operations of $13.8 billion. Free cash flow topped $10.6 billion.Chevron historically grew its dividend for 35 consecutive years. It increased rates by 6% earlier this year. With its strong FCF, the company may increase its investments in traditional and new energy. In the first half of the year, investments rose by 80% compared to last year. In addition, Chevron plans to maintain its strong balance sheet. For five quarters in a row, it has paid down debt. Its net debt ratio of 8% is below its mid-cycle guidance of 20% to 25%.Chevron will increase shareholder returns by buying back $15 billion a stock at an annual rate. This will continue over the next few years, regardless of oil prices potentially falling. Investors should hold CVX stock through the commodity cycle.Undervalued Warren Buffett Stocks: Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is not a high-yield investment. It recently declared a 13-cent per share quarterly dividend. It is prioritizing paying down its debt and buying back shares.OXY stock is nowhere near a peak. The stock said last quarter that it would repay another $5 billion in debt. It already paid back $3.6 billion in debt. Once it achieves the $5 billion debt reduction, it will buy back $3 billion in shares. Investors may infer that Buffet likes Occidental’s shareholder return framework.The company is cautious about the energy market conditions ahead. It expects a slight dampening for the rest of the year. Long-term investors may use any share price weakness to accumulate a position. Long-term fundamentals are supportive of higher margins.Occidental will outperform thanks to strong results from its midstream and marketing units. It reported higher margins from its gas processing and sulfur sales. Furthermore, Occidental optimized its gas transportation activity in the Permian and Rockies.Bank of America (BAC)A photo of the Bank of America (BAC) logo in neon red and blue on a tan wall.Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.comBank of America (NYSE:BAC) posted revenue growing by 5.7% YOY to $22.7 billion. It also declared a quarterly cash dividend of 22 cents a share. The penny increase is a 5% hike. The small dividend raise is restricted by regulatory requirements and the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) Quantitative Results.Ahead of BAC stock rebounding, investors should buy the stock. By next year, the bank will resume its 3-cent per share dividend increase. It will also buy back more shares.The company increased its customer base by adding a million new checking accounts YOY. This is an ideal customer addition, because the product is stable. Customers rarely close the product. As interest rates rise, customers are even less likely to close their accounts.The higher interest rates will add $2 billion to Bank of America’s net interest income. That is $900 million to $1 billion this quarter and again in the next quarter. Since operating costs are consistent at $15 billion to $15.5 billion, the bank will report higher margins.Undervalued Warren Buffett Stocks: VeriSign (VRSN)hands typing on a computer keyboard under a computer screenSource: ShutterstockVeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN) manages domain name registrations. Its mission is to enable the world to connect online. In the second quarter, the company achieved a milestone of 25 years of 100% availability in the dot-com and dot-net domain name resolution system.In the second quarter, VeriSign posted revenue growth of 6.8% to $352 million. It earned $1.54 a share. Domain name registrations are trending lower. Investors should expect a fall after a pandemic-driven increase in registrations. Still, the company has favorable long-term trends. CEO James Bidzos said that new registrations are looking more similar to pre-pandemic levels.VeriSign has a strong recurring revenue trend. It saw continued strong renewal rates for past renewed names. This rate is typically in the mid-80% range. Customers that registered during the pandemic are renewing their names. This will strengthen VeriSign’s core renewal business.For five years, the company did not raise prices. After studying the market, it determined it could hike prices. The next price increase will take effect on Feb. 1, 2023.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) shareholders have enjoyed a 87% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 35% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 61% in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Vertex Pharmaceuticals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 64% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 61% in the last twelve months. That's better than the annualised return of 13% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Vertex Pharmaceuticals that you should be aware of before investing here.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The Zacks analyst believes that lower realized prices in the United States, loss of exclusivity for products and stiff competition are affecting the company's sales. Sales are also being negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The supply challenges for Wegovy have impacted the stock. The patent expiry on some of the products in Novo Nordisk’s portfolio remains a woe.However, the promising diabetes drug, Ozempic, is off to a solid start since its launch. The drug remains the growth engine for the company. The launch of Rybelsus also looks impressive. Novo Nordisk has one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry.

154,f24691fe-9761-354b-a36a-5df8e8ff0378,KO,2022-10-03,"Zacks.com featured highlights include Coca-Cola, General Dynamics, AstraZeneca, Boise Cascade and Insperity",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-com-featured-highlights-coca-083008400.html,1664785808,STORY,"['GD', 'BCC', 'NSP', 'AZN', 'KO']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 3, 2022 – Stocks in this week’s article are The Coca-Cola Co. KO, General Dynamics Corp. GD, AstraZeneca plc AZN, Boise Cascade BCC and Insperity Inc. NSP.5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Beat Market VolatilityThe year 2022 has been roiled by huge volatility and uncertainty, which have raised the appeal of dividend investing. Dividend stocks are major sources of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk even though these do not offer dramatic price appreciation.In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — The Coca-Cola Co., General Dynamics Corp., AstraZeneca plc, Boise Cascade and Insperity Inc. — that could be compelling picks amid market volatility.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation than simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Story continuesHere are the five of the 17 stocks that fit the bill:Georgia-based Coca-Cola, a beverage company, manufactures, markets, and sells various nonalcoholic beverages worldwide. The company provides sparkling soft drinks; flavored and enhanced water, and sports drinks; juice, dairy, and plant–based beverages; tea and coffee; and energy drinks.

(NYSE:WM), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 81% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$66b last week. However, the 8.6% one-year return to shareholders may have helped lessen their pain. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Waste Management, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Waste Management?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Waste Management. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Waste Management, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Waste Management. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.5% and 4.5% of the stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Waste ManagementWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Waste Management, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$116m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Waste Management better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Waste Management  that you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Insiders invest with the hopes of seeing their money grow in value over time. However, as a result of recent losses, their initial investment is now only worth US$4.7m, which is not what they expected.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric General Electric Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Chairman &amp; CEO H. Culp bought US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$75.26 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$61.91 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when insiders have purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 75.54k shares worth US$5.7m. On the other hand they divested 1.44k shares, for US$107k. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by General Electric insiders.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that General Electric insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$165m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About General Electric Insiders?The fact that there have been no General Electric insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us.

Insiders might have been better off holding onto their shares, given that the average selling price of US$114 is still below the current share price.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Progressive Progressive Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President of Personal Lines, Patrick Callahan, for US$2.4m worth of shares, at about US$126 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$116. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).In the last year Progressive insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Progressive Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Progressive. In total, President of Personal Lines Patrick Callahan dumped US$2.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider Ownership Of ProgressiveMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Progressive insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$237m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Progressive Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Progressive stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

However, a new source of anxiety now appears on the horizon: stagflation.Per NerdWallet, stagflation represents higher consumer costs merging with rising unemployment and little, if any, economic growth. Recently, World Bank President David Malpass stated that it could take years for global energy production to diversify away from Russian hydrocarbons, according to Reuters. Unfortunately, this dynamic prolongs the risk of stagflation, thus necessitating a search for recession-resistant stocks to buy.During a speech at Stanford University, Malpass warned that there was an increased likelihood of recession in Europe. In addition, China’s growth was slowing sharply and U.S. economic output contracted in the first half of the year. Therefore, the Federal Reserve has a mighty tough job ahead of it, further bolstering the case for recession stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTrue, the Fed remains committed to tackling inflation through raising the benchmark interest rate. At the same time, too aggressive of an approach could lead to high unemployment. Therefore, the uncertainties force closer examination of recession stocks to buy.DGDollar General$240.67DLMAFDollarama$57.41CLColgate-Palmolive$72.54MCDMcDonald’s$235.27LOWLowe’s$191.34ETREntergy$104.88PGRProgressive$117.98Dollar General (DG)Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, middaySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) is a popular dollar store chain. As of April of this year, the company operates 18,216 stores in the continental U.S. Featuring everyday household items at sharply discounted prices, Dollar General easily represents one of the best recession-resistant stocks to buy.While not the greatest performance by itself, DG stock has gained more than 2% since the start of the year, at the time of writing. However, compared to benchmark S&amp;P 500 index, which is down more than 22% during the same period, the resilience of DG implies that it can potentially survive a recessionary shock — or even stagflation.Story continuesAt the moment, DG features a strong buy consensus rating among 17 Wall Street analysts, per TipRanks. Dollar General has an average price target of $276.31, representing 14.7% upside from the time of writing.Per Gurufocus.com, Dollar General features a fairly valued financial profile. Notably, the company enjoys strong profitability metrics, particularly a net margin of nearly 6.6%.Dollarama (DLMAF)Dollarama logo in front of their local shop in downtown Montreal, Quebec.Source: BalkansCat / Shutterstock.comOperating under a similar principle to Dollar General above, Dollarama (OTCMKTS:DLMAF) offers international exposure to investors of recessions stocks. Headquartered in Montreal, Dollarama is a Canadian discount retail chain. It has over 1,400 stores and a presence in every province in Canada.Unsurprisingly, DLMAF has performed well this year, gaining almost 15% at the time of writing. With the U.S. benchmark equity index down in bear market territory, any investor will take that. Fundamentally, Dollarama offers everyday household goods at low prices, making DLMAF an effective name among recession stocks to buy.Currently, the security enjoys a strong buy consensus rating among nine analysts, per TipRanks. DLMAF’s average price target is $64.29, reflecting 11% upside from the close of the Sept. 28 session.To be fair, Gurufocus.com rates DLMAF as modestly overvalued. However, the underlying company does feature excellent growth and profitability metrics. In particular, Dollarama features a net margin of 16%.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comA multinational consumer products company, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) specializes in various household and personal care products. Of course, it’s probably best known for its toothpaste brand Colgate. Considering the relative price inelasticity of the underlying products (i.e., even in an economic downturn, people will still brush their teeth), CL represents one of the best recession stocks to buy.At the moment, Wall Street doesn’t see it that way. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Colgate-Palmolive shares have slipped nearly 15%. Over the trailing month, CL has lost more than 8% of its market value. Still, this framework presents a potential acquisition opportunity for a standout among recession stocks to buy.According to Gurufocus.com, the investment resource labels CL as modestly undervalued. Notably, the underlying firm enjoys robust profitability metrics. For instance, Colgate-Palmolive’s operating margin stands at 20.6%. In contrast, the industry median is 4.7%.Just be warned, though, that covering analysts don’t quite see CL as a buy. Presently, it features a hold rating, although with a $81.50 price target, that implies 12% upside.McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.Source: Tama2u / ShutterstockAn iconic fast-food chain, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) represents American capitalism at its finest. Either way, investors can’t deny that MCD presents a compelling idea for recession stocks to buy. Sure, one doesn’t need to order food from the Golden Arches. However, with its sodium-rich products generating significant cravings, McDonald’s essentially has a hostage audience.Should stagflation become the norm moving forward, investors will need to get their return any way possible. If a little cynicism is thrown into the mix, so be it. At the time of writing, MCD stock is down 12% YTD. Therefore, the market doesn’t quite see the optimistic angle for the fast-food giant. However, if the economy declines, MCD could benefit from the trade-down effect.At the moment, Gurufocus.com labels MCD as fairly valued. The standout financial metrics for the business is profitability, particularly its red-hot net margin of nearly 26%.In addition, MCD features a strong buy consensus rating among 26 analysts. It also has a price target of $281.84, implying 19% upside potential.Lowe’s Companies (LOW)the front of a Lowe's storeSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Mooresville, North Carolina, Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW) specializes in home improvement products. Like its rival Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and others, Lowe’s represents an essential business, thus staying open during the initial onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Undoubtedly, this action helped the country cope with the crisis. Now, with stagflation possibly on the horizon, Lowe’s may be able to benefit consumers again.Fundamentally, the company provides the products that everyone needs. Further, the home repair and maintenance industry is relatively inelastic — recession or not, stuff happens. Therefore, LOW is an ideal name among recession stocks to buy.Enticingly, Gurufocus.com labels Lowe’s as a modestly undervalued business. While the company features an okay balance sheet, it comes alive in the growth and profitability departments. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 16.2%, above the industry median of 2.2%. Also, its net margin is 8.8%, far better than the industry median 2.5%.Entergy (ETR)Entergy sign at their headquarters in New OrleansSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAn integrated energy company, Entergy (NYSE:ETR) primarily focuses on electric power production and retail distribution operations in the southern U.S. Per its website, Entergy “delivers electricity to 3 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.”Fundamentally, utility firms represent one of the best recession stocks to buy. Whether you anticipate a sharp downturn or even stagflation, communities still need access to their electricity. Therefore, the demand profile for Entergy and related businesses is inelastic. Whether prices move up or down, consumer habits generally remain the same.Specific to Entergy, though, the company also organically advantages migration trends. As several news outlets mentioned, Texas ranks as the top destination for millennials.Per Gurufocus.com, ETR rates as fairly valued. One standout metric is its gross margin, which at 41.4% ranks above the industry median of 28.4%. Also, according to TipRanks, Entergy enjoys a moderate buy consensus rating among nine analysts. It features a price target of $130.11, representing 21% upside potential.Progressive (PGR)A white car with the Progressive logo written across the doors in big blue lettersSource: ShutterstockOne of the most relevant recession stocks to buy, Progressive (NYSE:PGR) garners the most attention for its auto insurance business. What I like here is that state governments effectively enforce Progressive’s hostage audience. With the exception of Florida, “every state requires bodily injury liability insurance (BI), while all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., require property damage liability (PD),” according to ValuePenguin.com.Sure enough, PGR is a winner in the charts, gaining nearly 16% YTD. Over the trailing year, PGR gained nearly 31%. To be clear, PGR might not deliver resounding gains from here on out. But it’s likely that it won’t succumb to the pits, again because of its unignorable business.Admittedly, Gurufocus.com labels Progressive as modestly overvalued. However, one bright spot is the company’s excellent growth rate. Over the past three years, it features expansion in the top line of 14.2%, better than the industry median’s 6.8%.According to TipRanks, PGR does have a hold consensus rating. Its price target is $124.57, implying a 5% gain.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NASDAQ:ADP)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-automatic-data-140056806.html,1664719256,STORY,['ADP'],"[How far off is Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.27bUS$4.56bUS$5.44bUS$5.01bUS$5.31bUS$5.47bUS$5.62bUS$5.76bUS$5.90bUS$6.03bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.09%Est @ 2.74%Est @ 2.5%Est @ 2.33%Est @ 2.22% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$4.0kUS$4.0kUS$4.5kUS$3.9kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6kUS$3.4kUS$3.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.0b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.2%– 1.9%) = US$143bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$143b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$78bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$117b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$226, the company appears about fair value at a 19% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Automatic Data Processing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.011. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be looking at the top tech stocks to buy for the fourth quarter.Yeah, the sector is taking a beating, and that’s best reflected in some of the major exchange traded funds that hold tech stocks. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK) is down 28% so far this year. The Invesco QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) suffered a similar fate, down 29%. And the much-vaunted ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) dropped a whopping 57%.Much of the blame rests on the economy – inflation is at its highest since the 1980s and the Federal Reserve is doggedly raising interest rates in an effort to force prices down – even at the risk of running the economy into a recession.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe sector recently had its worst two-week stretch since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic as the Fed hiked rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point.On top of that, tech companies that rely heavily on imports are being hurt by a stronger U.S. dollar because U.S. products are more expensive overseas.While this all sounds like doom and gloom on the surface, it’s also an indication that tech stocks are on sale – and there are some amazing bargains to be had for long-term investors.Here are seven top tech stocks to buy now that all have strong buy signals in my Portfolio Grader.ADPAutomatic Data Processing$226.16EXLSExlService Holdings$145.08 SWCHSwitch$33.87DPSIDecisionPoint Systems$7.25QLYSQualys$141.12PSNParsons Corporation$39.05WOLFWolfspeed$103.60Automatic Data Processing (ADP)In this photo illustration the stock market information of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. displays on a smartphone with the logo of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP stock.Source: IgorGolovniov / ShutterstockMany people are probably acquainted with Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) from their payrolls. The company handles human resources management and software, meaning that it processes paychecks, handles withholdings and other human resources functions.But as an investment, ADP is even more interesting. The company has a stable income flow of recurring revenue because it charges its clients monthly fees.Story continuesEarnings for its fiscal Q4 2022 included revenue of $4.13 billion and earnings per share of $1.50 – both which beat analysts’ expectations. It forecast fiscal 2023 revenue to increase by 7% to 9%, and for EPS to grow by 13% to 16% in fiscal 2023.On top of that, ADP stock boasts a dividend yield of nearly 2%.The stock is down only 6% on the year – much better than most tech stocks – and has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.ExlService Holdings (EXLS)Image representing the U.S. Digital Dollar.Source: Marie Shearin Images / Shutterstock.comIf tech stocks are truly in a bear market, someone forgot to tell ExlService Holdings (NASDAQ:EXLS). The holding company for EXL Services is actually up by nearly 3% on the year.EXL Service is an analytics and digital services company. It works in the insurance, financial, healthcare and media sectors, among others. It does bill collection, legal services, customer service and accounting.Second quarter earnings included revenue of $346.78 million, which beat analyst expectations of $329.68 million. EPS of $1.50 per share was better than the Street’s prediction of $1.32.While EXLS stock pulled back in recent days, it’s still dramatically outperforming other tech stocks, and it has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Switch (SWCH)An image of a hand holding a phone with a cloud on the screen, icons above the phone; controller, music note, camera, plane, shopping cart, home, magnifying glassSource: La1n/ShutterstockMore and more people are working remotely these days. This trend, which started out of necessity during the coronavirus pandemic, is turning into an ideal way to work for many employees.The new reality means that companies will have to have quality data centers and internet infrastructure. And that’s where Switch (NYSE:SWCH) comes in.The company has more than 700 issued and pending patents for data center designs that house storage systems, services and routers.Second-quarter earnings included revenue of $168.19 million and EPS of $1.51 per share – both of which beat analysts’ expectations of $166.78 million in revenue and $1.46 EPS.SWCH stock is up a whopping 18% so far this year, helping it earn an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.DecisionPoint Systems (DPSI)Close up of phone with creative forex chart on blue background.

Tech Stocks to Buy Before the Bull Market ReturnsSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.comAnother great IT services company is DecisionPoint Systems (NYSEAMERICAN:DPSI), a small company that doesn’t even trade on the major indices. In fact, it didn’t even start trading publicly until May.But you can still make plenty of money with DPSI stock. Despite at one point trading as low as $3.40,  DPSI stock is up 12% over the last month. Revenue of $27.51 million in Q2 easily topped analysts’ expectations and was 81% better than a year ago.You can expect some volatility and growing pains with a company as small as DecisionPoint. But even early in its publicly traded life, DPSI is building an impressive track record. It has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Qualys (QLYS)A Qualys sign hanging on a corporate office in Silicon Valley.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comYou may have heard about software-as-a-service (SaaS), which is a growing trend for individual computer users as well as companies. After all, why buy a software license (or hundreds of them, if you’re a big company) and install it on each computer when you can simply by a software subscription online and have it hosted in the cloud?That’s what Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS) does. It provides vulnerability management solutions for servers, networked devices, printers and workstations. The company boasts 10,000 customers in 130 countries.Q2 earnings included revenue of $119.89 million versus expectations of $117.53 million, and EPS of 89 cents versus expectations of 79 cents. QLYS stock is down about 6% so far on the year, but that’s still better than most top tech stocks.Qualys has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Parsons Corporation (PSN)An image of a keyhole shape filled with computer code; cybersecurity; cyber stocksSource: SWEviL / ShutterstockThere are all sorts of flavors when it comes to top tech stocks. One that’s a little out of the box is Virginia-based Parsons Corporation (NYSE:PSN), which specializes in working with defense, intelligence, security and infrastructure engineering.Parsons provides engineering and management support for missile defense systems for the U.S. and its allies. It is known for manufacturing bases for Titan and Minuteman missile systems.With defense spending in the U.S. continuing to increase and tensions with Russia at its highest in a generation, defense stocks are continuing to flourish. And Parsons, with its tie-in to the defense industry, is one of the rare tech companies that is having an extraordinarily good year. PSN stock is up 19% in 2022.Revenue for Q2 was $1.01 billion versus analysts’ expectations for $930.97 million. EPS of 41 cents per share met the Street’s view.PSN stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Wolfspeed (WOLF)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockIf you’re unfamiliar with Wolfspeed (NYSE:WOLF) you wouldn’t be alone. The company was founded as Cree in 1987, but changed its name to Wolfspeed just last year.Now it’s a recognized leader in silicon carbide products and it manufactures wide bandgap semiconductors that are used in everything from electric vehicles, wireless systems, power inverters and supplies, and in 5G applications. As an energy-related tech stock, its products are designed to increase the efficiency of power systems.Earnings for fiscal Q4 2022 included revenue of $228.5 million, which beat analysts expectations of $207,.58 million. The company reported a loss per share of 2 cents, but that was better than the loss of 10 cents per share that analysts expected for the quarter.WOLF stock has had an up-and-down 2022 but is basically flat for the year.

The pandemic caused unprecedented changes in people’s daily lives and working habits. Some categories of real estate investment trusts (REITs) benefitted from these adjustments. Sub-sectors such as data centers and industrial warehouses enjoyed a surge in demand during the pandemic period.Many categories of real estate, however, did not fare so well. One category that has taken a great deal of heat is malls and shopping centers. The past two years have seen a tremendous move toward e-commerce instead of brick and mortar retail. Offices are another category of real estate stocks facing problems. Workers are returning to the office little by little. But telecommuting is here to stay for many roles, and still more firms are adopting hybrid work models that require less-expensive office space. Office REITs are struggling to adapt to this change.It’s not just offices and shopping mall real estate stocks that are struggling, either. The huge rise in interest rates and change in credit market conditions are creating problems for several other REIT subsectors. Investors should be particularly careful with these seven real estate stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSPGSimon Property Group$89.13MACMacerich$7.99IIPRInnovative Industrial Properties$88.09GNLGlobal Net Lease$10.31OPIOffice Properties Trust$13.54SKTTanger Factory Outlets$13.59MPWMedical Properties Trust$11.44Simon Property Group (SPG)building facade of simon property group (SPG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA niche has developed on YouTube of folks videoing old malls in various states of decline. They range from malls that are still in operation with mostly empty hallways, to completely closed and abandoned ones. People have taken to viewing these “dead mall” videos, sometimes nostalgically, to remember a time when these buildings were still centers of commerce and social activity.Not all malls are dead malls, of course. But an increasing number are. A 2020 report suggested that 25% of America’s remaining 1,000 malls would shutter within the next 3-5 years. The collapse of formerly key department stores such as Sears and JC Penney has hastened this decline as malls are left without the anchor tenants these companies once provided.Story continuesSimon Property (NYSE:SPG) has some of the nation’s best malls. It has also been aggressive in diversifying into outlets and foreign real estate. Still, this company is fighting the inexorable decline of its core asset group. Simon made it through the pandemic in one piece, but the long-term outlook is cloudy at best. And given current inflation and the possibility of an economic slowdown, both shoppers and retailers may be in a tough spot this holiday season.Macerich (MAC)a person standing in a shopping mall with a bag in their hand. May CPI data.Source: ShutterstockMacerich (NYSE:MAC) is another shopping mall REIT. The company has traditionally focused on high-end shopping malls. This trust’s focus on luxury has insulated its malls, to an extent. While the middle class mall of old anchored by JC Penney and Sears is not a viable model nowadays, high-end malls are still hanging on.Unfortunately for real estate stocks in this space, massive capital costs are required to build and maintain its luxury malls. While business is still okay at Macerich’s properties, rents simply haven’t gone up fast enough to provide much profit. In the late 2010s, MAC stock had already plunged from $50 to $20 as investors noted the darkening outlook for the company.The pandemic accelerated this trend; MAC stock fell to $6 in 2020 and the company’s dividend was slashed. It’s easy to blame Covid-19 for the company’s problems. But the truth is that Macerich has a ton of debt and would have had a challenging future regardless. Between the lingering effects of the past two years and now sharply higher interest rates and a weakening economic situation, Macerich shares seem destined to slump below their prior lows.Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)stocks to buy: warehouse interior with shelves, pallets and boxes DSource: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.comInnovative Industrial Properties (NASDAQ:IIPR) is a specialty REIT focused on cannabis. Specifically, Innovative Industrial buys greenhouses and cannabis cultivation properties ,and then rents them out to marijuana growers.Originally, this was a great business model due to a specific quirk. Cannabis remains illegal on a federal level, and thus banks typically won’t lend to marijuana companies. This lack of capital can make it prohibitive for cannabis companies to finance their production facilites.Innovative Industrial came up with the solution. It raised funds from investors and then uses those to finance the cultivation companies. At first, Innovative Industrial was the only game in town and earned massive returns on its invested capital. However, competition has surged into the arena as more REITs and specialty lenders go after the same market.Meanwhile, some of Innovative’s tenants are running into trouble. The downside of earning 20% on your capital, after, all, is that the tenant may not be able to afford such punitive rents. Major tenant King’s Garden defaulted earlier this summer, sending IIPR stock down double digits. More tenants appear to be a on a weak financial footing. And to add to the headache, if and when marijuana is legalized nationally, banks will be able to lend to cannabis farmers directly, making Innovative’s future much less certain.Global Net Lease (GNL)A paper cutout of a house is attached to a tag reading ""for rent.""Source: Pixelbliss / Shutterstock.comGlobal Net Lease (NYSE:GNL) is a REIT focused on net lease properties in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Triple net lease is a type of real estate transaction that involves leading a building to a tenant, where the tenant covers major operating expenses.Triple net leases are historically a solid-performing category of the REIT category. Accordingly, many investors like Global Net Lease’s business model overall. However, the firm has always struggled to achieve the same level of success as rivals such as Realty Income (NYSE:O). Thanks to this, Global Net Lease has a high cost of capital, meaning it has to pay more to get funds from investors for new properties.This has led to Global Net Lease diluting its shareholder base considerably while offering an unusually high dividend yield. This worked out alright prior to 2020, but now the firm’s weaker balance sheet is catching up to it. The firm’s European exposure is largely in the United Kingdom. There, a fiscal crisis has sent the value of the British Pound plummeting and will impact Global Net Lease’s revenues from that market. Right now, GNL stock is yielding 14%. Investors might think that’s a great deal. But, more likely, Global Net will not be able to maintain its current payout, and thus will have to reduce its dividend.Office Properties Trust (OPI)Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room.Source: GaudiLab / ShutterstockOffice Properties Trust (NASDAQ:OPI) is one of the smaller struggling real estate stocks which, like Global Net Lease, seems likely to cut its dividend going forward. Office Properties Trust shares currently offer an eye-popping 15% dividend yield. That might seem like a great offer for retirees and income-seeking investors.However, Office Properties Trust gets its income from offices. It doesn’t own the top offices in a given market, either. It owns cheaper properties that historically attracted significant interest from tenants looking for a more affordable office lease.Now, however, companies can pick whatever office they want for new leases, given the low occupancy rates across the industry. Long story short, unless you own the newest, most modern, and most glamorous offices in a market, it’s going to be rough sailing getting new tenants. Investors buying OPI stock for the 15% yield are looking at the past, when Office Properties Trust had a stable business outlook. Now, however, the company will likely have to accept much lower rates for its buildings going forward, leading to a major dividend cut.Tanger Factory Outlets (SKT)Tanger Outlets (SKT) sign over a buildingSource: Ritu Manoj Jethani / Shutterstock.comTanger Factory Outlets (NYSE:SKT) is a shopping center REIT focused on outlets. The outlet center model was a great template for real estate stocks 20 years ago. Operators such as Tanger or Simon would build a major shopping destination in a tourist area or along a major highway in between two big cities. People would go to the outlet center and get bargains that weren’t available at shopping malls or in downtown shopping areas. The thinking was that outlets gave retailers an alternative venue to clear out certain kinds of products, while giving shoppers a fun and novel bargain-hunting experience.It’s far from certain that outlets make much sense in 2022, however. The internet has made it easy to go bargain-shopping without ever leaving your home. Meanwhile, discount retailers like Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) set up shop within major cities, making it possible to get the experience without having to drive to a far-away outlet center.Tanger remains focused on its outlet business and hasn’t made serious efforts to pivot the business. Like Macerich, Tanger’s financial results were poor prior to the pandemic with the company consistently reporting flat-to-slightly-down financial results in the late 2010s. Now, things have gone from bad to worse for the REIT in the post-2020 landscape. Tanger may hang on for a little while longer, but the long-term prognosis for both Tanger and the outlet shopping experience seem grim.Medical Properties Trust (MPW)Blurred hospital images, Patient bed in the hospital, Hospital cleaning, Hospital disinfection cleaning, Patient bed cleaning for emergency patients. Medical Properties Trust (MPW)Source: venusvi / Shutterstock.comMedical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW) is a REIT focused on ownership of hospitals. The firm has gone on a tremendous buying spree, acquiring hospitals left and right. Unfortunately, it has run into trouble as its largest tenant, Steward Health Care Systems, has lost $800 million in recent years. Medical Properties Trust has seemingly had to step in and lend large sums of money to Steward and its CEO directly to keep the struggling hospital system going. As Steward made up 30% of Medical Properties Trust’s revenues in 2020, any default here could be devastating.Short sellers have been hounding MPW stock all year, and with good reason. Shares continue to slide, and the trust’s now-9% dividend yield seems increasingly tenuous.Adding to the above point, there has been huge trading in put options on Medical Properties Trust, specifically for its October 2021 options expiry. On one day alone, last week, more than 40,000 put options changed hands. This is tremendous volume for a small and relatively under-the-radar REIT, suggesting that someone is making a big bet on bad news about a tenant or possible dividend cut in the near future.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Union Pacific's current trading price of US$195 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Union Pacific’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific Is Union Pacific Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Union Pacific is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $301.02, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Union Pacific’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Union Pacific?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 24% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Union Pacific. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since UNP is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UNP for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy UNP. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.
