Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments How Fast Is Texas Instruments Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that Texas Instruments has managed to grow EPS by 19% per year over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Texas Instruments shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 45% to 53%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Texas Instruments' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre Texas Instruments Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Texas Instruments, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$160m. We note that this amounts to 0.1% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Texas Instruments but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add Texas Instruments To Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Texas Instruments' strong EPS growth. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. Before you take the next step you should know about the 3 warning signs for Texas Instruments (2 are potentially serious!) that we have uncovered.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

While 2021 saw big selloffs in weaker companies, 2022 has seen nearly universal selling across the growth stock sector.Many investors are understandably throwing in the towel on growth stocks. After such a bad run, people are rightly questioning many of the grand narratives that drove the previous bull market in the technology sector. On top of that, tailwinds associated with heightened digital adoption during the pandemic have reversed. Now, layoffs and cutbacks are the order of the day across Silicon Valley.However, it’s not all bad news.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn fact, for patient investors, the current chaos represents an opportunity. After seeing growth stocks soar last year, valuations have come back down to earth. The strongest growth stocks can consolidate during this down cycle and come out stronger. Astute investors can capitalize with these seven leading companies going forward.CRMSalesforce$158.75MSFTMicrosoft$238.41VVisa$188.99SNOWSnowflake$178.23DDOGDatadog$84.27SPOTSpotify$89.04TXNTexas Instruments$155.21Salesforce (CRM)A hand with pink painted fingernails holds a Salesforce sticker.Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.comBig software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies have become the latest victims of the ongoing selloff in tech stocks. Shares of leading graphics design company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) plummeted following its surprising and expensive acquisition of design firm Figma. Adobe’s plunge has set off a fresh round of selling in other leading SaaS giants like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).However, Adobe’s problems don’t apply to CRM stock. Salesforce has used more discipline in its big acquisitions; for example, Salesforce paid a reasonable price in acquiring workplace collaboration platform Slack. That Slack purchase was part of Salesforce’s gradual shift from just being a CRM company to one offering a far broader workplace solutions platform.Story continuesSalesforce has had one of the longest streaks of 20% annualized revenue growth on record among large-cap technology companies. The core product is also a sticky one; once enterprises put their key data into Salesforce, it usually stays there. CRM stock is now at 32 times this year’s estimated earnings and 28 times projected 2023 earnings, which is one of the better entry points we’ve seen for Salesforce historically.Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comFor awhile, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) appeared to be immune to the broader market selloff. However, even MSFT stock has now gotten dragged into the mess.MSFT stock has now fallen 15% over the past six months. Microsoft’s cash cow continues to be its dominant position with Windows and Office. However, the Azure cloud computing business has revolutionized Microsoft’s outlook. Azure is already producing more than $40 billion per year in revenues and is still growing at more than 40% per year. It’s simply breathtaking success for a company of Microsoft’s size and age.Right now, Microsoft is selling off on fears that Azure will slow down as its clients pull back on spending. That’s a valid concern. But Microsoft is a cash flow machine. It’s also selling for less than 25 times forward earnings now and earnings are still growing at a double-digit rate. Long story short, Microsoft is still a reliable blue-chip growth stock, and it’s now at its best entry point so far in 2022.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comShares of credit card giant Visa (NYSE:V) are also back near 52-week lows as V stock has slipped below the $200 mark. Traders appear to be selling off Visa shares again due to the macroeconomic environment.In theory, a slowing economy should hurt commerce and slow down velocity on credit card payments. The strong recovery in international tourism — which is vital to Visa’s profit margins — may also slow given mounting inflation and various geopolitical uncertainties this year.However, the negativity is getting out of hand. Visa doesn’t take credit risk; instead, its partner banks are on the hook for any non-payments. Visa gets paid a small cut of every transaction rather than lending money itself. And, it should be noted, with inflation soaring, overall transaction sizes are getting larger and larger, which means Visa’s revenues scale up naturally.There’s also a strong valuation appeal to V stock at today’s prices. In recent years, Visa has often traded around 35 times earnings or at even higher multiples. Now it is selling for less than 27 times forward. Throw in Visa’s earnings growth rate off that discounted starting valuation, and investors should enjoy fantastic returns from this entry point.Snowflake (SNOW)Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.Source: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockSnowflake was one of the market’s most anticipated initial public offerings (IPOs) when its shares debuted in 2020. The company has been growing at an exponential rate in recent years. And it is headed by legendary tech CEO Frank Slootman. All the pieces were there for success. Except for valuation.SNOW stock opened trading at $240 and made it up to $400 not long after. That briefly put shares at nearly 100x trailing revenues. Regardless of how great a business may be, it’s a gamble to buy a company at such a high starting ratio.Now, however, valuation has fallen into place. With SNOW stock under $200 per share, the market capitalization has fallen back to a more reasonable $60 billion. That’s roughly 30x revenues based on the estimated $2 billion of revenues for the current fiscal year. Meanwhile, revenues are still growing at around 50% per year, which is one of the fastest growth rates for a large-cap tech company.The issue with Snowflake was never business quality, but merely overvaluation. And now, after the tech bear market, SNOW stock is much more appropriately priced. This makes it one of the best growth stocks to buy now.Datadog (DDOG)The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.Source: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.comDatadog is a leading provider of monitoring and security services for cloud applications. The service operates across apps, networks, databases, code, workflow, servers and many other locations. In all, Datadog aims to give its customers an all-in-one platform that works everywhere instead of being confined to certain use case silos.Datadog’s platform has been incredibly successful in terms of driving adoption. The company had just $101 million of revenues in 2017. By the end of 2021, it had grown to $1 billion, making for a quick tenfold jump. Analysts see the company’s revenues surging to $2.2 billion for full-year 2023.Unlike many SaaS companies, Datadog has achieved bottom line financial results to complement the top-line growth. It has, for example, put up a 26% free cash flow margin over the past 12 months. The company, while not tremendously profitable, does also consistently earn positive earnings per share which puts it ahead of many rivals. Datadog’s $1.6 billion of cash on hand also ensures that the company won’t need to raise money during these trying market conditions.For a pure fast growth play, Datadog looks like one of the eventual winners once sentiment recovers.Spotify (SPOT)Spotify (SPOT) app on smartphone iPhone 13 Pro screen on green background.Source: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.comStreaming media stocks have gotten hammered over the past 12 months. Video streaming has gone from boom to bust as subscriber numbers roll over. Turns out, as the economy has reopened, demand for home entertainment has cooled. Unfortunately, this fall has hit music as well, with Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) losing the majority of its value over the past year.Unlike video, however, Spotify doesn’t have nearly as existential of a crisis. The competition for the television screen is brutal with a seemingly unending stream of new services undercutting Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Spotify, by contrast, is far and away the market leader in music and has a dominant position, especially in international markets.Spotify still has its issues. It pays out too much in royalties to record labels, which limits profitability. Over time, Spotify should be able to negotiate better royalties, but the market won’t believe it until it actually happens. And so-called streaming fatigue is a factor as well as demand for subscription services has waned following the pandemic.Regardless, Spotify is the clear leader in music, and the market will grow substantially in the long term. Patient investors are getting a solid entry point today.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments is a leader in the semiconductor industry. Specifically, it focuses on analog semiconductors, which are used in a variety of ways to convert real-world inputs such as wind speed or temperature into digital data, along with applications in fields such as audio and power systems.Analog is a great market, since it is more stable and slower-moving than other semiconductor fields. Texas Instruments can sell many of its designs for a decade or more, as opposed to semis for categories such as smartphones where the market changes radically every few years.Texas Instruments is in the sweet spot right now. Analog chips are vital for connected cars, internet of things applications, and other such niches with strong growth trajectories. Management’s focus on maximizing its free cash flow and hiking its dividend have proven shareholder-friendly during a time when so many other tech companies have failed to protect investors. All this makes TXN stock a great growth stock to own even as markets remain chaotic.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in SPOT, TXN, V and CRM stock.

3,b1e18f22-034e-3b26-bd8b-01bf09511840,USB,2022-10-24,"U.S. Bancorp's (NYSE:USB) recent 5.3% pullback adds to one-year year losses, institutional owners may take drastic measures",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bancorps-nyse-usb-recent-130056566.html,1666530056,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[A look at the shareholders of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 68% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$60b last week after a 5.3% drop in the share price. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 33% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. Hence, if weakness in U.S. Bancorp's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about U.S. Bancorp. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.U.S. Bancorp already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see U.S. Bancorp's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. U.S. Bancorp is not owned by hedge funds. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.7% and 6.7% of the stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of U.S. Bancorp in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$83m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 24% stake in U.S. Bancorp. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 8.1% of the U.S. Bancorp shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

5,3359ccdd-c222-3992-bacd-c58ea3bfa48c,WMT,2022-10-24,Here's What To Make Of Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) Decelerating Rates Of Return,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-walmarts-nyse-wmt-decelerating-110048551.html,1666609248,STORY,['WMT'],"[If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Although, when we looked at Walmart (NYSE:WMT), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Walmart:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$24b ÷ (US$247b - US$100b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).So, Walmart has an ROCE of 16%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Consumer Retailing industry average of 8.9% it's much better. See our latest analysis for Walmart roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Walmart compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Walmart's ROCE Trending?Over the past five years, Walmart's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at Walmart in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that Walmart has been paying out a decent 35% of its earnings to shareholders. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesAnother thing to note, Walmart has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 40%. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.What We Can Learn From Walmart's ROCEIn summary, Walmart isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Since the stock has gained an impressive 70% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.If you want to continue researching Walmart, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.While Walmart may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

However, markets rebounded on better-than-expected earnings data and a notion that losses in the week before were caused due to overselling.In fact, as the week drew to a close, a few important Fed officials did an eagerly anticipated u-turn, indicating that conversation must start in the central bank regarding easing monetary policy. Even treasury yields fell on Friday on these comments, capping a week of major gains.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market.

7,ff603d13-14e5-3461-b577-efa3b9525593,RJF,2022-10-24,Weak Investment Banking to Hurt Raymond James (RJF) Q4 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weak-investment-banking-hurt-raymond-102110558.html,1666606870,STORY,"['RJF', 'RJF-PB']","[Raymond James RJF is slated to announce fourth-quarter and fiscal 2022 (ended Sep 30) results on Oct 25, after market close. While quarterly earnings are expected to have witnessed a fall on a year-over-year basis, revenues are likely to have improved.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were adversely impacted by a rise in expenses, disappointing investment banking (IB) performance and higher bank loss provision for credit losses. Yet, higher interest income, a rise in loan demand and past acquisitions acted as tailwinds.Raymond James has a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, the surprise being 8.14%, on average.Raymond James Financial, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRaymond James Financial, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRaymond James Financial, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Raymond James Financial, Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.00, which has moved 1.5% lower over the past seven days. The figure indicates a decline of 2.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.The consensus estimate for sales of $2.73 billion suggests 1.2% year-over-year growth.Factors to Note for Q4Investment Banking Fees: After an extraordinary performance for almost two years, global deal-making activities have come to almost a halt since the start of 2022, with the September quarter being no different. Raging inflation, equity market rout (with all the major indexes in the bear market) and fears of a recession veered companies away from business expansion plans through acquisitions. Thus, both deal volume and total deal value crashed in the quarter under review, because of which Raymond James’ advisory fees are likely to have been hurt.Given the above-mentioned concerns, the equity market performance was disappointing in the to-be-reported quarter and thus, IPOs and follow-up equity issuances dried up. Likewise, bond issuance volumes are likely to have been muted. Thus, RJF’s underwriting fees are expected to have been negatively impacted in the quarter.The consensus estimate for IB fees is pegged at $237 million, suggesting a 34.9% plunge from the previous-year quarter’s reported figure.Trading Revenues: After witnessing a gradual normalization in the second half of last year, trading activities rebounded from March 2022, with the trend continuing in the September-ended quarter. The Russia-Ukraine conflict continued to disrupt supply chains, leading to global ambiguity. Also, fears of an economic slowdown, 40-year-high inflation numbers and rising interest rates worldwide resulted in heightened client activities and increased trading volumes.These factors led to higher volatility in the equity markets and other asset classes, including bonds, commodities and foreign exchange. Thus, Raymond James’ trading revenues are likely to have been decent in the to-be-reported quarter.Interest Income: The overall loan demand was quite impressive in the quarter under review. Thus, driven by loan growth, along with higher interest rates, Raymond James’ interest income is expected to have improved.Expenses: Raymond James consistently hires advisors and invests in franchises. Thus, overall expenses are expected to have risen in the quarter. Also, due to a highly competitive environment, costs might have been elevated.Story continuesManagement ExpectationsThe Private Client Group (PCG) segment results for the fiscal fourth fiscal quarter are likely to be adversely impacted by the expected 11% sequential decline in asset management and related administrative fees.For the fiscal fourth quarter, IB revenues are expected to remain on par with the previous-quarter level. This will, thus, lead to fiscal full-year 2022 IB revenues touching the same level as fiscal 2021.Net interest margin for the fiscal fourth quarter is expected to be 2.7%, reflecting a 30 basis points increase from the average 2.4% reported in the fiscal third quarter.Expenses are expected to keep rising in fiscal 2022 as travel, recognition trips and conferences continue to resume, and there is an increase in investments in technology and people.Driven by the company’s current revenue mix, forward rate curve over the next 12 months, the impact of the TriState deal and the successful implementation of the expense initiative, the company targets a compensation ratio of less than 66%.The company expects to record bank loan loss provisions for credit losses associated with net loan growth in fiscal 2022.Key Development in Q4In July, Raymond James completed the acquisition of SumRidge Partners, LLC. The financial details of the transaction, announced in March, were not disclosed.Jersey City, NJ-based SumRidge is a technology-based “fixed income market maker” specializing in investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, municipal bonds and institutional-preferred securities. Its integration with Raymond James’ Fixed Income Capital Markets will complement “core client-facing business” and add sophisticated trading technologies and risk management tools.Co-founded by Tom O’Brien and Kevin Morano in 2010, SumRidge's current employees will continue to work under them. Both O’Brien and Morano will become senior managing directors.What the Zacks Model PredictsAccording to our proven model, the chances of Raymond James beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are low. This is because it doesn’t the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Raymond James is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks Worth a LookA couple of other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:The Earnings ESP for Trustmark Corporation TRMK is +5.25% and it carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

This compares to earnings of $0.35 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.63%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this regional bank holding company would post earnings of $0.34 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.36, delivering a surprise of 5.88%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Huntington Bancshares , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry, posted revenues of $1.91 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.71%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.7 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Huntington Bancshares shares have lost about 14.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -23.1%.What's Next for Huntington Bancshares?While Huntington Bancshares has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Huntington Bancshares: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

10,bc870d39-4ceb-3cbf-920b-81df7b4894bb,NCLH,2022-10-24,3 Cruise Stocks to Buy for Smooth Sailing Into 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-cruise-stocks-buy-smooth-174900307.html,1666288140,STORY,"['CUK', 'RCL', 'NCLH']","[The cruise industry is working hard to recover from the pandemic, and bookings have been on an upswing lately. The U.S Centers for Disease Control recently lifted Covid 19 related restrictions, which could be a major catalyst in growing bookings in the latter half of the year. Indeed, cruise stocks remain among the highest-leverage plays investors looking to benefit from near-term catalysts can jump on.The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) recently released a statement that over 75% of its member ships have resumed service, with almost all expected back on the seas by late summer. Moreover, it projects passenger metrics to grow past pre-pandemic levels by the conclusion of next year.With cautious optimism, let’s look at three of the largest (and best) cruise stocks to invest in at this time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCCLCarnival$8.04RCLRoyal Caribbean Cruises$47.65NCLHNorwegian Cruise Line$14.31Carnival (CCL)Carnival (CCL) cruise ship on water in front of beach with chairsSource: FlickrCarnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) is the world’s largest cruise operator, and among the best cruise stocks to own right now. With 91 ships across its cruise line banners, Carnival has an overall capacity of over 243,000 berths. That’s massive.The company’s ships have been docked at port for the better of the past couple of years. Accordingly, CCL stock has struggled under the weight of its massive debt load. However, in recent quarters, revenues have started to flow in at an incredible pace, and are likely to continue growing at a robust clip.Revenues in the company’s second and third quarters have grown by 4,702% and 688.5%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, Carnival’s CFO David Bernstein talked about the cruiseliner’s potential to sail past its 2019 EBITDA levels next year with the removal of coronavirus restrictions. Bookings for the full year are likely to be above historical averages, and at considerably higher prices compared to its 2019 results.Story continuesAlso, CCL generated more than $300 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, expecting to narrow down net losses in the upcoming quarters. These forecasts are highly encouraging, considering the seasonality of its business. Despite these positives, CCL stock is trading as if it was going bankrupt.Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL)Serenade of the Seas cruiseSource: NAN728 / Shutterstock.comRoyal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) is another leading cruise line operator with a healthy 25% market share in the sector. Similar to its peers, RCL stock has been pulverized in the markets over the past couple of years. However, its business has bounced back from the pandemic with solid operating results.In its second quarter, the company posted a handsome revenue beat, with revenues skyrocketing from $50.9 million to $2.18 billion as it returned its entire fleet to operation. Moreover, despite posting a hefty loss in the quarter, Royal Caribbean’s management expects it to swing to GAAP profitability in the upcoming quarter.Perhaps one of the biggest advantages for RCL is that the majority of its long-term debt of $17.74 billion is tied to fixed interest rates. Hence, it’s effectively shielded from the effects of the Fed’s rampant rate hikes. Moreover, the company’s aggregate debt load is significantly less than its competitors. This bodes well for its long-term recovery.Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH)NCL, NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE (NCHL) SHIP GETAWAY, 13 July 2017 : Cruise liner Getaway are docked in Port of Sant Petersburg.Source: Nazar Skladanyi / Shutterstock.comNorwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) is another leading cruise line operator specializing in upscale cruising. Moreover, this company operates a world-class fleet, which continuously improves every year.Similar to its peers, NCLH is experiencing a resurgence of sorts. The company recently announced its final move to remove Covid-19 restrictions. It announced the removal of all testing, masking, and vaccination requirements. The removal of restrictions will likely lead to a massive surge in bookings in the upcoming quarters at prices above pre-pandemic levels.Analysts are already forecasting 2023 revenues for the company to reach $8 billion, a $1.5 billion improvement from 2019 levels. Moreover, analysts at UBS assigned a bullish rating to the stock, seeing its earnings per share price surging to $1.55 in 2023 compared to its prior forecast of $1.44. Moreover, UBS assigned a price target of $15, which represents nearly 25% upside from current prices.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Muslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude lost $84.58 a barrel, losing 47 cents, 0.6%. Both benchmarks had fallen by $2 a barrel earlier in the session.Although higher than in August, China's September crude imports of 9.79 million barrels per day were 2% below a year earlier, customs data showed on Monday, as independent refiners curbed throughput amid thin margins and lacklustre demand.""The recent recovery in oil imports faltered in September,"" ANZ analysts said in a note, adding that independent refiners failed to utilise increased quotas as ongoing COVID-related lockdowns weighed on demand.Uncertainty over China's zero-COVID policy and property crisis are undermining the effectiveness of pro-growth measures, ING analysts said in a note, even though third-quarter gross domestic product growth beat expectations.Ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar, which was up again for part of the trading session following another suspected foreign exchange intervention by Japan, also posed problems for oil prices. A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for non-U.S. buyers.""Further dollar strength would weigh on WTI values with a test of our expected downside at the 79.50 mark likely by week’s end,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates.Oil prices regained some ground after data that showed U.S. business activity contracted for a fourth straight month in October, with manufacturers and services firms in a monthly survey of purchasing managers both reporting weaker client demand.Story continuesPOSITIVE SIGNALS&amp;P Global said its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to 47.3 this month from a final reading of 49.5 in September.That weakening could indicate that the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate increases to fight inflation have been working and may persuade it to slow its rate hike policies, a positive signal for fuel demand, said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures group.""The miss on the PMI number is a sign that the economy may be slowing a bit, which turns out to be bullish,"" Flynn said.Brent rose last week despite U.S. President Joe Biden announcing the sale of a remaining 15 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, part of a record 180 million-barrel release that began in May.Biden added that his aim would be to replenish stocks when U.S. crude is around $70 a barrel.But Goldman Sachs said the stocks release was unlikely to have a large impact on prices.""Such a release is likely to have only a modest influence (&lt;$5/bbl) on oil prices"", the bank said in a note.(Adttional reporting by Noah Browning and Florence Tan; Editing by Marguerita Choy, David Holmes and Cynthia Osterman)]"

Ether was recently trading at $1,365, up 3.89% from 24 hours earlier and about where it has stood for weeks. Investors remain nervous about inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty that threatens to cast the global economy into a steep recession.It's generally green across the board as Asia's trading week begins with major altcoins and exchange tokens in the green over the last 24 hours.Meme coins and metaverse majors were the outliers, with Terra's LUNA down 1.1% and dogecoin knockoff SHIB down 0.5%.

But can Texas securities law rule the world? Or can other U.S. states reach long arms into foreign jurisdictions?Officials from securities regulators in Alabama, Kentucky, New Jersey and Texas are targeting the gambling-themed non-fungible token project Slotie, with accusations that it illegally sold tokens to raise capital.Slotie is registered in the former Soviet republic of Georgia.While there are a number of successful online crypto casinos with active player bases, NFT casino projects — which promise a cut of gambling revenue — have so far not really gone anywhere. The Sands Vegas Casino Club pivoted from being a metaverse-style 3D casino to a more traditional online betting operation, using existing online casino infrastructure on the backend.But this is crypto. Scams and misrepresentations abound. Do your own research.What’s more concerning is how state regulators are following in the footsteps of the federal government and doing a supranational flex to exert authority over projects that have no material ties to the U.S.These projects do not actively solicit U.S. residents. Nor are they based in the country, and their staff are foreign nationals. Terraform Labs will be making similar arguments in its court battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that prior case law found in Royalty Network Inc. v. Dishant.com means there wasn’t “purposeful availment” of the U.S. market just because the webpage was available there and the content is in English.(This is separate from Terraform’s case, which it lost, against the SEC that service of Do Kwon, while he was in New York, was valid.)You can’t say supranational or extraterritorial authority of U.S. regulators without mentioning BitMEX. The exchange, run by Arthur Hayes, a loquacious executive who liked to taunt authority, was charged in 2020 with facilitating unregistered trading, and its top brass was separately charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act.Neither the exchange nor its people had a presence in the U.S. The exchange didn’t deal with fiat currency, only bitcoin (it now takes stablecoins). No bank accounts to be examined for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.Eventually, none of this was tested in court because BitMEX settled the case, and Hayes pleaded guilty. The ability for American regulators to enforce their laws globally was never examined.So if the feds have shaky authority that’s yet to be properly examined over regulating international crypto projects, how is it that the states think they can do the same?

This takes the annual payment to 1.1% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Microsoft Microsoft's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Before making this announcement, Microsoft was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 41.9% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 20%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendMicrosoft Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.80 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.72. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that Microsoft has been growing its earnings per share at 24% a year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.Microsoft Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

Returning for its ninth season, the Walgreens Flu Index shows that to date, overall flu activity is more than 10 times higher nationwide when compared to the 2021-2022 flu season and has more than doubled over the past two weeks.This press release features multimedia.

(Photo: Business Wire)""As we head into the fall and winter seasons, our data show significantly higher flu activity early this year when compared to other flu seasons and it’s increasing across the United States, especially in southern cities,"" said Anita Patel, PharmD, vice president, pharmacy services development, Walgreens. ""As we return to pre-pandemic activities and spend more time indoors without a mask or social distancing, we are more vulnerable to respiratory infections. To help reduce the spread of respiratory illnesses this season, the best thing you can do is schedule your annual flu shot and updated COVID-19 booster at Walgreens in one convenient stop.""During the week of Oct. 10, flu activity was the highest in Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi. Several major cities, including New Orleans, Houston and Mobile, Ala. were designated the top ten areas with the most widespread flu activity so far this flu season.A national survey showed many are either unsure or do not plan to get vaccinated against flu during this flu season.1 With rising rates of flu, COVID-19 older and new variants in circulation and other respiratory illnesses, hospitalizations are expected to rise and could result in a strain on the healthcare system.2 To prevent flu and its potentially serious complications, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine by the end of October and before flu begins spreading during the holidays.3 If individuals are unable to get vaccinated until later, the CDC recommends still getting the flu shot because flu activity most commonly peaks in February and can continue through May. It takes about two weeks after the vaccine for antibodies to develop in the body and provide protection against the flu.Story continuesWalgreens makes it easy for the entire family to stay protected from the flu, with pharmacy team members who are specially trained to administer flu immunizations to adults and children ages 3 and up.

Users can search by market or state to see where their geographic area ranks for flu activity in any given week, as well as how current flu activity compares to last season. Through the time lapse feature of the Walgreens Flu Index®, users can see how current flu activity compares to activity from last season. On a weekly basis, Walgreens tracks the incremental change of antiviral medications used to treat influenza across thousands of Walgreens and Duane Reade locations nationwide to create the Walgreens Flu Index®. The index is not intended to illustrate flu severity, but rather, based on this methodology, to show which populations are experiencing the highest incidence of influenza within the United States and Puerto Rico each week.Flu Index® FrequencyThe Walgreens Flu Index® is updated weekly each Tuesday and is available through an online, interactive map, linked here.Behind the MethodologyData for the Walgreens Flu Index ® is analyzed at state and geographic market levels to measure absolute impact and incremental change of antiviral medications on a per store average basis, and does not include markets in which Walgreens has fewer than 10 retail locations. Low-high rankings are designated based on a normal flu season, defined by an average of the last five flu seasons nationwide. For example, red regions on the Walgreens Flu Index® map indicates a much higher than a normal flu season, while green regions indicate a much lower than normal flu season.About WalgreensWalgreens (www.walgreens.com) is included in the United States segment of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

28,e546a39f-3e82-338f-b3e5-da8091e2d3d4,HST,2022-10-24,"Has Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:HST) Impressive Stock Performance Got Anything to Do With Its Fundamentals?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/host-hotels-resorts-inc-nasdaq-132146871.html,1666531306,STORY,['HST'],"[Host Hotels &amp; Resorts' (NASDAQ:HST) stock is up by a considerable 10% over the past month. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Host Hotels &amp; Resorts'  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Host Hotels &amp; Resorts How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Host Hotels &amp; Resorts is:8.4% = US$581m ÷ US$6.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts' Earnings Growth And 8.4% ROEOn the face of it, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts' ROE is not much to talk about. However, the fact that the its ROE is quite higher to the industry average of 6.6% doesn't go unnoticed by us. However, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts' five year net income decline rate was 36%. Remember, the company's ROE is a bit low to begin with, just that it is higher than the industry average. Hence, this goes some way in explaining the shrinking earnings.Story continuesSo, as a next step, we compared Host Hotels &amp; Resorts' performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 11% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Host Hotels &amp; Resorts is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?In spite of a normal three-year median payout ratio of 47% (that is, a retention ratio of 53%), the fact that Host Hotels &amp; Resorts' earnings have shrunk is quite puzzling. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.Moreover, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 51%. However, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts' ROE is predicted to rise to 12% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we do feel that Host Hotels &amp; Resorts has some positive attributes. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a moderate ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

Beginning today, the legacy Schlumberger brand and nearly all of its affiliated brands will become one under the new SLB brand, which introduces a refreshed visual identity, including a new logo for the company—a symbol of where it is today and where it is heading.""Today we face the world’s greatest balancing act—providing reliable, accessible and affordable energy to meet growing demand, while rapidly decarbonizing for a sustainable future,"" said Olivier Le Peuch, chief executive officer, SLB. ""This dual challenge requires a balance of energy affordability, energy security and sustainability. It requires a balance of innovation and decarbonization in the oil and gas industry as well as clean energy solutions. It requires a balanced energy mix for a balanced planet. Our new identity symbolizes SLB's commitment to moving farther and faster in facilitating the world's energy needs today and forging the road ahead for the energy transition. It’s a bold challenge. But the legacy of our people, technology and performance are unmatched, and we are ready to answer this challenge.""Brand evolutionThe SLB brand builds on nearly a century of technology innovation and industrialization expertise in the energy services industry. The company has spent the last three years laying the groundwork for its increasing focus on low- and zero-carbon energy technology solutions while continuing to drive innovation, decarbonization and performance for the oil and gas industry:Story continuesIn 2020, SLB launched its New Energy business to explore partnerships and opportunities in low-carbon and carbon-neutral technologies. This set in motion a years-long journey for the company to expand its role in the new energy future through the development of new technologies and partnerships.In 2021, SLB became the first company in the energy services industry to commit to a net-zero target inclusive of total Scope 3 emissions from the use of its technologies.In tandem with this commitment, SLB introduced a portfolio of Transition Technologies™ with a quantifiable, science-based emissions reduction benefit. One example is SLB’s Zero-Flaring Well Test and Cleanup technique, which has been used by customers to reduce up to 80,000 tons of CO2 emissions—the equivalent of taking nearly 18,000 cars off the road for a year.Earlier this year, the company announced SLB End-to-end Emissions Solutions (SEES), a dedicated business for eliminating methane emissions from oil and gas operations. Methane is an important industry target because its warming effect is 84 times greater than CO2 over a 20-year period and 28 times over a century. SLB recently joined the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative’s ""Aiming for Zero Methane Emissions Initiative"" to support energy companies’ efforts to curb the warming impact of their operational methane emissions.SLB todayLeveraging this progress and guided by its brand promise to drive energy innovation for a balanced planet, SLB will focus on delivering results-driven solutions for its customers in four areas:New energy systems—SLB is focusing on creating and scaling the new energy systems of tomorrow. With its New Energy business evolving to a strategic driver for the company, SLB will continue forging partnerships across various industries to develop technologies across five areas: carbon solutions, hydrogen, geothermal and geoenergy, energy storage and critical minerals. This includes the company’s Celsius Energy business, which reduces the carbon footprint of buildings by making energy accessible from the earth, as well as Genvia, a clean hydrogen technology company formed as a public/private partnership with France’s renewables research agency, CEA, and other partners.Industrial decarbonization—Reducing emissions, particularly from hard-to-abate industries, is critical to achieving net zero targets. SLB is already working to make an impact in this area. Last month, it announced plans to develop a digital sustainability platform that will provide sustainability solutions for hard-to-abate industrial sectors. SLB is also focused on expanding technologies and opportunities for carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS), which is one of the most significant levers for decarbonizing multiple industries.Digital at scale—Digital capabilities continue to grow throughout the energy industry and have become a key performance and efficiency driver. SLB’s customers will be able to use the company’s digital products and services to help meet their sustainability goals by driving transparency, better measurement, more effective planning and much more impactful outcomes with integrity.

(WBD) was the first to adopt the hybrid release trend at the end of 2020, announcing that all of its 2021 films will have a day-and-date release on HBO Max, in addition to a cinematic rollout. The studio kept that promise throughout 2021 with top titles like ""Dune"" and ""The Matrix: Resurrections"" receiving the hybrid treatment.Disney soon followed its competitor's strategy with Marvel's highly anticipated ""Black Widow"" prequel released on Disney+ on July 9, 2021 — the same day as theaters.The decision caused Scarlett Johansson to sue the company over breach of contact. According to Johansson's team, her earnings potential was ""largely"" tied to box office performance, with Marvel promising the movie star that the film would receive a theatrical-only release.The Wall Street Journal estimated that Johansson lost out on over $50 million due to the shift away from an exclusively theatrical release. Disney settled with the actress two months later for a reported $40 million.US actress Scarlett Johansson poses on the red carpet upon arrival at the BAFTA British Academy Film Awards at the Royal Albert Hall in London on February 2, 2020.Although studios have since reverted back to box office exclusives with shortened theatrical windows, Johansson's lawsuit created a momentous ripple effect throughout Hollywood.Story continues""With regards to Scarlett Johansson, I was shortly thereafter negotiating a movie deal and we handled the negotiations completely different in the event that the movie would go straight to streaming,"" Drescher said, revealing that her movie ultimately did end up skipping a theatrical release and, instead, debuted on Amazon Prime Video (AMZN).As a result of her negotiations, influenced by Johansson, Drescher said she recently received a ""big chunky check"" for her work in the film.'We were the underdogs in this equation'SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher speaks during the SAG-AFTRA and NFL Players Association Celebrity brunch to launch the new ""Actors &amp; Athletes: Unions for Democracy"" campaign in Beverly Hills, California, on July 17, 2022.Since that time, SAG-AFTRA — which represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — has worked hand-in-hand with streaming giants to re-negotiate contracts in order to account for the shifting media landscape.""We just had a very successful negotiation with Netflix (NFLX),"" Drescher noted. The contract, which included significant changes benefiting background performers, stunt coordinators and dubbing performers, allows actors more freedom and flexibility to pick up jobs on other platforms.Drescher explained that, when talks first began, the union had suggested making incremental alterations to an existing contract — an approach that the actress passionately disagreed with.""I saw a convergence of opportunities that would probably not come along for a very long time,"" she said, adding that talks needed to be leveraged with a great deal of strength and conviction; otherwise, the union would ""forever be chasing after a different kind of a contract that's always just outside of our grasp.""The union struck a similar deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). The agreement outlined major improvements to ""exclusivity"" rules, which had previously prevented television series regulars on accepting new jobs while on hiatus.It's the journeyman actor, the middle class, that's always getting squeezed...Fran Drescher, SAG-AFTRA President""We were very lucky that they heard us. They understood that we were the underdogs in this equation,"" Drescher said.""The truth of the matter is that when an entire industry changes, and the rules of the game change on behalf of the employer, changes are going to have to trickle down to the employees as well. You can't have it both ways,"" she continued.Drescher emphasized that SAG-AFTRA's negotiations largely focus on ""the journeyman actor"" as A-list stars like Tom Hanks and Scarlett Johansson often make their own deals.""It's the journeyman actor, the middle class, that's always getting squeezed. That's really why unions exist — to protect and defend their rights,"" she stressed.'The gift that keeps on giving'Outside of SAG-AFTRA, Drescher — known for her role as Fran Fine in the popular CBS sitcom ""The Nanny"" — continues to work as an actress and producer.When asked about a potential ""Nanny"" film reboot, the 65-year-old said she'd be game to reprise her beloved character on the big screen.""It's in the talking stage — I would definitely be in. We'll see what happens,"" Drescher teased, adding that a Broadway musical based on the sitcom is currently in development.""['The Nanny'] is the gift that keeps on giving,"" she beamed, crediting the show's new life on HBO Max, which has led to a new generation of ""Nanny"" fans. ""For that, I'm very grateful.""Alexandra is a Senior Media and Entertainment Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

41,797a7605-9ac1-35e4-9da2-de73fa1f855d,PSX,2022-10-24,7 Oil Stock Predictions for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-oil-stock-predictions-2023-172328577.html,1666286608,STORY,"['KMI', 'MUSA', 'ENB', 'XOM', 'KOS', 'PSX']","[When considering oil stock predictions for 2023, the arguably logical choice is that valuations for the sector will rise. Fundamentally, skyrocketing inflation this year imposed substantial burdens on consumers. Moreover, with oil-producing nations deciding to cut production, you have a case of more money chasing after fewer goods. That’s the classic definition of inflation.At the same time, oil stock predictions for 2023 represent a fluid variable. For instance, the Federal Reserve recently reaffirmed its commitment to tackling soaring prices. What’s more, the central bank augmented words with action. Therefore, it’s not impossible for hydrocarbon energy prices to decline. That’s especially true if the Fed acts too aggressively with interest rate hikes, thereby leading to a recession.Still, Russia imposes a wildcard on oil stock predictions for 2023. With the country cutting off critical energy outflows to Europe, it controls a vital component of supply. At the same time, the Fed may influence demand.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith no one offering the authoritative answer, I will provide two scenarios regarding the below oil stock predictions for 2023: one assumes a bullish catalyst for hydrocarbons while the other assumes bearish dynamics. That way, you can decide what you want to do.XOMExxon Mobil$104.14SHELShell$52.01KMIKinder Morgan$17.25ENBEnbridge$37.28PSXPhillips 66$98.71MUSAMurphy USA$278.05KOSKosmos Energy$6.30Exxon Mobil (XOM)XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some TimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comOne of the major powers in the hydrocarbon space, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) presently features a market capitalization of $432.5 billion. On a year-to-date basis, XOM gained over 63%, representing one of the few places for growth this year. It features a forward yield of 3.4% with a payout ratio of 32.3%.In terms of oil stock predictions for 2023, I am biased toward the upside. Currently, Gurufocus labels XOM as “fairly valued.” Financially, Exxon features a well-balanced business, enjoying stability in the balance sheet while also expanding its business based on free cash flows. Further, it’s a quality business, anchored by an above-sector-average return on equity of 23%.Story continuesBased on present growth and profitability projections, a move of 10% higher isn’t out of the question in 2023. Still, investors must be cognizant of the other side of the equation.Against a longer-term trajectory, revenue growth is somewhat disappointing. And its recent net income surge may not be sustainable. Therefore, a return to pre-pandemic levels of around $70 may be possible.Shell (SHEL)logo on a gas station in Iceland.Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comAn international hydrocarbon powerhouse, Shell (NYSE:SHEL) enjoys a market cap of $185.6 billion. Since the start of the year, SHEL gained 16%. While a strong figure compared to broader equity indices, it conspicuously lags names like Exxon Mobil. Presently, Shell offers a forward yield of 3.8% with a payout ratio of 19.5%.Still, Shell brings plenty of positives to the table. Per Gurufocus, SHEL rates as a “modestly undervalued” investment. Core to its strength is its profitability metrics. For instance, Shell features above-sector-average metrics for operating and net margins. Additionally, it features a return on equity of 21.6%, reflecting a quality business.Based on its current earnings trajectory, SHEL could easily gain 10% from here. Again, it underperforms other big energy peers so 2023 could be Shell’s year.Nevertheless, on the negative side of oil stock predictions, Shell’s longer-term revenue trajectory isn’t impressive. Should a global recession hit, SHEL could slip to technical support lying at $40.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comA midstream specialist, Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) focuses on the infrastructural side of the hydrocarbon industry. This segment includes services such as storage and transportation of critical commodities. Presently, Kinder Morgan features a market cap of $39.1 billion. KMI commands an attractive forward yield of 6.4% though its payout ratio of 90.8% is high.On paper, Kinder Morgan features a “modestly undervalued” business. Its main highlights focus on the profitability section of the income statement. Gross, operating and net margins ping conspicuously above sector averages. As well, the company enjoys a 10-year track record of consecutive profitability. Such an established business profile may command a premium during these uncertain times.KMI is up 5% YTD. For oil stock predictions, KMI might be a bit of a slow gainer. However, it can gradually move toward $18, its price point just before the pandemic.On the other hand, an aggressive Fed may spark a recession, which would reduce hydrocarbon demand. In that case, a decline to $16 where technical support lies will be a logical downside target.Enbridge (ENB)Enbridge (ENB) sign on the head Enbridge office in Toronto, Canada.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comA multinational pipeline company, Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) enjoys an attractive case for midstream companies to buy. Per its corporate profile, Enbridge’s pipeline system is the longest in North America. Currently, the company offers a forward yield of 7.1%, an attractive figure for inflation-hit consumers. However, with a payout ratio of 115%, sustainability questions arise regarding this passive income source.Nevertheless, because of Enbridge’s relevancies, ENB might get a pass from arguably most investors. Per Gurufocus, Enbridge is a “fairly valued” business. If I’m being honest, nothing truly spectacular pops out, though the company enjoys above-sector-average operating and net margins. Importantly, though, Enbridge has a long history of consecutive years of profitability, which provides immense credibility.Despite relevancies, ENB is down 5% YTD. Moving forward, I think a return to $47 presents a reasonable target for oil stock predictions for 2023.On the other side of the fence, midstream players remain tethered to economic stability. If the Fed or some other geopolitical circumstance goes awry, look for ENB to drop to the psychologically important level of $30.Phillips 66 (PSX)Phillips 66 gas station in the daytimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWhile upstream players (exploration and production) present excitement and midstream firms (storage and transportation) generate economic headlines, the downstream component (refining and marketing) really hits your wallet. When you go fill up at the pump, you’re helping downstream specialists like Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX).Right now, Phillips 66 features a market cap of $47 billion. It also features a forward yield of 3.9% and a payout ratio of 32.6%. Financially, Gurufocus labels PSX “fairly valued.” As with Enbridge above, Phillips 66 is geared more toward profitability metrics. For instance, the company enjoys a return on equity of nearly 27%, ranking higher than almost 79% of the industry.PSX gained a stout 29% for the year. In terms of oil stock predictions for 2023, it can probably hit the $120 mark if supply-demand dynamics favor hydrocarbon players.If not, the situation could get ugly, depending on the impact to the consumer economy. I would say watch technical support at $70 very closely during a bearish wave.Murphy USA (MUSA)Murphy USA gas station and convenience store located on an out parcel of a Walmart SupercenterSource: Lawrence Glass / Shutterstock.comAnother downstream specialist, Murphy USA (NYSE:MUSA) represents a vital cog for the consumer economy, particularly those deeply impacted by soaring inflation. Fundamentally, Murphy USA enjoys a viable footprint because it positions its gasoline stations near discount-centric big-box retailers. Therefore, its (relatively) lower prices attract eyeballs.Currently, the company commands a market cap of $6.45 billion. Since the start of the year, MUSA gained nearly 40%. Given the downstream player’s paltry forward yield of 0.46% — backed by a payout ratio of 7.9% — investors aren’t really looking to MUSA for its passive income.Financially, Gurufocus labels shares “modestly overvalued.” On paper, it’s difficult to come away with any other assessment. For instance, the company features above-sector-average metrics for growth but lower-than-average metrics for profitability. Nevertheless, it is a high-quality business, featuring a return on equity of 69.5%.In terms of oil price predictions, I can see MUSA hitting record highs of $320 a pop should inflation soar based on reduced supplies. On the flipside, if deflationary forces take over, I would look very closely at the $220 level as the first major support zone.Kosmos Energy (KOS)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comOne of the more speculative but downright exciting companies in the hydrocarbon space, Kosmos Energy (NYSE:KOS) plies its trade in the upstream segment. Specifically, it focuses on deepwater exploration projects in proven offshore basins in offshore Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.Currently, Kosmos commands a market cap of $2.85 billion, gaining 66.6% YTD. What makes the company riskier than others is that it’s a purely growth-driven enterprise. The company features no dividends, so what you get in the market is what you’ll leave with.Financially, Gurufocus labels KOS as “fairly valued.” Though it generally features middle-of the-road statistics, Kosmos unsurprisingly is geared toward growth. For instance, its three-year revenue expansion rate stands well above the industry median. It’s also a high-quality business, with a return on equity of 40.6%.Regarding oil stock predictions, reduced hydrocarbon supplies (which should correspond with higher prices) will likely spark significant upside for KOS, perhaps above $8. However, a recession could drop shares to $3.50 where strong technical support lies.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.99bUS$4.36bUS$4.58bUS$4.95bUS$5.22bUS$5.45bUS$5.65bUS$5.83bUS$5.99bUS$6.15bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x10Analyst x4Analyst x3Est @ 5.45%Est @ 4.41%Est @ 3.68%Est @ 3.17%Est @ 2.81%Est @ 2.56% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.0% US$3.8kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.9kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$37bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.0%– 2.0%) = US$155bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$155b÷ ( 1 + 6.0%)10= US$86bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$123b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$243, the company appears quite good value at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at General Dynamics as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.867. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

That was up from 830,000 tonnes in August and 780,000 tonnes a year ago.Exports of aviation fuel, including refuelling at Chinese airports for airlines plying international routes, jumped by 38.6% from a year earlier to 1.23 million tonnes last month. This is the highest monthly volume since April 2020, the data showed.Data from air traffic tracking specialist Variflight showed total passenger flight turnover last month, including departures and landings, amounted to 369,536 trips, which was 36.5% lower than August and 42% less than September of 2021.September gasoline exports were 660,000 tonnes, down 28.3% from a year earlier and also down 41% from August, the data showed.China had maintained broad curbs on fuel exports this year, resulting in total fuel exports in the first nine months of 2022 falling 28% from a year earlier.But in an about-turn in fuel trade policy, Beijing in late September released an additional large batch of 15 million tonnes of export quotas, including 13.25 million tonnes for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, with the remainder for marine fuel.The move was seen helping to bolster exports in the coming months and likely through March of 2023.Data also showed liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports rebounded to 5.9 million tonnes ahead of the winter heating season, the highest monthly volume since January, though that was 11.6% below the year-ago level.Year-to-date shipments were also down 20% from the same period in 2021 at 46.51 million tonnes, with whole-year imports on track to post the first major decline since China began importing the super-chilled fuel in 2006, as COVID restrictions and high global prices blunted Chinese purchases.Story continuesPipeline gas imports last month, on the other hand, rose 9.8% from a year earlier to 4.25 million tonnes, the data showed. Year-to-date imports rose 10.5% from a year earlier to 34.66 million tonnes.Despite the fall in total LNG imports, China, which is set to fall behind Japan this year to become the world's second largest LNG importer, shipped in 819,345 tonnes of the fuel from Russia last month, up 33% from a year ago, customs data showed.The September volume is the highest since at least February of 2019, according to Reuters' record of customs figures.Table below shows trade details, volumes in million tonnes.Exports Sept y/y % change Jan-Sept y/y % changeGasoline 0.66 -28 8.22 -30.3Diesel 1.73 123 4.98 -68Jet fuel 1.23 39 6.77 9.3Imports Sept y/y % change Jan-Sept y/y % changeLNG 5.9 -11.6 46.5 -20Piped gas 4.25 9.8 34.66 10.5(Reporting by Dominique Patton and Chen Aizhu; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)]"

TTF prices for the first quarter of next year still trade at 144.64 EUR/MWh, while prices for the whole 2023 calendar year trade at 142.43 EUR/MWh. That reflects the fact that, if the war in Ukraine continues, Europe is likely to face a full year without Russian gas next year, forcing it to make bigger, and more regular, purchases on the spot market throughout 2023.Moreover, ""LNG cargo owners know that winter is just around the corner,"" argued Alexander Stahel of Swiss-based consultancy Burggraben. As such, he noted, they are parking LNG tankers offshore waiting for colder temperatures to pump up demand and free up storage capacity, rather than redirect them to other markets. This is tightening the global market considerably, Stahel said.Story continuesRelated ArticlesEuropean Gas Prices Slump Again on Warm Weather, Full StorageCotton exporter Benin developing home-grown textile industryOil prices drop as China demand data disappoints]"

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude lost $84.58 a barrel, losing 47 cents, 0.6%. Both benchmarks had fallen by $2 a barrel earlier in the session.Although higher than in August, China's September crude imports of 9.79 million barrels per day were 2% below a year earlier, customs data showed on Monday, as independent refiners curbed throughput amid thin margins and lacklustre demand.""The recent recovery in oil imports faltered in September,"" ANZ analysts said in a note, adding that independent refiners failed to utilise increased quotas as ongoing COVID-related lockdowns weighed on demand.Uncertainty over China's zero-COVID policy and property crisis are undermining the effectiveness of pro-growth measures, ING analysts said in a note, even though third-quarter gross domestic product growth beat expectations.Ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar, which was up again for part of the trading session following another suspected foreign exchange intervention by Japan, also posed problems for oil prices. A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for non-U.S. buyers.""Further dollar strength would weigh on WTI values with a test of our expected downside at the 79.50 mark likely by week’s end,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates.Oil prices regained some ground after data that showed U.S. business activity contracted for a fourth straight month in October, with manufacturers and services firms in a monthly survey of purchasing managers both reporting weaker client demand.Story continuesPOSITIVE SIGNALS&amp;P Global said its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to 47.3 this month from a final reading of 49.5 in September.That weakening could indicate that the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate increases to fight inflation have been working and may persuade it to slow its rate hike policies, a positive signal for fuel demand, said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures group.""The miss on the PMI number is a sign that the economy may be slowing a bit, which turns out to be bullish,"" Flynn said.Brent rose last week despite U.S. President Joe Biden announcing the sale of a remaining 15 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, part of a record 180 million-barrel release that began in May.Biden added that his aim would be to replenish stocks when U.S. crude is around $70 a barrel.But Goldman Sachs said the stocks release was unlikely to have a large impact on prices.""Such a release is likely to have only a modest influence (&lt;$5/bbl) on oil prices"", the bank said in a note.(Adttional reporting by Noah Browning and Florence Tan; Editing by Marguerita Choy, David Holmes and Cynthia Osterman)]"

During that decade, annual revenue dwindled from $100 billion to $54 billion in 2020.It’s understandable that investors have become skeptical of a few good quarters of improving growth. Nevertheless, it’s worth noting that trailing 12-month revenue has increased during the last four consecutive quarters.It’s also worth noting that the strong US dollar impacted revenues significantly during the third quarter. In constant currency terms, hybrid cloud revenue was up 20%.NYSE: IBM Revenue, Earnings, and Cash Flow 21st October 2022Cash is KingWhile IBM’s revenues have fallen 40% over the last decade, the cash flow margin has for the most part remained between 10 and 15%. The company still generates large amounts of free cash, most of which is paid out as a dividend, with the yield now at 5.4%. IBM has managed to maintain or increase its dividend every quarter since 2012.During most of the last decade, investors have favored growth rather than profits, cash flow and dividends, meaning IBM was one of the worst-performing large-cap tech stocks in the market. That’s all changed now, which explains why IBM is one of the few stocks that are up over the last 12 months.Story continuesIs the Dividend Sustainable?If you look at IBM’s dividend coverage  based on EPS, you may be alarmed to see it paying out 430% of earnings as a dividend. This number is affected by non-cash items, but the coverage based on free cash flow tells a different story.The company has generated around $5.5 bln of free cash flow this year but said it still expects to generate around $10 bln for the full year. This isn’t unusual as IBM generates a lot of its cash flow in the first and fourth quarters of the year.The total dividend payment for the full year will be about $5.9 bln, so there should be adequate coverage.Some investors would prefer to see the cash flow used for share buybacks - but as far as the current strategy goes, the company’s cash flows seem to cover the dividend adequately.What this Means for InvestorsIn the current environment of uncertainty, profits and cash flows have become key attributes for a company - which makes IBM a better prospect than it’s been for a very long time. In addition, there seems to be potential for long-term growth, but we would like to see more confirmation that this is sustainable.If you would like to learn more about the company and assess the current valuation take a look at our  full analysis of IBM . Note: IBM’s recent earnings have been affected by non-cash items, so the price-to-earnings ratio isn’t a fair reflection, but you can use the price-to-sales ratio to compare the company to its peers and industry.Have feedback on this article?

To help schools worldwide proactively prepare for and respond to cyberattacks, IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the first eight recipients of the 2022 IBM Education Security Preparedness Grants, totaling $5 million in in-kind services. Each grant will sponsor IBM Service Corps volunteers to address the selected school districts' cybersecurity resiliency.IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM)As the FBI, DHS CISA, and MS-ISCA anticipate an increase in cyberattacks against schools during the 2022/2023 academic year, schools are bracing for potential attacks and the significant costs that follow. With cybercriminals continuing to view schools as compelling targets, IBM's 2022 Cost of a Data Breach Report* revealed that the cost of a data breach averages $3.86 million for education institutions. While the report found that 49% of data breaches the industry experienced were caused by a malicious attack, nearly 30% occurred due to human error, emphasizing the need for proper cybersecurity training and education in schools.The IBM Education Security Preparedness Grants program, now in its second year, received more than 120 applications from schools across the U.S. and will award six school districts with grants. This year the program is also expanding overseas with grant recipients in Ireland and UAE being announced today, and with recipients in Costa Rica and Brazil to be announced at a later date.The 2022 IBM Education Security Preparedness Grant recipients are:City of Dublin Educational Training Board – IrelandMohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence – UAECupertino Union School District – Sunnyvale, CARossville Cons. School District – Rossville, INEast China School District – East China, MINewburgh Enlarged City School District – Newburgh, NYGoffstown School District – Goffstown, NHPrince William County Public Schools – Manassas, VAStory continues""Ransomware operators are increasingly setting their sights on schools, putting more pressure on these institutions to prioritize their cybersecurity. Cyberattacks on schools do not only impact the schools themselves, as the aftermath cascades down to students and their families, creating a very palpable effect on their communities,"" said Charles Henderson, Global Managing Partner, and Head of IBM Security X-Force. ""We're proud to be able to support schools through this initiative, now in its second year, by helping to address critical gaps in security resources and planning and preparedness.""The grant applications that IBM received shed light on the schools' levels of cybersecurity awareness, preparedness, and training, confirming that there is always a growing need for improved security education and skills across industries and around the world.Key findings from applications included:Targets of Cyberattacks – One in four applicants has experienced a cybersecurity breach or ransomware attack, indicating that cybercriminals are taking advantage of the sector's security constraints.Absence of Readiness – The majority of school districts say they do not have a cybersecurity plan in place and have not received any cybersecurity training, increasing the security risk posed by human error.Lack of Resources – Just 20% of districts have personnel dedicated to cybersecurity.Now in its second year, this program has already benefited schools across the country. Barrett Puschus, Director of Information Technology at Brevard Public Schools, and one of the six recipients of the 2021 Education Security Preparedness grant, said ""Before this grant, we were completely lacking in confidence in our cybersecurity. The IBM team came in and showed us how to create a cybersecurity strategy and plan for emergencies based on our needs. We feel optimistic about our cybersecurity posture today thanks to IBM's help. The IBM team was populated with top-tier experts and our team benefited greatly from all their knowledge and experience. If you have data and systems worth protecting, as all schools do, this program is extremely worthwhile.""IBM Service Corps volunteers are expected to be working with the schools to help them proactively prepare for and respond to cyber threats. Depending on each school's needs, the engagements may include the creation of incident response plans, ransomware playbooks, updating technology, cybersecurity training for school communities, and more.""We're excited to be launching this program for the second year in a row as part of IBM's Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives to help schools strengthen their security postures in response to the growing threats in the education space,"" said Patrice Key-Rhone, Global Director of Employee Giving &amp; Volunteerism at IBM. ""At IBM we're committed to supporting schools around the globe via our education and volunteer programs in order to help create equitable impact.""About IBM SecurityIBM Security offers one of the most advanced and integrated portfolios of enterprise security products and services.

Consequently, the segment is likely to contribute to overall revenues when it reports third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 25.PulteGroup has exhibited a solid performance so far this year, with the stock outperforming the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry. The company has been riding high on its focus on entry-level buyers and liquidity protection, prudent management of cash flows, and land investment strategy. However, accelerating mortgage rates and continuous supply-chain issues pose a concern.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q3 performance is expected to be.PulteGroup, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePulteGroup, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePulteGroup, Inc. price-eps-surprise | PulteGroup, Inc. QuoteA Look at Q3 Segmental PerformancePulteGroup’s Homebuilding segment is expected to have registered growth, courtesy of a higher average selling price or ASP.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues of $4.02 billion suggests an increase of 18.7% on a year-over-year basis.PulteGroup expects ASP within $540,000-$550,000, indicating an increase from $474,000 registered a year ago. It expects home deliveries within 7,000-7,400, indicating growth (considering the mid-point of the guided range) from 7,007 homes delivered a year ago.The consensus mark for ASP is $545,000, which points to a 15% year-over-year improvement. For the quarter to be reported, the consensus mark for the number of homes closed is 7,127, which points to a 1.7% year-over-year increase.A prudent land investment strategy and focus on entry-level buyers are expected to have benefited PulteGroup in the third quarter. However, rising mortgage rates might have impacted the demand for homes in the quarter, which is expected to have reflected in the quarterly sales as well as orders for homes.Also, the company has been witnessing supply-chain challenges that are resulting in construction-related delays. The labor market tightened with the limited availability of labor, arresting the rapid growth in housing production. These headwinds might have impacted the upcoming results to some extent.Nonetheless, improved operating leverage and higher pricing are expected to have mitigated the risks. As such, given these cost price dynamics, PHM expects homebuilding gross margins to expand to 30% for third-quarter 2022 from 26.5% in the year-ago period.SG&amp;A expenses (as a percentage of home sales revenues) for the quarter are expected in the 9.1-9.3% range. The figure was 9.6% a year ago.Story continuesOverall Q3 Earnings &amp; Revenue ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is currently pegged at $2.75 per share, indicating 51.1% growth from the year-ago figure of $1.82.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 1.81%.AbbVie’s stock has increased 8.6% so far this year against the industry’s 1.5% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis large drugmaker’s performance has been pretty impressive, with its earnings beating estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company has a four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.46%, on average.AbbVie Inc. Price and ConsensusAbbVie Inc. Price and ConsensusAbbVie Inc. price-consensus-chart | AbbVie Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderStrong demand for immunology and aesthetic products is expected to drive AbbVie’s third-quarter 2022 sales. Sales from these two portfolios generate more than half of the company’s total revenues. In addition, the company’s new drug launches in the past few quarters are likely to have generated additional sales in the third quarter. However, currency headwinds are likely to have hurt sales.AbbVie’s immunology portfolio has been witnessing a strong surge in demand. We expect the company’s flagship drug Humira to register strong growth in the United States, which is more than likely to offset the downward trend in the drug’s international sales due to generic erosion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Humira is pegged at $5.55 billion, including $615 million from international markets and the rest from the U.S. market alone.The company’s new immunology drugs, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, registered strong growth in the past few quarters. The drugs contributed more than $3 billion in combined sales in first-half 2022. The rise in sales is likely due to label expansions of both drugs to include new patient populations in the last few quarters. These label expansions are also expected to drive sales during the third quarter. During the third quarter, Rinvoq received label expansions in European Union in ulcerative colitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis indications. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rinvoq and Skyrizi sales in the third quarter is pegged at $726 million and $1.24 billion, respectively.Story continuesAbbVie markets Imbruvica in partnership with Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ and Venclexta in partnership with Roche RHHBY. We expect JNJ-partnered Imbruvica sales to decline due to novel oral therapies hurting the drug’s sales, while Roche-partnered Venclexta sales are likely to rise as new patient starts are expected to improve. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for J&amp;J-partnered drug, Imbruvica and Roche-partnered drug, Venclexta, is pegged at $1.16 billion and $613 million, respectively. Our model estimates suggest Imbruvica sales to be $1.17 billion, while Venclexta sales are expected to stand at $636 million.In the aesthetics franchise, we expect Botox sales to rise while Juvederm sales are expected to fall due to the loss of sales in Russia and the impact of COVID in China. ABBV’s suspension of its aesthetics business operations in Russia has affected the company’s sales as Russia is a key market for fillers. In addition, sales of the neuroscience franchise also showed strong growth in recent quarters with additional sales generated by the recently approved migraine drugs Ubrelvy and Qulipta. The trend is expected to have continued for the franchise in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for aesthetics and neuroscience products stands at $1.42 and $1.82 billion, respectively. Our model predicts the aesthetics and neuroscience product revenues to be pegged at $1.46 billion and $1.79 billion, respectively.On the earnings call, investors’ focus will likely be on AbbVie’s strategies around Humira following its potential loss of exclusivity in the United States, which is expected next year. They are also likely to ask questions about the rising competition for other drugs, including Imbruvica, on the earnings call. Investors’ focus is expected to be on any update related to the guidance for 2022 due to strong currency headwinds.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for AbbVie this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here, as you will see below.

In fact, the U.S. sales force was one of the least diverse employee groups for Medtronic.""The team I worked with was fantastic,"" recalled Douglas. ""But I just wasn't seeing many others in sales who looked like me.""Today, the company's U.S. sales force looks a lot different with more women and people of color on the front lines of global health care, where they play an important role. Sales teams introduce clinicians to the company's life-saving products and therapies, and support surgeons in the operating room during procedures. In the last past few years, the company's sales organization increased its representation of women and people of color by more than two percentage points.""We know that there's still work to be done, but we're making big strides in being able to increase minority representation,"" said Carlton Weatherby, Vice President and General Manager of the Spine and Biologics business at Medtronic. ""We're being really intentional about this because the markets we serve are increasingly more diverse today than they were before. There's an expectation from our customers and our patients that they are seen and represented across the aisle or on the other side of the table.""Recruiting outside the boxAdvancing diversity in the sales team meant looking at not just gender and ethnic demographics, but also diverse backgrounds and experience. Medtronic prioritized its ongoing partnership with key sales industry groups, including the National Sales Network (NSN), a nonprofit organization empowering Black sales professionals.By establishing a significant presence at the NSN's annual conference, the company aggressively recruited talent with sales backgrounds from other industries. Dontae Fedrick is one of many employees who got their start with Medtronic through NSN.Story continues""I walked in, met with recruiters and executives, and the same day I walked out with a job offer,"" said Fedrick, who used to work in health club sales and trauma sales, but now works as a Medtronic spine sales rep. ""In my short three years with the company, I've already earned a couple of promotions, and I've been able to complete my MBA through Medtronic, which has been really great for my career.""These focused recruiting efforts and intentional actions to remove barriers led to substantial changes in the demographics of several sales teams throughout the company. For example, in the past year, the Advanced Surgical instruments team filled 30 of the 52 new associate level roles with women and 8% of the new hires were ethnically diverse.Starting with leadersFor sustainable change, the U.S. sales team needed to look beyond diversity in their associate level roles. When Amy Hurst became U.S. national sales director for the $1 billion Hernia and Wound Management business, she started changes within her own leadership team, where three of her first five hires were candidates from underrepresented groups.""By starting with diverse leadership hires, I try to demonstrate to the team that diversity and inclusion is a priority for me - whether it's reflected in gender, ethnicity, experience, education or something else,"" said Hurst. ""It's my hope that my actions embolden - and set the expectation - for others to embrace diversity and inclusion as well.""But the broader sales leadership pipeline needed examining too. An internal team identified a lack of diversity in candidates for their Emerging Sales Leader program, which helps prepare high-potential sales talent for management roles. The team worked with HR partners and leaders of employee diversity networks to raise awareness and drive a more inclusive nomination process and candidate pool for the program.The resulting changes earned an industry award from the Brandon Hall Group after ethnic diversity among participants in the Emerging Sales Leader program went from 11% in fiscal year 2019 to 44% in fiscal year 2022. That achievement included an 85% increase in ethnically diverse men and a 100% increase in diverse women. The number of women overall in the program quadrupled.Despite the program's success, there was still more work to do.Creating non-traditional management pathsThe diversity disparity in the sales teams of some businesses was larger than others.When Carlton Weatherby became Vice President and General Manager of the Spine and Biologics business in 2021, 55 out of 61 of his sales district managers were white men.""It was cultural inertia,"" said Weatherby. ""It's been harder for employees who don't fit a certain demographic to find opportunities to lead at these levels. Over the last few years, we've started building up that talent pool and creating new non-traditional paths of getting into that level of leadership.""One of those new, non-traditional paths is the District Manager Development Program (DDP), designed to identify and provide opportunity for more diverse candidates to pursue district manager roles by removing barriers such as not having specific experience in the Spine division or with Medtronic. At launch, ten candidates were enrolled in a 12- to16-month training program that will eventually lead to roles as district managers.Emily Markle is one of those candidates. After six years in her role as an Advanced Energy sales rep, she questioned if and how she could advance her career at Medtronic. Then, she was tapped to be part of the DDP.""You hear people say that you need to jump companies to get to that next level,"" said Markle, who is also a graduate of the company's Emerging Sales Leader program. ""This is a huge opportunity to step into management that I probably wouldn't have had before, not having spine sales experience.""Creating sustainable changeThe opportunity to step into a management role enticed Ursula Douglas to return to Medtronic. In 2018, she left her position as a Medtronic interventional sales rep to launch her own consulting business. But when a former colleague asked her to join the DDP, she couldn't pass up the chance to return.""This program gives me a unique opportunity to learn the inner workings of how to be a people leader,"" said Douglas, whose management role will allow her to tap into another passion - guiding the careers of other women and people of color. ""That's something I wear as a badge of honor. Mentorship is an exciting component of this opportunity for me - to hire and work with individuals to help them reach their professional and personal goals.""Equipping managers like Douglas to hire more diverse teammates is exactly the kind of long-term change Medtronic leaders are counting on.""Not only are we recruiting talent, but we are also fostering this sense of belonging within our existing talent to know that this matters to us,"" Weatherby said ""We talk a lot about leading the industry with game-changing technologies and products that improve patients' lives, but that innovation also should apply to what I consider to be our most important and valuable asset, which is our people.""Read more about our year-round actions and impact in our Global Inclusion, Diversity &amp; Equity 2021 Annual Report.Medtronic, Monday, October 24, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Medtronic on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: MedtronicWebsite: http://www.medtronic.comEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: MedtronicView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/721788/Diversifying-the-Medtronic-Sales-Force]"

The approval facilitates availability of VAXNEUVANCE for this population in all 27 European Union (EU) Member States plus Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein. VAXNEUVANCE is also indicated in the EU for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae in individuals 18 years of age and older. The use of VAXNEUVANCE in the EU should be in accordance with official recommendations.""VAXNEUVANCE was developed to maintain a strong immune response to serotypes included in currently available pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, or PCVs, while expanding coverage to disease-causing serotypes that can pose substantial risk to infants and children,"" said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. ""With this approval, we are pleased to bring an important new PCV option to a vulnerable population in Europe, including infants less than one year of age, who typically experience the highest rates of disease.""The EC’s decision follows a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), who reviewed data from eight randomized, double-blind clinical studies that enrolled approximately 8,400 individuals, including 5,400 who received VAXNEUVANCE. The studies evaluated the use of VAXNEUVANCE in various pediatric populations at risk for pneumococcal disease, including healthy infants, children and adolescents, pre-term infants and children living with HIV infection or sickle cell disease. The use of VAXNEUVANCE was also evaluated across a variety of clinical circumstances, such as interchangeable use following initiation of an infant vaccination schedule with the currently licensed 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) or in a catch-up setting for older children who are either pneumococcal vaccine-naïve or who previously received an incomplete series of another PCV.Story continuesThe data supporting the approval included findings from the pivotal PNEU-PED-EU-1 study which evaluated the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a two-dose infant series followed by a toddler dose of VAXNEUVANCE in healthy infants (n=1,184). Results showed that immune responses for VAXNEUVANCE were noninferior to PCV13 for the 13 serotypes shared between the two vaccines and superior for the two additional serotypes in VAXNEUVANCE, 22F and 33F, as assessed by serotype-specific anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide immunoglobulin G (IgG) response rates and geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) at 30 days post-toddler dose.Pneumococcal disease is an infection caused by the bacterium S. pneumoniae, or pneumococcus. While there are more than 100 different types of S. pneumoniae, called serotypes, a selected number of serotypes are responsible for the majority of pneumococcal infections. Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) can cause serious and potentially life-threatening infections such as bacteremia (infection in the bloodstream); bacteremic pneumonia (pneumonia with bacteremia); and meningitis (infection of the linings of the brain and spinal cord).In July 2021, VAXNEUVANCE received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F and 33F in adults 18 years of age and older, and in June 2022, the FDA approved an expanded indication for VAXNEUVANCE to include individuals 6 weeks through 17 years of age.About VAXNEUVANCE (Pneumococcal 15-valent Conjugate Vaccine)VAXNEUVANCE, Merck’s 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, consists of purified capsular polysaccharides from S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F and 33F individually conjugated to CRM197 carrier protein.VAXNEUVANCE is indicated in the EU for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia and acute otitis media caused by S. pneumoniae in infants, children and adolescents from 6 weeks to less than 18 years of age, and for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae in individuals 18 years of age and older.VAXNEUVANCE is indicated in the U.S. for active immunization of individuals 6 weeks of age and older for the prevention of invasive disease caused by the S. pneumoniae serotypes contained in the vaccine.Select Safety Information for VAXNEUVANCEDo not administer VAXNEUVANCE to individuals with a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of VAXNEUVANCE or to diphtheria toxoid.Some individuals with altered immunocompetence, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may have a reduced immune response to VAXNEUVANCE.Apnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some infants born prematurely. Vaccination of premature infants should be based on the infant’s medical status and the potential benefits and possible risks.The most commonly reported solicited adverse reactions in children vaccinated with a four-dose series at 2, 4, 6, and 12 through 15 months of age, provided as a range across the series, were: irritability (57.3% to 63.4%), somnolence (24.2% to 47.5%), injection-site pain (25.9% to 40.3%), fever ≥38.0°C (13.3% to 20.4%), decreased appetite (14.1% to 19.0%), injection-site induration (13.2% to 15.4%), injection-site erythema (13.7% to 21.4%) and injection-site swelling (11.3% to 13.4%).The most commonly reported solicited adverse reactions in children and adolescents 2 through 17 years of age vaccinated with a single dose were: injection-site pain (54.8%), myalgia (23.7%), injection-site swelling (20.9%), injection-site erythema (19.2%), fatigue (15.8%), headache (11.9%) and injection-site induration (6.8%).The most commonly reported solicited adverse reactions in adults 18 through 49 years of age were: injection-site pain (75.8%), fatigue (34.3%), myalgia (28.8%), headache (26.5%), injection-site swelling (21.7%), injection-site erythema (15.1%) and arthralgia (12.7%).The most commonly reported solicited adverse reactions in adults 50 years of age and older were: injection-site pain (66.8%), myalgia (26.9%), fatigue (21.5%), headache (18.9%), injection-site swelling (15.4%), injection-site erythema (10.9%) and arthralgia (7.7%).Vaccination with VAXNEUVANCE may not protect all vaccine recipients.Merck’s Commitment to Pneumococcal Disease ProtectionMerck has been at the forefront of pneumococcal disease prevention through vaccination for more than four decades and remains committed to helping to protect people of all ages from this disease. Merck’s ongoing pneumococcal vaccine development program is designed to provide tailored options to address the specific needs of different populations, including infants and children, healthy adults and at-risk subgroups. This approach recognizes that disease burden in pediatric and adult populations is often driven by different bacterial strains, or serotypes, and aims to address unmet needs by offering vaccine options that target serotypes posing the greatest global risk to each population.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Merck (NYSE:MRK). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for Merck How Fast Is Merck Growing?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Shareholders will be happy to know that Merck's EPS has grown 22% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The music to the ears of Merck shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 28% to 35% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Merck.Story continuesAre Merck Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Merck has a market capitalisation of US$242b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$184m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.08% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add Merck To Your Watchlist?For growth investors, Merck's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Merck's continuing strength. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Merck , and understanding it should be part of your investment process.Although Merck certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

85,c5d1c63b-f49f-3a54-9ecd-1e94808c8b1d,CI,2022-10-24,Is Cigna Corporation's (NYSE:CI) Latest Stock Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-corporations-nyse-ci-latest-130104509.html,1666530064,STORY,['CI'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Cigna's (NYSE:CI) stock increased significantly by 12% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Cigna's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Cigna How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cigna is:12% = US$5.5b ÷ US$46b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.12 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Cigna's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo begin with, Cigna seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 15%. This certainly adds some context to Cigna's exceptional 24% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Cigna's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 18%.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Cigna's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Cigna Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Cigna's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 0.3% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (100%) of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Besides, Cigna has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 19% over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Cigna's future ROE will rise to 16% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to rise. We presume that there could some other characteristics of the business that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Cigna's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

(NASDAQ:ANSS) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 17% in that time. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been respectable. After all, the stock has performed better than the market (55%) in that time, and is up 58%. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 42% decline over the last twelve months.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for ANSYS There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, ANSYS achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 10% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on ANSYS' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that ANSYS shareholders are down 42% for the year. Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 23%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 10%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. If you would like to research ANSYS in more detail then you might want to take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in the company.Story continuesFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

These stocks have been hammered this year, with many equities falling by 65% to 80% or more. As a result, investors are looking for cheap growth stocks to buy.At the same time, that’s a difficult game to play, given the current environment.In a bear market, cheap growth stocks can always get cheaper. Once these stocks are in a downtrend, virtually nothing can save them. Strong earnings, reasonable valuations and insider buying mean nothing to the Street during bear markets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsValuation and insider selling cannot stop these stocks during a roaring bull market, and the opposite trends cannot support stocks in down markets, either.With those caveats out of the way, let’s look at a few cheap growth stocks to buy.NFLXNetflix$321.70AMDAdvanced Micro Devices$71.94PYPLPayPal$74.23DOCNDigitalOcean$29.09CRMSalesforce$135.53Netflix (NFLX)Netflix (NFLX) app open on a phone screenSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.comA few months ago, I wrote about why Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) appears to be undervalued.If anything, Netflix went from growth stock to value stock in just six months. In that span, the shares fell more than 76%, reducing its market capitalization by hundreds of billions of dollars.It was a stunning fall for the world’s largest streaming video service. However, it created a buying opportunity.Despite the fall, Netflix has been the best-looking FAANG member from a technical perspective over the last few months. In fact, it has rallied more than 80% off its low.Admittedly, that has made Netflix stock less cheap, as the shares now trade at roughly 30 times analysts’ average 2022 earnings estimate rather than the sub-20 times valuation that it carried earlier this year.Still, the company is growing its top and bottom line, and it has a reasonable valuation. Keep an eye on Netflix when it dips.Story continuesAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comIt seems like everyone is forgetting about Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) but that’s a huge mistake. The company provides building blocks used in many types of growing technologies and is increasingly playing a larger role in critical parts of the tech sector.Whether it’s in cloud computing, gaming, graphics, machine learning, deep learning or otherwise, AMD’s chips are being widely used.Like its peers though, the company’s demand is now slipping slightly. At some point, that modest dip will be reflected in the shares after they lost two-thirds of their value. After that decline, AMD is stunningly cheap.That’s particularly true because analysts continue to expect AMD to grow going forward. And at its recent low, the shares were changing hands for less than 16 times the company’s earnings.That’s dirt cheap for a high-quality company like AMD, especially as CEO Lisa Su continues to not just boost its revenue, but nearly all of its financial metrics.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comI couldn’t help but take a stab at buying PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock in after-hours trading a few weeks ago. I rarely buy or sell stocks in after-hours trading, but the stock was plunging after PYPL reported its earnings on Nov. 3.The stock was retesting its 52-week low after the report, and I fully expected it to continue falling for a number of additional days. However, I was a buyer for the simple reason that PayPal became one of the cheap growth stocks that were too hard for me to ignore.The company’s Q3 earnings and revenue beat analysts’ mean outlooks. Interestingly though, PYPL slightly lowered its 2022 revenue guidance while boosting its earnings outlook. Since the shares were trading at about 16.5 times its 2022 EPS guidance, the stock was too tempting to pass up.I don’t know when PayPal will get back to sustainable, attractive growth and/or be loved by the Street again. However, I do know that it is too good a company to ignore at this valuation. It’s worth buying in the $70s or even $80s. That’s especially true for investors who plan to hold the shares for multiple years.Digital Ocean (DOCN)A laptop screen displays the logo for DigitalOcean (DOCN).Source: monticello / Shutterstock.comI know people will critique this pick because cloud infrastructure company DigitalOcean (NYSE:DOCN) trades at 38 times this year’s earnings estimates. However, I believe that it’s still a cheap growth stock that’s worth buying.My reasoning is based on the company’s growth outlook.It’s hard to find names that are growing rapidly but trade at low or reasonable valuations. So sometimes it’s worthwhile buying the stocks of companies that are growing rapidly, even if their valuation is a bit high.In the case of DigitalOcean, analysts, on average, expect its revenue to climb 34% this year and 29% next year. On the earnings front, the mean estimate calls for 141% growth this year and a 40% increase next year.So the shares are trading at just 27 times next year’s mean EPS estimate. (DOCN’s new fiscal year begins in just six weeks).Salesforce (CRM)lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San FranciscoSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comI had a good feeling that buyers would get a chance to scoop up Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in the $120s. My confidence about that grew when the shares were trading in the mid-$130s.But now, with CRM trading above $160, it’s possible that investors may not get a chance to buy the name in the $115 to $125 range.  Sometimes a strategy of waiting and waiting for lower prices doesn’t work out. However, Salesforce should not be ignored.While analysts’ average estimate calls for the company’s earnings to be flat this year, the mean outlook calls for double-digit-percentage revenue growth in each of the next four years. That’s not a surprise, since the company forecast revenue of $50 billion for fiscal 2026.That’s significantly ahead of analysts’ mean sales estimate for this year of $31 billion and was about $5 billion more than analysts, on average, were expecting for FY26.Even at Salesforce’s current prices, its valuation isn’t that obnoxious. In the past,  CRM was viewed as one of the most overvalued stocks in the market. That was a huge mistake, as the shares have exploded higher over the last decade.Despite CRM’s recent rally, the shares trade at “just” 33 times the company’s earnings.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in DOCN and PYPL.

91,f7669335-a046-3010-91c1-25416a36b6ab,IBM,2022-10-24,IBM (NYSE:IBM): A Cash Generating Machine Showing Tentative Signs of Growth,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-nyse-ibm-cash-generating-114518175.html,1666611918,STORY,['IBM'],"[This article first appeared on Simply Wall St News.Key Takeaways from This Analysis:IBM’s third-quarter results were slightly better than expected.Revenues have increased for four consecutive quarters despite major headwinds from the currencyThe company still has a very impressive cash flow margin and dividend yield.Q3 Earnings summary:Revenue: $14.1 bln, up 6.4% year on year and $550 mln better than consensus estimates.Non-GAAP EPS: $1.81, down from $2.52 a year ago and in line with estimates.Software revenue up 7% year-on-year.Consulting revenue up 5% year-on-year.Infrastructure revenue up 15% year-on-year.Hybrid cloud revenue up 15% year-on-year.All revenue growth numbers are significantly impacted by USD strength.Full-Year 2022 Guidance:The company now “expects constant currency revenue growth above its mid-single digit model.”Free Cash Flow: The company continues to expect about $10 billion in consolidated free cash flow.See our latest analysis for IBMIs the turnaround for real this time?Investors have been waiting for 10 years for IBM’s turnaround strategy to show up as actual revenue growth. During that decade, annual revenue dwindled from $100 billion to $54 billion in 2020.It’s understandable that investors have become skeptical of a few good quarters of improving growth. Nevertheless, it’s worth noting that trailing 12-month revenue has increased during the last four consecutive quarters.It’s also worth noting that the strong US dollar impacted revenues significantly during the third quarter. In constant currency terms, hybrid cloud revenue was up 20%.NYSE: IBM Revenue, Earnings, and Cash Flow 21st October 2022Cash is KingWhile IBM’s revenues have fallen 40% over the last decade, the cash flow margin has for the most part remained between 10 and 15%. The company still generates large amounts of free cash, most of which is paid out as a dividend, with the yield now at 5.4%. IBM has managed to maintain or increase its dividend every quarter since 2012.During most of the last decade, investors have favored growth rather than profits, cash flow and dividends, meaning IBM was one of the worst-performing large-cap tech stocks in the market. That’s all changed now, which explains why IBM is one of the few stocks that are up over the last 12 months.Story continuesIs the Dividend Sustainable?If you look at IBM’s dividend coverage  based on EPS, you may be alarmed to see it paying out 430% of earnings as a dividend. This number is affected by non-cash items, but the coverage based on free cash flow tells a different story.The company has generated around $5.5 bln of free cash flow this year but said it still expects to generate around $10 bln for the full year. This isn’t unusual as IBM generates a lot of its cash flow in the first and fourth quarters of the year.The total dividend payment for the full year will be about $5.9 bln, so there should be adequate coverage.Some investors would prefer to see the cash flow used for share buybacks - but as far as the current strategy goes, the company’s cash flows seem to cover the dividend adequately.What this Means for InvestorsIn the current environment of uncertainty, profits and cash flows have become key attributes for a company - which makes IBM a better prospect than it’s been for a very long time. In addition, there seems to be potential for long-term growth, but we would like to see more confirmation that this is sustainable.If you would like to learn more about the company and assess the current valuation take a look at our  full analysis of IBM . Note: IBM’s recent earnings have been affected by non-cash items, so the price-to-earnings ratio isn’t a fair reflection, but you can use the price-to-sales ratio to compare the company to its peers and industry.Have feedback on this article?

To help schools worldwide proactively prepare for and respond to cyberattacks, IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the first eight recipients of the 2022 IBM Education Security Preparedness Grants, totaling $5 million in in-kind services. Each grant will sponsor IBM Service Corps volunteers to address the selected school districts' cybersecurity resiliency.IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM)As the FBI, DHS CISA, and MS-ISCA anticipate an increase in cyberattacks against schools during the 2022/2023 academic year, schools are bracing for potential attacks and the significant costs that follow. With cybercriminals continuing to view schools as compelling targets, IBM's 2022 Cost of a Data Breach Report* revealed that the cost of a data breach averages $3.86 million for education institutions. While the report found that 49% of data breaches the industry experienced were caused by a malicious attack, nearly 30% occurred due to human error, emphasizing the need for proper cybersecurity training and education in schools.The IBM Education Security Preparedness Grants program, now in its second year, received more than 120 applications from schools across the U.S. and will award six school districts with grants. This year the program is also expanding overseas with grant recipients in Ireland and UAE being announced today, and with recipients in Costa Rica and Brazil to be announced at a later date.The 2022 IBM Education Security Preparedness Grant recipients are:City of Dublin Educational Training Board – IrelandMohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence – UAECupertino Union School District – Sunnyvale, CARossville Cons. School District – Rossville, INEast China School District – East China, MINewburgh Enlarged City School District – Newburgh, NYGoffstown School District – Goffstown, NHPrince William County Public Schools – Manassas, VAStory continues""Ransomware operators are increasingly setting their sights on schools, putting more pressure on these institutions to prioritize their cybersecurity. Cyberattacks on schools do not only impact the schools themselves, as the aftermath cascades down to students and their families, creating a very palpable effect on their communities,"" said Charles Henderson, Global Managing Partner, and Head of IBM Security X-Force. ""We're proud to be able to support schools through this initiative, now in its second year, by helping to address critical gaps in security resources and planning and preparedness.""The grant applications that IBM received shed light on the schools' levels of cybersecurity awareness, preparedness, and training, confirming that there is always a growing need for improved security education and skills across industries and around the world.Key findings from applications included:Targets of Cyberattacks – One in four applicants has experienced a cybersecurity breach or ransomware attack, indicating that cybercriminals are taking advantage of the sector's security constraints.Absence of Readiness – The majority of school districts say they do not have a cybersecurity plan in place and have not received any cybersecurity training, increasing the security risk posed by human error.Lack of Resources – Just 20% of districts have personnel dedicated to cybersecurity.Now in its second year, this program has already benefited schools across the country. Barrett Puschus, Director of Information Technology at Brevard Public Schools, and one of the six recipients of the 2021 Education Security Preparedness grant, said ""Before this grant, we were completely lacking in confidence in our cybersecurity. The IBM team came in and showed us how to create a cybersecurity strategy and plan for emergencies based on our needs. We feel optimistic about our cybersecurity posture today thanks to IBM's help. The IBM team was populated with top-tier experts and our team benefited greatly from all their knowledge and experience. If you have data and systems worth protecting, as all schools do, this program is extremely worthwhile.""IBM Service Corps volunteers are expected to be working with the schools to help them proactively prepare for and respond to cyber threats. Depending on each school's needs, the engagements may include the creation of incident response plans, ransomware playbooks, updating technology, cybersecurity training for school communities, and more.""We're excited to be launching this program for the second year in a row as part of IBM's Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives to help schools strengthen their security postures in response to the growing threats in the education space,"" said Patrice Key-Rhone, Global Director of Employee Giving &amp; Volunteerism at IBM. ""At IBM we're committed to supporting schools around the globe via our education and volunteer programs in order to help create equitable impact.""About IBM SecurityIBM Security offers one of the most advanced and integrated portfolios of enterprise security products and services.

94,1503e2f1-a53c-3ee1-af31-f405d3bdf729,GM,2022-10-24,7 EV Stocks to Buy During a Stock Market Crash,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-ev-stocks-buy-during-152408574.html,1666279448,STORY,"['TM', 'TSLA', 'GM', 'RIVN']","[Though electric vehicles may be the future, the market doesn’t see it that way at the moment, with several EV stocks suffering from the current market rout. Nevertheless, astute and daring investors may want to target this sector for speculative (and long-term) acquisitions. With myriad factors affecting this market segment, betting on the electrification of mobility may be wise.Fundamentally, EV stocks align with broader ideological and political principles. With climate change becoming a top priority here and internationally, merely conducting business as usual won’t fly anymore. Instead, societies must deliver substantive solutions. Moving to zero-emissions electric cars could be a step in the right direction.In addition, a market rout could be the best thing to happen to EV stocks against a longer-term framework. Presently, much speculative energy is baked into market valuations for various sectors, not just electric cars. But once the equities sector eliminates the speculation and the weak hands of the market, it could rise sustainably.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that in mind, here are seven EV stocks to buy should the equities market crash.TSLATesla$213.78LCIDLucid Motors$12.89TMToyota$134.17GMGeneral Motors$34.04RIVNRivian$31.63CHPTChargePoint$13.03VLTAVolta$1.05Tesla (TSLA)Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TXSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.comAn obvious choice among EV stocks to buy, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains the sector king because of its incredible social cachet. Tesla so utterly dominated the market that it’s almost become synonymous with the EV segment itself. Of course, this advantage can always go away without proper care and competitiveness. Nevertheless, Tesla opened a huge gap to its rivals.According to an August 2022 post on Electrek.co, Tesla still dominates the U.S. electric car market with 68% share. As well, the proof is in the hard numbers. Up until the end of December 2020, Tesla featured a retained earnings loss of $5.4 billion. However, in the following year, retained earnings turned positive to the tune of $331 million.Story continuesInterestingly, though, TSLA is down 40% on a year-to-date basis. Should a downturn occur, this is one of the EV stocks to buy on the dip.Lucid (LCID)The Lucid Motors (LCID) Plant in Arizona.Source: Around the World Photos / Shutterstock.comArguably, premium electric car manufacturer Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) offers the most credible challenge among upstart EV stocks to Tesla’s throne. Fundamentally, I appreciate how Lucid concentrates (for now) exclusively on the affluent user base. Although the underlying lithium-ion battery packs gradually declined in price annually, the events of the new normal – and of this year in particular – will likely see costs escalate.If so, you’re not going to have too many people lining up to acquire electric cars. According to data from Kelley Blue Book, the average price of a new EV stood at nearly $63,000. That was early this year. By now, I’m almost certain that prices significantly increased due to hotter-than-fire inflation. Considering that the median U.S. household income is around $70,000 today, electric cars have become inaccessible to many.Thus, Lucid’s focus on the wealthy should keep the lights on. As well, investors should admire the company’s CEO Peter Rawlinson and his willingness to roll up his sleeves. If you want to speculate on EV stocks to buy, LCID presents an attractive profile.Toyota (TM)Toyota (TM) logo on the building of a dealership during daylightSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comStepping aside from the exciting (and pure-play) EV stocks, it’s time to go boring with Toyota (NYSE:TM). As you may know, Toyota courted criticism recently for its conservative approach to the electrification of mobility. Rather than going all-in on EVs, the Japanese auto giant insists on pushing hybrid vehicles. It’s still interested in electrification but it’s basically hedging its bets.I’m not going to sit here and defend the decision because it’s too difficult to say what will happen. Nevertheless, with so many people gambling on pure-play EV stocks, betting on TM could be a smart wager. For one thing, the economics will start to impact the pure-play participants. Again, with the average price of a new electric car running at nearly $63,000, the transition is simply not available to everyone.Also, the company run a profitable business with its large mix of combustion and hybrid vehicles. While others are putting their eggs in one basket, Toyota collects a net margin of 8.42%, one of the best figures in the industry. As well, Toyota commands retained earnings of over $200 billion.General Motors (GM)General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comFor years (actually for decades), I never found American car manufacturers to be all that exciting. My personal taste in vehicles focus on Japanese, German and now British iterations. Nevertheless, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is changing my mind. Not only is the company a legacy outfit that will soon challenge Tesla’s hegemony in the realm of EV stocks, it’s not abandoning its heritage.I speak of course of the eighth generation Corvette, also known as the C8. Since its introduction, GM obliterated all competitors in the sports car segment in terms of sales volume. It continues to churn out impressive numbers despite the ravages of inflation. As well, nearly half of all C8s ordered have been acquired as convertibles, indicating robust demand within the broader demand profile.While the manual transmission may be dead, combustion engines are not. Thank you, General Motors.As for relevancies toward EV stocks, GM is electrifying the Hummer. It’s also bringing out other electric offerings to suit a variety of income brackets.Rivian Automotive (RIVN)The back of a silver Rivian (RIVN) pick-up truck.Source: Miro Vrlik Photography / Shutterstock.comIn my opinion, it’s natural for investors to have a love-hate relationship with Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN). On the pessimistic front, what appeared to be an intriguing idea among EV stocks turned into a nightmare. For instance, the company launched its initial public offering in November of last year. Since then, it’s been almost nothing but red ink.According to data from Google Finance, since its first public close, RIVN stock hemorrhaged 75% of market value. One of the main problems is competition. With everyone churning out EVs, it’s difficult to remain relevant.That said, since apparently hitting a bottom on May 11 of this year, RIVN shares gained almost 52%. Unlike other upstarts, Rivian features actual revenue. In the second quarter of 2022, it posted sales of $364 million, up an infinite magnitude compared to the zero-sales result of Q2 2021.Further, in the copycat world of EVs, Rivian’s electric pickup truck and SUV look downright gorgeous. I’ve seen them in person and they’re stunning. Maybe, that could be the “it” factor that distinguishes RIVN from other EV stocks.ChargePoint (CHPT)CHPT a chargepoint charging stationSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comWhile we could spend our time focusing exclusively on primary EV stocks – that is, on the automakers themselves – it pays to consider the infrastructural market ideas. After all, companies like ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) benefit from the ticket sales concept.Infrastructural EV stocks to buy align with the principle of selling tickets to the big game. You don’t know which team might win the contest. All you care about is getting your hind ends in the seats. Therefore, you’ll do anything, even pit rival fans against each other, to deliver on your objective. In other words, the robust competition in the EV sector presents a downwind opportunity for CHPT stock.As well, data cited by the Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy notes that 63% of all occupied housing units have a garage or carport. By logical deduction, 37% of housing units don’t have a garage or carport. Therefore, infrastructure must be built out, which could support CHPT. However, no guarantees exist so be aware of the risks.Volta (VLTA)A photograph of a Volta charging station.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comIn recent publications for InvestorPlace, I’ve mentioned Volta (NYSE:VLTA) as one of the more intriguing EV stocks to buy for speculators. The emphasis is on speculation. For one thing, VLTA closed the Oct. 19 session priced at $1.03. Under arguably most investors’ definition, VLTA represents a penny stock.It’s also a good time to bring up the performance of Volta this year in the market. Shares hemorrhaged nearly 85% of market value. Needless to say, that’s an enormous loss so prospective participants must pay close attention and conduct their due diligence.However, Volta represents a distinct take on the EV charging segment. Utilizing an advertisement-driven business model for its charging posts, Volta seeks to enhance EV integration while also improving foot traffic and sales volume for underlying advertisers.It’s a bold, innovative approach, one that might be a high-risk, high-reward winner among EV stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Forbes defines contrarian investing as “holding a viewpoint on the market that is out of favor, and then doing the necessary research to determine if there’s an investment opportunity.” Of course, contrarian investing can also involve buying stocks that the market has largely given up on. In this column, I will explore seven contrarian stocks to buy.Going against the market’s prevailing wisdom is difficult both because doing so tends to raise self-doubt and to be risky. It often causes self-doubt because it’s natural to ask: “How can I be right and so many great experts and huge banks be wrong?” It tends to be risky because stocks are shunned by the market for reasons, and the market’s logic could conceivably turn out to be right. If the latter scenario materializes, contrarians probably lose a great deal of their money.If, on the other hand, the market is wrong, contrarians can make huge profits. There are many examples that come to mind. Among them are Michael Burry’s bets against the housing sector, banks and collateralized bonds in 2007, Warren Buffett’s purchase of bank stocks in 2008, and those who bought oil stocks in the spring of 2020.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are seven contrarian stocks to buy that could generate gigantic profits over the longer term.SymbolCompanyPriceARVLArrival$0.74SOLOElectrameccanica Vehicles$1.09PLUGPlug Power$16.96SRNESorrento$1.58TSLATesla$214.91LKNCYLuckin Coffee$15.55TGTTarget$157.24Arrival (ARVL)An electric vehicle charger is seen next to a row of blue electric buses.Source: BigPixel Photo / Shutterstock.comArrival (NASDAQ:ARVL) stock has plunged a whopping 90.5% this year. Apparently, the Street has lost faith in the company because it now expects to deliver only 20 EVs this year, versus its previous target of 400-600. And most are apparently betting that the company will go bankrupt before it’s able to realize revenue on a significant percentage of the 10,000 electric delivery vans that UPS (NYSE:UPS) has ordered from it.Story continuesBut ARVL continues to show signs of progress and indications that it remains on the road to ultimate success. Importantly, just a few weeks ago, Arrival President Avinash Rugoobur told Automotive News Europe that the company had plans to start testing its delivery vans in conjunction with UPS “shortly.” The statement suggests that UPS remains very much interested in buying the vans from Arrival.Further, Rugoobur reported that the company has a few ways to raise the capital it needs to expand production without diluting ARVL stock. Among these methods are obtaining loans for the U.S. government, “strategic partnerships, and licensing its intellectual property,” he explained. And Arrival’s CEO, Denis Sverdlov told the publication that: “Demand is many times more than supply,” indicating that the automaker can easily sell the EVs that it produces.Electrameccanica Vehicles (SOLO)The Solo vehicle from Electra Meccanica Vehicles (SOLO) drives through VancouverSource: Luis War / Shutterstock.comElectrameccanica Vehicles (NASDAQ:SOLO) is another EV maker that many on the Street appear to be convinced will fail. SOLO stock has sunk 52% in 2022 and 68% over the last 12 months, while the shares are nearly 75% below their 52-week high of $4.10.But a deal that Electrameccanica has made with a major Pizza Hut franchisee shows that the automaker’s potential remains very high. Under the agreement, American West Restaurant Group, which is, according to QSR: “The largest Pizza Hut franchisee in California,” is utilizing the automaker’s SOLO Cargo EV for pizza delivery.Although America West is only utilizing 14 of the single-seat SOLO Cargo EVs at this point, the company, which “operates approximately 300 Pizza Hut quick service restaurants” just in the Los Angeles area, can easily order many more of the EVs down the road. And America West’s utilization of the SOLO Cargo EVs indicates that their combination of an affordable purchase price, small size, low operational costs, and environmental friendliness make them an excellent fit for food delivery.Consequently, I think there’s a good chance that Electrameccanica can deliver thousands of SOLO Cargo EVs in the not-too-distant future.Plug Power (PLUG)Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockTwo deals recently announced by Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) indicate that the demand for its products is rapidly growing. PLUG sells hydrogen-fueled material-handling products such as forklifts, as well as tools called electrolyzers that are used to make hydrogen fuel. Finally, the company is in the process of becoming a major supplier of “green hydrogen.” The latter term refers to hydrogen that’s produced from electricity generated by clean, renewable fuels.On Oct. 19, PLUG announced that it would partner with Olin (NYSE:OLN) to launch a new hydrogen plant that is slated to generate 15 tons per day of hydrogen. Plug is reportedly experiencing delays in the development of a plant in New York and scrapped plans to develop two other hydrogen plants. Still, the company still intends to fulfill its original goal of producing 200 tons of hydrogen per day at the end of next year and is seeking to generate 500 tons per day of green hydrogen “by 2025.”PLUG’s partnership with Olin and its lofty expansion plans indicates that the demand for hydrogen remains quite high. Additionally, Plug has reported that the margins it obtains from selling the fuel will climb meaningfully as it brings more plants online.Also worth noting is that, on Oct. 19, the company announced that it would provide “material handling products to “nine additional sites and nearly 400 lift trucks” owned by FreezPak Logistics. Described by Plug as “a leading third party food logistics company,” FreezPak is an existing Plug Power customer. The deal both helps provide validation of the benefits of Plug’s material-handling products and suggests that the demand for them continues to grow.PLUG stock has tumbled 40% in 2022 and 50% over the last 12 months.Sorrento (SRNE)A doctor points at an abstract representation of various aspects of oncology. SHPH stockSource: Oleg Ivanov IL / Shutterstock.comSorrento (NASDAQ:SRNE), a drug maker, has posted a string of good news in recent weeks. On Aug. 31, the company’s subsidiary, Scilex, announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had bestowed fast-track status on SP-103, its non-opioid treatment for lower back pain. The FDA’s decision shows that it believes that SP-103 is a very promising drug that can fulfill an important role.Moreover, on Sept. 15, SRNE reported that rheumatoid arthritis patients who were administered a drug using its Sofusa Lymphatic Drug Delivery System were in better condition than those who were administered the treatment using a different delivery method.Finally, on Aug. 23, the company stated that a Phase 3 trial of its abivertinib drug had generated a promising “overall response rate of 56.5%” among non-small cell lung cancer patients.After plunging 68% in 2022 and 77% over the last year, SRNE stock has a fairly low market capitalization of $715 million.Tesla (TSLA)Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TXSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.comNot that long ago, it would have been unthinkable to label Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), long one of the market’s favorite tech darlings, as a contrarian stock.But after TSLA stock sank 37% this year and fell about 50% below its all-time high, I think it’s fair to give that label to the EV maker.However, Tesla continues to report strong results and dominate the rapidly growing U.S. EV sector. On Oct. 20, the company reported third-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $1.05, versus analysts’ average outlook of $1.01. Additionally, its revenue jumped 56% YOY to $21.45 billion, although its top line was $510 million below the mean outlook.The company reported that its “revenue, operating profit and free cash flow” had all reached record levels last quarter, while in the year that ended in September, its free cash flow had come in at a very impressive $8.9 billion.Also noteworthy is that, in the first half of this year, Tesla’s sales constituted two-thirds of America’s total EV sales, showing that Elon Musk’s company remains by far the leading EV maker in its home market.Luckin Coffee (LKNCY)close up luckin coffee's logo coffee brand in Shanghai, June 2019.Source: NewsToday / Shutterstock.comOnce left for dead by most on the Street following its 2020 accounting scandal, Luckin Coffee (OTCMKTS:LKNCY) has proven to everyone that it’s alive and kicking. Still, with the shares still well over 50% below their all-time high, it appears that most big investors remain fairly bearish on the name.As I noted in a previous column: “The company owns and operates hundreds of coffee shops and a coffee delivery business in China.”However, Luckin actually reported rather strong second-quarter results in August. Specifically, its sales soared 72% year-over-year to $493 million, while it generated EPS of 16 cents.Additionally, showing confidence in its own outlook, the coffee shop owner added a net total of 615 new stores in Q2.And in another sign of confidence in itself, Luckin last August redeemed $110 million of its bonds that were not due until 2027.Finally, as China terminates its strict, anti-coronavirus policies in the coming months, Luckin’s financial results and LKNCY stock are likely to get another, big boost.Target (TGT)Image of the Target logo on a storefront.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comTarget (NYSE:TGT) is another fallen star, as the shares have tumbled 38% over the last six months, and they now trade at a relatively low forward price-earnings ratio of 12.8.The retailer’s second-quarter results were negatively impacted by excess inventories and supply-chain woes. But those issues should dissipate starting this quarter. Moreover, despite the company’s problems, its comparable sales climbed 2.5% YOY in Q2.Meanwhile, in line with my theory that U.S. consumers are likely to shift back to spending more money on goods relatively soon, Wells Fargo expects Target’s financial results to rebound next year, with a significant increase in its profitability.And Jeffries on Oct. 18 upgraded TGT stock to “buy” from “hold.” The firm thinks that the company has made progress in reducing its inventory, and it expects the company’s margins to climb in 2023. Among Target’s positive catalysts next year will be: “Lower freight costs and improved e-commerce efficiency,” along with its partnerships with Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA).On the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of ARVL, SOLO, and LKNCY.  The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.13bUS$2.47bUS$2.71bUS$3.10bUS$3.39bUS$3.62bUS$3.82bUS$3.99bUS$4.14bUS$4.27bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.15%Est @ 7%Est @ 5.5%Est @ 4.44%Est @ 3.7%Est @ 3.19% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$2.0kUS$2.2kUS$2.3kUS$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$24bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.0%) = US$104bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$104b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$58bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$81b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$218, the company appears about fair value at a 5.0% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intuitive Surgical as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.891. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Intuitive Surgical, we've put together three relevant elements you should further examine:Financial Health: Does ISRG have a healthy balance sheet?

The U.S Centers for Disease Control recently lifted Covid 19 related restrictions, which could be a major catalyst in growing bookings in the latter half of the year. Indeed, cruise stocks remain among the highest-leverage plays investors looking to benefit from near-term catalysts can jump on.The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) recently released a statement that over 75% of its member ships have resumed service, with almost all expected back on the seas by late summer. Moreover, it projects passenger metrics to grow past pre-pandemic levels by the conclusion of next year.With cautious optimism, let’s look at three of the largest (and best) cruise stocks to invest in at this time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCCLCarnival$8.04RCLRoyal Caribbean Cruises$47.65NCLHNorwegian Cruise Line$14.31Carnival (CCL)Carnival (CCL) cruise ship on water in front of beach with chairsSource: FlickrCarnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) is the world’s largest cruise operator, and among the best cruise stocks to own right now. With 91 ships across its cruise line banners, Carnival has an overall capacity of over 243,000 berths. That’s massive.The company’s ships have been docked at port for the better of the past couple of years. Accordingly, CCL stock has struggled under the weight of its massive debt load. However, in recent quarters, revenues have started to flow in at an incredible pace, and are likely to continue growing at a robust clip.Revenues in the company’s second and third quarters have grown by 4,702% and 688.5%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, Carnival’s CFO David Bernstein talked about the cruiseliner’s potential to sail past its 2019 EBITDA levels next year with the removal of coronavirus restrictions. Bookings for the full year are likely to be above historical averages, and at considerably higher prices compared to its 2019 results.Story continuesAlso, CCL generated more than $300 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, expecting to narrow down net losses in the upcoming quarters. These forecasts are highly encouraging, considering the seasonality of its business. Despite these positives, CCL stock is trading as if it was going bankrupt.Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL)Serenade of the Seas cruiseSource: NAN728 / Shutterstock.comRoyal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) is another leading cruise line operator with a healthy 25% market share in the sector. Similar to its peers, RCL stock has been pulverized in the markets over the past couple of years. However, its business has bounced back from the pandemic with solid operating results.In its second quarter, the company posted a handsome revenue beat, with revenues skyrocketing from $50.9 million to $2.18 billion as it returned its entire fleet to operation. Moreover, despite posting a hefty loss in the quarter, Royal Caribbean’s management expects it to swing to GAAP profitability in the upcoming quarter.Perhaps one of the biggest advantages for RCL is that the majority of its long-term debt of $17.74 billion is tied to fixed interest rates. Hence, it’s effectively shielded from the effects of the Fed’s rampant rate hikes. Moreover, the company’s aggregate debt load is significantly less than its competitors. This bodes well for its long-term recovery.Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH)NCL, NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE (NCHL) SHIP GETAWAY, 13 July 2017 : Cruise liner Getaway are docked in Port of Sant Petersburg.Source: Nazar Skladanyi / Shutterstock.comNorwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) is another leading cruise line operator specializing in upscale cruising. Moreover, this company operates a world-class fleet, which continuously improves every year.Similar to its peers, NCLH is experiencing a resurgence of sorts. The company recently announced its final move to remove Covid-19 restrictions. It announced the removal of all testing, masking, and vaccination requirements. The removal of restrictions will likely lead to a massive surge in bookings in the upcoming quarters at prices above pre-pandemic levels.Analysts are already forecasting 2023 revenues for the company to reach $8 billion, a $1.5 billion improvement from 2019 levels. Moreover, analysts at UBS assigned a bullish rating to the stock, seeing its earnings per share price surging to $1.55 in 2023 compared to its prior forecast of $1.44. Moreover, UBS assigned a price target of $15, which represents nearly 25% upside from current prices.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Muslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

While 2021 saw big selloffs in weaker companies, 2022 has seen nearly universal selling across the growth stock sector.Many investors are understandably throwing in the towel on growth stocks. After such a bad run, people are rightly questioning many of the grand narratives that drove the previous bull market in the technology sector. On top of that, tailwinds associated with heightened digital adoption during the pandemic have reversed. Now, layoffs and cutbacks are the order of the day across Silicon Valley.However, it’s not all bad news.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn fact, for patient investors, the current chaos represents an opportunity. After seeing growth stocks soar last year, valuations have come back down to earth. The strongest growth stocks can consolidate during this down cycle and come out stronger. Astute investors can capitalize with these seven leading companies going forward.CRMSalesforce$158.75MSFTMicrosoft$238.41VVisa$188.99SNOWSnowflake$178.23DDOGDatadog$84.27SPOTSpotify$89.04TXNTexas Instruments$155.21Salesforce (CRM)A hand with pink painted fingernails holds a Salesforce sticker.Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.comBig software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies have become the latest victims of the ongoing selloff in tech stocks. Shares of leading graphics design company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) plummeted following its surprising and expensive acquisition of design firm Figma. Adobe’s plunge has set off a fresh round of selling in other leading SaaS giants like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).However, Adobe’s problems don’t apply to CRM stock. Salesforce has used more discipline in its big acquisitions; for example, Salesforce paid a reasonable price in acquiring workplace collaboration platform Slack. That Slack purchase was part of Salesforce’s gradual shift from just being a CRM company to one offering a far broader workplace solutions platform.Story continuesSalesforce has had one of the longest streaks of 20% annualized revenue growth on record among large-cap technology companies. The core product is also a sticky one; once enterprises put their key data into Salesforce, it usually stays there. CRM stock is now at 32 times this year’s estimated earnings and 28 times projected 2023 earnings, which is one of the better entry points we’ve seen for Salesforce historically.Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comFor awhile, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) appeared to be immune to the broader market selloff. However, even MSFT stock has now gotten dragged into the mess.MSFT stock has now fallen 15% over the past six months. Microsoft’s cash cow continues to be its dominant position with Windows and Office. However, the Azure cloud computing business has revolutionized Microsoft’s outlook. Azure is already producing more than $40 billion per year in revenues and is still growing at more than 40% per year. It’s simply breathtaking success for a company of Microsoft’s size and age.Right now, Microsoft is selling off on fears that Azure will slow down as its clients pull back on spending. That’s a valid concern. But Microsoft is a cash flow machine. It’s also selling for less than 25 times forward earnings now and earnings are still growing at a double-digit rate. Long story short, Microsoft is still a reliable blue-chip growth stock, and it’s now at its best entry point so far in 2022.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comShares of credit card giant Visa (NYSE:V) are also back near 52-week lows as V stock has slipped below the $200 mark. Traders appear to be selling off Visa shares again due to the macroeconomic environment.In theory, a slowing economy should hurt commerce and slow down velocity on credit card payments. The strong recovery in international tourism — which is vital to Visa’s profit margins — may also slow given mounting inflation and various geopolitical uncertainties this year.However, the negativity is getting out of hand. Visa doesn’t take credit risk; instead, its partner banks are on the hook for any non-payments. Visa gets paid a small cut of every transaction rather than lending money itself. And, it should be noted, with inflation soaring, overall transaction sizes are getting larger and larger, which means Visa’s revenues scale up naturally.There’s also a strong valuation appeal to V stock at today’s prices. In recent years, Visa has often traded around 35 times earnings or at even higher multiples. Now it is selling for less than 27 times forward. Throw in Visa’s earnings growth rate off that discounted starting valuation, and investors should enjoy fantastic returns from this entry point.Snowflake (SNOW)Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.Source: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockSnowflake was one of the market’s most anticipated initial public offerings (IPOs) when its shares debuted in 2020. The company has been growing at an exponential rate in recent years. And it is headed by legendary tech CEO Frank Slootman. All the pieces were there for success. Except for valuation.SNOW stock opened trading at $240 and made it up to $400 not long after. That briefly put shares at nearly 100x trailing revenues. Regardless of how great a business may be, it’s a gamble to buy a company at such a high starting ratio.Now, however, valuation has fallen into place. With SNOW stock under $200 per share, the market capitalization has fallen back to a more reasonable $60 billion. That’s roughly 30x revenues based on the estimated $2 billion of revenues for the current fiscal year. Meanwhile, revenues are still growing at around 50% per year, which is one of the fastest growth rates for a large-cap tech company.The issue with Snowflake was never business quality, but merely overvaluation. And now, after the tech bear market, SNOW stock is much more appropriately priced. This makes it one of the best growth stocks to buy now.Datadog (DDOG)The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.Source: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.comDatadog is a leading provider of monitoring and security services for cloud applications. The service operates across apps, networks, databases, code, workflow, servers and many other locations. In all, Datadog aims to give its customers an all-in-one platform that works everywhere instead of being confined to certain use case silos.Datadog’s platform has been incredibly successful in terms of driving adoption. The company had just $101 million of revenues in 2017. By the end of 2021, it had grown to $1 billion, making for a quick tenfold jump. Analysts see the company’s revenues surging to $2.2 billion for full-year 2023.Unlike many SaaS companies, Datadog has achieved bottom line financial results to complement the top-line growth. It has, for example, put up a 26% free cash flow margin over the past 12 months. The company, while not tremendously profitable, does also consistently earn positive earnings per share which puts it ahead of many rivals. Datadog’s $1.6 billion of cash on hand also ensures that the company won’t need to raise money during these trying market conditions.For a pure fast growth play, Datadog looks like one of the eventual winners once sentiment recovers.Spotify (SPOT)Spotify (SPOT) app on smartphone iPhone 13 Pro screen on green background.Source: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.comStreaming media stocks have gotten hammered over the past 12 months. Video streaming has gone from boom to bust as subscriber numbers roll over. Turns out, as the economy has reopened, demand for home entertainment has cooled. Unfortunately, this fall has hit music as well, with Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) losing the majority of its value over the past year.Unlike video, however, Spotify doesn’t have nearly as existential of a crisis. The competition for the television screen is brutal with a seemingly unending stream of new services undercutting Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Spotify, by contrast, is far and away the market leader in music and has a dominant position, especially in international markets.Spotify still has its issues. It pays out too much in royalties to record labels, which limits profitability. Over time, Spotify should be able to negotiate better royalties, but the market won’t believe it until it actually happens. And so-called streaming fatigue is a factor as well as demand for subscription services has waned following the pandemic.Regardless, Spotify is the clear leader in music, and the market will grow substantially in the long term. Patient investors are getting a solid entry point today.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments is a leader in the semiconductor industry. Specifically, it focuses on analog semiconductors, which are used in a variety of ways to convert real-world inputs such as wind speed or temperature into digital data, along with applications in fields such as audio and power systems.Analog is a great market, since it is more stable and slower-moving than other semiconductor fields. Texas Instruments can sell many of its designs for a decade or more, as opposed to semis for categories such as smartphones where the market changes radically every few years.Texas Instruments is in the sweet spot right now. Analog chips are vital for connected cars, internet of things applications, and other such niches with strong growth trajectories. Management’s focus on maximizing its free cash flow and hiking its dividend have proven shareholder-friendly during a time when so many other tech companies have failed to protect investors. All this makes TXN stock a great growth stock to own even as markets remain chaotic.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in SPOT, TXN, V and CRM stock.

Europe’s Energy Crisis Takes a Surprise TurnThe decision is connected with information in the public domain that Biren’s products outperform Nvidia Corp.’s A100 chips, which are now banned for the Chinese market, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter. While TSMC has not reached a conclusion on whether Biren’s products meet the US threshold for restrictions, the Taiwanese chipmaker has decided to stop supplies to the Chinese startup for now, the person said.Biren, one of China’s most promising semiconductor designers, earlier concluded its artificial intelligence chips produced by TSMC are not covered by the latest US export restrictions because the specs of its products don’t meet the criteria for curbs, Bloomberg reported on Friday.A representative for TSMC said the company complies with all relevant rules, and declined to comment further. No one at Shanghai-based Biren was immediately available to respond to requests for comment outside of regular business hours.US RestrictionsBiren is considered a domestic contender to compete with graphics chips from Nvidia, which has said it can no longer sell its most advanced AI products into China. The US measures were designed to limit China’s development of technology that may be used to aid its military, and appeared to rule out access to advanced fabrication.The US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which plays a key role in designing and enforcing export controls, announced the semiconductor restrictions on Oct. 7.Story continues“While BIS cannot comment on company-specific actions, we expect all companies to comply with export controls,” a Commerce Department spokesperson said in an response to an earlier Bloomberg query on TSMC’s business relationship with Biren. “Since the release of the rule on October 7, BIS has been undertaking a vigorous outreach effort to educate those impacted by it to aid compliance efforts.”TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, complies with all relevant regulations and “will continue to serve all customers around the world,” Chief Executive Officer C.C.

(NYSE:APD) Potentially Undervalued?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/air-products-chemicals-inc-nyse-112837463.html,1666610917,STORY,['APD'],"[Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$274 and falling to the lows of US$224. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Air Products and Chemicals' current trading price of US$241 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Air Products and Chemicals’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals What's The Opportunity In Air Products and Chemicals?Air Products and Chemicals is currently expensive based on my price multiple model, where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Air Products and Chemicals’s ratio of 23.98x is above its peer average of 14.18x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Chemicals industry. Another thing to keep in mind is that Air Products and Chemicals’s share price is quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards the levels of its industry peers over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard for it to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What does the future of Air Products and Chemicals look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Air Products and Chemicals' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 37%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? APD’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe APD should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on APD for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for APD, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

(WBD) was the first to adopt the hybrid release trend at the end of 2020, announcing that all of its 2021 films will have a day-and-date release on HBO Max, in addition to a cinematic rollout. The studio kept that promise throughout 2021 with top titles like ""Dune"" and ""The Matrix: Resurrections"" receiving the hybrid treatment.Disney soon followed its competitor's strategy with Marvel's highly anticipated ""Black Widow"" prequel released on Disney+ on July 9, 2021 — the same day as theaters.The decision caused Scarlett Johansson to sue the company over breach of contact. According to Johansson's team, her earnings potential was ""largely"" tied to box office performance, with Marvel promising the movie star that the film would receive a theatrical-only release.The Wall Street Journal estimated that Johansson lost out on over $50 million due to the shift away from an exclusively theatrical release. Disney settled with the actress two months later for a reported $40 million.US actress Scarlett Johansson poses on the red carpet upon arrival at the BAFTA British Academy Film Awards at the Royal Albert Hall in London on February 2, 2020.Although studios have since reverted back to box office exclusives with shortened theatrical windows, Johansson's lawsuit created a momentous ripple effect throughout Hollywood.Story continues""With regards to Scarlett Johansson, I was shortly thereafter negotiating a movie deal and we handled the negotiations completely different in the event that the movie would go straight to streaming,"" Drescher said, revealing that her movie ultimately did end up skipping a theatrical release and, instead, debuted on Amazon Prime Video (AMZN).As a result of her negotiations, influenced by Johansson, Drescher said she recently received a ""big chunky check"" for her work in the film.'We were the underdogs in this equation'SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher speaks during the SAG-AFTRA and NFL Players Association Celebrity brunch to launch the new ""Actors &amp; Athletes: Unions for Democracy"" campaign in Beverly Hills, California, on July 17, 2022.Since that time, SAG-AFTRA — which represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — has worked hand-in-hand with streaming giants to re-negotiate contracts in order to account for the shifting media landscape.""We just had a very successful negotiation with Netflix (NFLX),"" Drescher noted. The contract, which included significant changes benefiting background performers, stunt coordinators and dubbing performers, allows actors more freedom and flexibility to pick up jobs on other platforms.Drescher explained that, when talks first began, the union had suggested making incremental alterations to an existing contract — an approach that the actress passionately disagreed with.""I saw a convergence of opportunities that would probably not come along for a very long time,"" she said, adding that talks needed to be leveraged with a great deal of strength and conviction; otherwise, the union would ""forever be chasing after a different kind of a contract that's always just outside of our grasp.""The union struck a similar deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). The agreement outlined major improvements to ""exclusivity"" rules, which had previously prevented television series regulars on accepting new jobs while on hiatus.It's the journeyman actor, the middle class, that's always getting squeezed...Fran Drescher, SAG-AFTRA President""We were very lucky that they heard us. They understood that we were the underdogs in this equation,"" Drescher said.""The truth of the matter is that when an entire industry changes, and the rules of the game change on behalf of the employer, changes are going to have to trickle down to the employees as well. You can't have it both ways,"" she continued.Drescher emphasized that SAG-AFTRA's negotiations largely focus on ""the journeyman actor"" as A-list stars like Tom Hanks and Scarlett Johansson often make their own deals.""It's the journeyman actor, the middle class, that's always getting squeezed. That's really why unions exist — to protect and defend their rights,"" she stressed.'The gift that keeps on giving'Outside of SAG-AFTRA, Drescher — known for her role as Fran Fine in the popular CBS sitcom ""The Nanny"" — continues to work as an actress and producer.When asked about a potential ""Nanny"" film reboot, the 65-year-old said she'd be game to reprise her beloved character on the big screen.""It's in the talking stage — I would definitely be in. We'll see what happens,"" Drescher teased, adding that a Broadway musical based on the sitcom is currently in development.""['The Nanny'] is the gift that keeps on giving,"" she beamed, crediting the show's new life on HBO Max, which has led to a new generation of ""Nanny"" fans. ""For that, I'm very grateful.""Alexandra is a Senior Media and Entertainment Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

118,b2afa063-7ab3-3f69-bf12-72c59a027ca4,NDAQ,2022-10-24,RPT-Nasdaq halts IPOs of small Chinese companies as it probes stock rallies,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rpt-nasdaq-halts-ipos-small-100000884.html,1666605600,STORY,['NDAQ'],"[(Repeats story first published on Saturday.)By Echo WangNEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc has put the brakes on initial public offering (IPO) preparations of at least four small Chinese companies while it investigates short-lived stock rallies of such firms following their debuts, according to lawyers and bankers who work on such stock launches.The stock exchange operator's actions come amid a surge in the shares of Chinese companies that raise small amounts, typically $50 million or less, in their IPO. These stocks rise as much as 2,000% in their debuts, only to nosedive in the days that follow, bruising investors who are bold enough to speculate on penny stocks.Douglas Ellenoff, a corporate and securities attorney at Ellenoff Grossman &amp; Schole LLP, said he was informed by the Nasdaq that certain IPOs will not be allowed to proceed ""until they determined what has been the aberrational trading activity in certain Chinese issuers earlier this year.""""These were last-minute phone calls, just as we thought we were going to go somewhere with the deals,"" Ellenoff said.Nasdaq started asking the advisers of small Chinese IPO candidates questions in mid-September. The questions concerned the identity of their existing shareholders, where they reside, how much they are investing and if they were offered interest-free debt so they can participate, according to one of the bankers, Dan McClory, who is head of equity capital markets at Boustead Securities.The lawyers and bankers spoke to Reuters on condition that the names of the four companies whose IPOs were halted not be disclosed.It is not clear what action the Nasdaq will take once it completes its probe and whether all or some of the halted IPOs will be allowed to continue. A Nasdaq spokesman declined to comment.Seven sources who work on IPOs of small Chinese companies spoke to Reuters on the condition that neither they nor their clients be identified. These sources said that the ephemeral stock rallies were caused by a few overseas investors who concealed their identities and snapped up most of the shares in the offerings, creating the perception that the debuts were in demand.Story continuesAs a result, Chinese IPOs in the United States have returned this year on average a staggering 426% in their first day of trading, compared with 68% for all other IPOs, according to data from Dealogic.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other U.S. financial regulators have yet to announce a case of successfully prosecuting such pump-and-dump schemes because Chinese companies and their overseas bankers have so far been effective in carrying them out secretly, the seven sources said.An SEC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.LOOPHOLESNasdaq's intervention underscores how liquidity standards it adopted in the last three years to prevent stock manipulation in small IPOs have loopholes that Chinese companies are exploiting. The rules dictate that a company going public should have at least 300 investors holding at least 100 shares each, totaling a minimum of $2,500.Yet these requirements have not been sufficient to prevent trading manipulation in some penny stocks. Small Chinese companies have been attracted to Nasdaq's exchange rather than the New York Stock Exchange because the former has traditionally been the venue of red-hot technology startups - an image these companies often try to project.""Almost all of these microcap IPOs are 'story' stocks, where the promoters try to convince unsophisticated retail investors that this could be the next Moderna or this could be the next Facebook,"" said Jay Ritter, a University of Florida professor who studies IPOs.There have been 57 listings of small Chinese companies in the last five years, up from 17 listings in the prior five years, according to Dealogic. So far this year there have been nine such listings despite the U.S. IPO market facing its worst drought in nearly two decades due to market volatility fueled by the Federal Reserve raising interest rates to fight inflation.McClory said the trend highlights the looser regulatory requirements for listings in the United States compared with China. ""It is virtually impossible for these companies to list onshore in China, and now the Hong Kong market has completely shut down as well,"" he said.(Reporting by Echo Wang in New York Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Matthew Lewis)]"

URI is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 26, after market close.In the last reported quarter, United Rentals’ adjusted earnings and revenues topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19.6% and 2.8%, respectively. This largest equipment rental company’s second-quarter adjusted earnings and revenues grew 68.7% and 21.2% year over year, respectively.Markedly, its earnings surpassed expectations in 32 out of the last 36 quarters. The company’s revenues topped the consensus mark in 20 out of the trailing 21 quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings has increased to $9.00 from $8.89 per share over the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates 36.8% growth from the year-ago earnings of $6.58 per share. The consensus mark for revenues is $3.09 billion, suggesting a 19% year-over-year improvement.United Rentals, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Rentals, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Rentals, Inc. price-eps-surprise | United Rentals, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteThe company’s quarterly results are expected to benefit from solid mega-project activity. URI’s solid exposure to blue-chip engineering &amp; construction accounts, and industry-leading market share are expected to reflect in its quarterly performance.The company’s investment in the General Rental segment (wherein the primary growth drivers are non-residential construction and plant maintenance) also bodes well. Overall, construction and industrial markets are expected to have aided the company’s performance. On the industrial side, chemical, energy, processing, metals and mining and healthcare have been performing well. On the construction side, gains have mostly been from non-residential construction like warehouse, data center work and power.Higher pricing and improved activity level, backed by stronger demand in each of the end markets served in North America (industrial and other non-construction, and commercial construction), are expected to aid United Rentals’ third-quarter results.Furthermore, acquisitions (like that of General Finance Corporation and Franklin Equipment buyouts) are expected to have helped United Rentals to boost the top line in the quarter to be reported.Equipment Rentals revenues (accounting for more than 75% of its total revenues) are expected to have registered growth in the to-be-reported quarter.

121,7d615daf-58cc-3677-9577-bf9eb3070ee5,ORCL,2022-10-24,Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) Shares Could Be 43% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-corporation-nyse-orcl-shares-110025268.html,1666609225,STORY,['ORCL'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Oracle What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.9bUS$13.4bUS$16.4bUS$20.1bUS$21.6bUS$22.7bUS$23.6bUS$24.4bUS$25.2bUS$25.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x15Analyst x16Analyst x10Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 5.08%Est @ 4.15%Est @ 3.5%Est @ 3.04%Est @ 2.72% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$10.1kUS$11.5kUS$13.1kUS$14.9kUS$14.8kUS$14.4kUS$13.9kUS$13.3kUS$12.7kUS$12.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$131bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$26b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.0%) = US$448bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$448b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$210bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$341b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$72.7, the company appears quite undervalued at a 43% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Oracle as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.256. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Oracle, we've compiled three additional factors you should explore:Risks: You should be aware of the 4 warning signs for Oracle (2 are concerning!) we've uncovered before considering an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does ORCL's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

(NASDAQ:MU) insiders",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/selling-us-13m-worth-stock-110043680.html,1666609243,STORY,['MU'],"[Last week, Micron Technology, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MU) stock jumped 6.3%, but insiders who sold US$13m worth of stock in over the past year are likely to be in a better position. Selling at an average price of US$95.01, which is higher than the current price might have been the right call as holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Micron Technology Micron Technology Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Vice President of Global Operations, Manish Bhatia, for US$9.3m worth of shares, at about US$96.02 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$56.05. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.All up, insiders sold more shares in Micron Technology than they bought, over the last year. The sellers received a price of around US$95.01, on average. Insider selling doesn't make us excited to buy. But we note that the selling, on average, was at well above the recently traded price of US$56.05. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Micron Technology better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Micron Technology Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyThere was some insider buying at Micron Technology over the last quarter. Executive Vice President of Technology &amp; Products Scott DeBoer bought US$35k worth of shares in that time. It's good to see the insider buying, as well as the lack of recent sellers. However, in this case the amount invested recently is quite small.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Micron Technology insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$190m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Micron Technology Insider Transactions Indicate?We note a that there has been a bit of insider buying recently (but no selling). The net investment is not enough to encourage us much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we'd need to see more buying to gain confidence from the Micron Technology insider transactions. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for Micron Technology and we suggest you have a look.Of course Micron Technology may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions, but not derivative transactions.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $5,711 million. The metric suggests a deterioration of 7.9% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Let's take a look at how things have shaped up in the quarter.Factors at PlayMcDonald's third-quarter performance is likely to be negatively impacted by a decline in internationally operated market revenues. The company’s performance in China is likely to be negatively impacted by softening economy and COVID-related government restrictions. We expect total internationally operated market revenues in third-quarter 2022 to be down nearly 12% year over year.However, the robust performance of the U.S segment is likely to have boosted the top line. We expect total U.S. segment revenues in third-quarter 2022 to be up nearly 0.4% year over year. Digital efforts, strong marketing campaigns, robust drive-thru presence and expansion initiatives are likely to have aided the results. Moreover, increase in average check growth, menu price increases and compelling value programs also bode well.However, inflationary pressures are likely to have hurt the margin.

The company now expects revenues to be $2.1 billion (+/- $100 million) compared with the previous guidance of revenues of $2.5 billion (+/- $150 million).Owing to lower revenues, higher under-utilization charges and a less favorable product mix are expected to result in a quarter-over-quarter decline in margins.

The lingering supply chain issues and component shortages are added headwinds.In September, the company noted that since its last earnings call in July 2022, several Asian countries have been facing weaker-than-expected economic trends, leading to increased customer inventory corrections and exacerbated supply chain disruptions. Cautious spending patterns by customers, including global enterprises, OEMs and certain domestic cloud clients, are likely to affect demand for mass capacity solutions in the near term, prompting a downward revision for fiscal first-quarter revenue guidance.To safeguard itself from the ongoing global economic disturbances, Seagate noted that it was focused on lowering production output, cutting costs and streamlining the current year’s capital investment plan.Moreover, declining trends witnessed in PC shipments in the third quarter of the calendar year 2022 are likely to have negatively impacted HDD sales in the company’s performance in the quarter under review.However, Seagate is likely to have witnessed continued strong demand for its mass storage capacity solutions, especially nearline products, driven by strong cloud data center demand and recovery in the enterprise market in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s mass capacity portfolio is also expected to have witnessed incremental gains from multiple varieties of its 20-terabyte drives in addition to 18-terabyte drives. Seagate’s Lyve Cloud business is likely to have seen healthy traction among customers.

Last month, FedEx pulled its full-year guidance, blaming a steep drop in global demand.""They're better business people, they execute better, (and) they're consistently, significantly more profitable than FedEx,"" Dean Maciuba, a former FedEx sales executive turned industry advisor, said of UPS.UPS seems to have done a better job spotting and responding to the slowdown that hammered FedEx, which had too many planes in the air and trucks on the road, analysts and investors said.They pointed to Atlanta-based UPS keeping its financial outlook for the year unchanged even though FedEx's warning gave them cover to make a change.At the same time, the UPS sales team has been working to drum up new business. One recent win came at the expense of FedEx, according to two people familiar with the matter.Lego, the $7.3 billion Danish maker of colorful plastic bricks used to build everything from UPS delivery trucks to Hogwarts Castle of Harry Potter fame, switched from FedEx to UPS, according to the sources, who asked not to be identified.None of the companies involved would comment on the deal. FedEx said it is not unusual for customers to move from carrier to carrier based on specific needs.UPS is on track to report in-line third-quarter earnings, supported by stable domestic volumes and cost controls, UBS analysts said in a recent note.Still, there are significant challenges ahead.Story continuesGlobal air and ocean import cargo volumes, a gauge of demand for logistics companies like UPS and FedEx, are slumping.Customer response to Amazon.com's pre-holiday sale this month was tepid - suggesting muted delivery demand from UPS's largest customer as inflation and recession worries temper expectations for the year-end festive season.And analysts have downbeat expectations for the U.S. economy next year, when the contract between UPS and its unionized drivers and package handlers expires - exposing the company to the risk of a work stoppage and higher employee costs.(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and Shivansh Tiwary in Bengaluru; Editing by Ben Klayman and Nick Zieminski)]"

This will combine PPL's extensive experience in building and operating large-scale onshore transmission in the U.S. with Elia Group's proven track record in building, integrating and operating offshore transmission, including high-voltage direct current (HVDC) networks.""As the U.S. seeks to accelerate the development of offshore wind to advance a cleaner energy future, it's essential that we prepare to integrate that wind generation as reliably and efficiently as possible to strengthen grid resilience and keep energy affordable,"" said Vincent Sorgi, president and chief executive officer of PPL Corporation. ""Both PPL and Elia Group are at the forefront of grid innovation, and together with WindGrid, we intend to leverage our shared vision and deep expertise to propose solutions that advance decarbonization goals, enhance energy security and drive value for consumers.""Later this month, PPL and WindGrid plan to jointly respond to a request for information (RFI) issued by five New England states that are seeking input from interested stakeholders relating to the transmission system changes and upgrades that are needed to integrate future renewable energy resources into their grids.The states – Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine and New Hampshire – recognize the importance of early planning for carrying out this offshore wind development. Recent studies, including Massachusetts' Energy Pathways to Deep Decarbonization report, which is cited in the RFI, assume that up to 30,000 megawatts of New England offshore wind capacity will be deployed by 2050.Story continues""Both PPL and Elia Group share the same open mind and vision regarding innovative offshore transmission solutions,"" said Chris Peeters, CEO of Elia Group. ""By uniting our complementary skills and building on the experience Elia Group has built up in Europe, we want to undertake offshore development in the interest of society. PPL is a reliable and robust player in the U.S. energy sector. Our values and ambitions in terms of driving the energy transition are well matched.""For more than 25 years, Elia Group has been a front-runner in offshore electricity transmission. Through its subsidiaries in Belgium (Elia) and Germany (50Hertz), the company has connected 14 wind farms (3,500 MW by the end of 2022) to its onshore grid and is currently operating three HVDC subsea cable interconnectors. The company built the world's first hybrid interconnector (an interconnector that is connected to three offshore wind farms) and has pioneered many innovative projects and approaches, including the first offshore alternating current grid in Germany and the use of X-ray technology for offshore cable inspections.New innovative projects are on their way. Elia Group is currently developing the world's first energy islands that will form the building blocks of an integrated European offshore grid. These offshore electricity hubs will link wind farms and HVDC interconnectors to multiple European countries. All of Elia's projects are realized in close partnership with wind developers, other grid operators and international partners across the value chain.Elia Group's transmission system has a reliability rate of 99.99%, and like PPL, the company continues to invest in advanced technology and digitalization.Through its subsidiaries, PPL Corporation has invested more than $9 billion in transmission in the U.S. over the past decade, part of more than $30 billion invested overall in utility infrastructure and technology. The company has significant experience engaging with a wide range of stakeholders to successfully site new transmission projects and working with regional transmission organizations to strengthen grid resilience. PPL is an industry leader in deploying smart grid technology and automation to drive value for customers and operates one of the nation's most reliable electricity networks.About PPL CorporationPPL Corporation (NYSE: PPL), based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is a leading U.S. energy company focused on providing electricity and natural gas safely, reliably and affordably to 3.5 million customers in the U.S. PPL's high-performing, award-winning utilities are addressing energy challenges head-on by building smarter, more resilient and more dynamic power grids and advancing sustainable energy solutions.

Indeed, last year, many market participants bemoaned that their favorite opportunities became priced into the stratosphere. Now, the volatility presents a time machine of sorts.Fundamentally, the downgrade in the equities sector (and thus the opportunity in red-hot stocks) centers on the Federal Reserve. Early in the coronavirus pandemic, the central bank implemented dovish policies to bolster the devastated economy. Now, the Fed must unwind prior to monetary excesses. To do that, it committed to a hawkish strategy.However, the challenge moving forward is that Wall Street organically adjusted for the implied rise in interest rates, which increases the cost of borrowing and thus reduces the incentive for business expansion. That’s deflationary to the economy, which explains the red-hot stocks on discount.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor the intrepid contrarian, here are some compelling cheapened market ideas to consider.LCIDLucid$12.70VALEVale$13.86SMRNuScale Power$11.30INTUIntuit$402.06FIVEFive Below$132.51WRBYWarby Parker$13.80NFLXNetflix$273.14Lucid (LCID)Exterior of Lucid Motors (LCID) buildingSource: gg5795 / Shutterstock.comAlthough analysts often state that electric vehicles represent the future of mobility, 2022 provided a different narrative. Few if any EV manufacturers avoided the pressure that stemmed from escalating inflation, supply chain disruptions, and other major headwinds. Among them, premium EV maker Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) suffered a dramatic erosion in its equity value.To be fair, the red ink isn’t exactly unjustified. Still featuring elements of an aspirational enterprise, Lucid only recently began posting sales. For instance, in the second quarter of 2022, the company generated revenue of $97.3 million. That’s a far cry from the $200,000 generated in the year-ago period. Nevertheless, with its retained earnings line item coming in at a loss of $6.38 billion, Lucid has much work to do.Story continuesIf you have a contrarian spirit, LCID may qualify as one of the red-hot stocks to snap up. Per Kelley Blue Book, the average price of a new EV stands at nearly $63,000. With the median household income currently near $71,000, buying an EV is not realistic for most families. However, Lucid makes no bones about currently catering exclusively to affluent buyers. Therefore, LCID might succeed where others stumbled.Vale (VALE)the Vale logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's webpage in the backgroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comAs difficult as circumstances are for EVs right now, it’s very possible that this sector indeed represents the future. However, prospective investors must exercise caution. After all, the sector may be the future but no brand offers an exclusive guarantee. But that’s where metals and mining firm Vale (NYSE:VALE) enters the frame.According to its corporate profile, Vale is the world’s largest producer of nickel. Fundamentally, this fact offers significant upside implications as nickel represents a critical component of EV batteries. Further, management itself sees global demand for the metal increasing by 44% by 2030, citing EV-related demand.To be fair, against a year-to-date framework, VALE lost less than 3%. However, against April’s peak, VALE slipped nearly 37%. That’s a sizable discount among red-hot stocks that’s difficult to ignore. Moreover, Gurufocus.com labels the enterprise as modestly undervalued.For one thing, VALE features a forward price-earnings ratio of under 5 times, below the sector median of 9.3 times. Also, the company features growth and profitability metrics that rank within the top echelon of the mining industry. This is one of the red-hot stocks to pick up because its discount doesn’t make much sense.NuScale Power (SMR)A hand in silhouette holds up a phone displaying the logo for Nuscale in front of a display showing the company's website.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOne of my favorite red-hot stocks to discuss (quite literally in this case), NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR) may represent the future of nuclear energy. Unlike traditional nuclear-based facilities, NuScale specializes in small modular reactors or SMRs. These powerplants enjoy a smaller footprint that’s much easier to integrate across diverse geographies. Essentially, then, NuScale can bring nuclear power closer to the source of demand.While the sector carries certain unfortunate controversies, this segment is not going anywhere. No other power source features the same energy density as uranium. Moreover, nuclear facilities command the highest capacity factor or measurement of reliability.What makes NuScale so special is that its modular platform effectively enables power decentralization; that is, rather than one giant facility, NuScale can spread the energy footprint with several smaller SMRs. Most importantly, NuScale integrates its SMR design with innovative safety features.Since its August peak, SMR slipped around 25%. While the company’s financials leave much to be desired, the long-term narrative is too compelling to ignore. It’s easily one of the red-hot stocks to pick up on a discount.Intuit (INTU)APPS stock: A digital illustration of software icons surrounding a cellphone.Source: ShutterstockWhile I wouldn’t classify the phenomenon as groundbreaking as Friedrich Engels’ and Karl Marx’s “The Communist Manifesto,” a worker revolution nevertheless materialized recently. As fears of the Covid-19 pandemic faded, many employers became more aggressive regarding their return-to-the-office protocols. To no one’s surprise, millions of workers cried bloody murder. At least some of these folks will enter the gig economy, which bodes well for Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU).Best known for its tax and accounting software, Intuit natively presents a relevant profile. Taxes can be complicated despite various political initiatives to make them less so. However, as fresh faces expand the gig economy, they’ll soon discover that taxes for independent contractors (gig workers) are much different from those who are corporate employees.Succinctly, the difference between the 1099 and W2 tax forms centers on the magnitude of involvement. With the latter, the company automates most of the details. But with the former, the freelancer must keep accurate books to prepare taxes appropriately (and legally). In my opinion, Intuit’s tax software should help lessen the blow and ease the learning curve.Still, Wall Street imposed a 36% discount on INTU. That seems aggressive given the relevancies. Therefore, it’s one of the red-hot stocks to buy.Five Below (FIVE)Retail workers checking produce at a grocery store.Source: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.comI keep using the word relevant throughout this list of red-hot stocks but I really mean it with Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE). An American chain of specialty discount stores, shoppers can find great deals here. Plus, the company provides itself with a more upscale appearance and ambiance compared to literal discount dollar stores. Moving forward, FIVE offers a balanced approach to what might come next.Obviously, if inflation dominates the monetary landscape despite the Fed’s best efforts, then discount retailers will rule the day. At some point, hard-hit consumers will swallow their pride and pivot more of their funds to stores like Five Below.But let’s say for argument’s sake that deflation becomes the dominant trend. Even so, FIVE provides confidence for stakeholders. That’s because deflation – fewer dollars chasing after more goods – implies a hurting labor market. The net result is largely the same: hard-hit consumers seek good deals to help make ends meet.Yet FIVE declined by nearly 35% YTD. More enticingly, Gurufocus.com labels the business as significantly undervalued. Prominently, Five Below carries a return on equity of nearly 22%, ranking better than 81% of its peers. It’s easily one of the red-hot stocks to buy.Warby Parker (WRBY)market news glasses 1600Source: ShutterstockAt first glance, discount eyewear specialist Warby Parker (NYSE:WRBY) doesn’t seem like a natural idea for red-hot stocks to buy. Since the start of the year, WRBY dropped almost 69% of its equity value. Furthermore, its financial status is messy. For instance, the company ranks in negative territory for key metrics like return on equity or return on assets. Nevertheless, contrarians may want to give WRBY a closer look.For instance, while it’s true that the company suffered wider-than-expected losses in Q2, it also posted sales of $149.6 million. This tally came out just ahead of the FactSet consensus of $149.5 million. Interestingly, WRBY gained substantially following the earnings disclosure as speculators bid up the security. Over the trailing month, shares gained nearly 3%.Fundamentally, Warby Parker benefits from a cynical but powerful catalyst. Researchers project that by 2050, nearly half of the global population will suffer from myopia (nearsightedness). Further, the available evidence in the U.S. indicates that Americans will not be spared from this unfavorable trend. Thus, WRBY is worth considering among discounted red-hot stocks.Netflix (NFLX)An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed acrossSource: xalien / ShutterstockEarly in the Covid-19 crisis, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) rapidly emerged as one of the top cynical beneficiaries. Fundamentally, the pandemic shut down collegiate and professional sports leagues. With no reason to have expensive TV subscriptions, many then cut the cord. However, Netflix acting as its own content generator helped provide much-needed entertainment to the masses.Unfortunately for Netflix, binging on various programs got old. As Covid restrictions faded, people rushed out the door, leading to significant subscriber losses and crimson stains on the financials. Invariably, NFLX eroded this year.However, the streaming giant recently posted encouraging results for its Q3 report. Moreover, increased traffic data suggests that the entertainment ecosystem is beginning to normalize. Whether people got tired of their vacations or simply didn’t have the money to continue their outward trek, more consumers are returning to their living rooms. That’s music to Netflix’s ears.Despite the massive jump in NFLX following its earnings disclosure, shares are still down over 54% YTD.

After all, these troubles likely won’t be a permanent affair. And at some point, the broader economy must get on with the business of moving on.To be clear, you don’t want to get reckless with growth stocks. Certainly, with few market ideas in this segment offering dividends or other benefits associated with value names, growth-focused ideas present risks. At the same time, if you have a longer-term horizon, companies tied to intriguing fundamentals may see dramatic resurgences.Therefore, if you have the patience (and the nerve), these discounted growth stocks to buy should be on your radar.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPYPLPayPal$87.20INTUIntuit$407SESea Limited$50NVDANvidia$126.85AVAVAeroVironment$78.42ASMLASML$441.59VSTOVista Outdoor$26.18PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAlthough PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) represents one of the riskiest growth stocks to buy, it’s also compelling because of its implications for the burgeoning gig economy. First, let’s acknowledge the pain which PYPL suffers from. Since the start of this year, the security has tanked nearly 54%. It’s difficult to ignore such catastrophic losses.At the same time, since July 14, PYPL gained 25%. For me, that’s the real narrative for the underlying company, which provides digital payment services. In addition, PayPal delivers useful business applications for entrepreneurs, making it a friend to the gig economy. This arena of independent contractors will likely generate $455.2 billion of gross volume, according to Statista.com.True, several upstart competitors exist that could take the shine off PayPal. Here’s what’s important to remember, though. PayPal has been around for a long time. That carries tremendous social cachet. Further, when dealing with money, brand awareness and trust go a long way. Thus, PYPL is an easy name among growth stocks to buy on the dip.Story continuesIntuit (INTU)Intuit and turbotax logo on a phone screen on top of a keyboard. INTU stock.Source: Julio Ricco / ShutterstockOn a related note regarding the gig economy, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) deserves attention as one of the growth stocks to advantage. Best known for its tax and accounting software, should the pivot to the gig economy accelerate, Intuit will likely enjoy increased demand. Fundamentally, tax preparation for independent contractors presents much more complexities than a standard W2 filing for employees.In my view, the gig economy should enjoy increased participation thanks to the massive return-to-the-office debate. In short, worker bees want to continue telecommuting while upper management wants them to return.I’m siding with the latter for two reasons. First, companies sign the checks so they have leverage. Second, employees can’t have it both ways, where they enjoy the security and benefits of employment yet also make their own rules.Should a recession materialize, corporations will enjoy even greater leverage. That may inspire several holdouts to become fulltime gig workers, which will invariably boost Intuit. Again, gig worker taxes are much more complicated than employee taxes.Sea Limited (SE)SEA Limited - Shopee app on mobile phoneSource: Muh.Imron / Shutterstock.comTo be fair, the narrative for Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) presents many concerns and fears. Anytime a public company loses almost 78% of market value on a year-to-date basis, anxieties come to the forefront. It would be strange if they didn’t. Further, such emotional catalysts represent a protective mechanism that human traders would be wise to listen to.Getting that caveat out of the way, for risk-tolerant investors that have a long-term time horizon, SE appears compelling. In a way, Reuters last year laid out the bullish narrative for Sea Limited, a Singapore-based tech conglomerate that features businesses in digital entertainment, e-commerce and financial technologies (fintech).According to the news agency, “Southeast Asia’s internet economy is forecast to reach $1 trillion by 2030, as tens of millions more people take up online shopping and embrace food delivery.”Of course, the various woes of this year greatly and negatively affected sentiment. Nevertheless, once the troubles fade, SE could skyrocket, making it one of the growth stocks to consider.Nvidia (NVDA)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.Source: ShutterstockAmong popular growth stocks to buy, semiconductor specialist and tech innovator Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) suffered some of the steepest losses. Since the January opener, NVDA finds itself below parity to the tune of 56%. A victim of the supply chain woes that impacted the semiconductor industry, Nvidia navigated extraordinary circumstances. Still, it incurred a double whammy on a fundamental basis.First, the cryptocurrency sector melted down this year following a massive outbreak in 2021. Actually, cryptos looked incredibly healthy up until November of last year. With the demand profile of blockchain mining processors fading dramatically, Nvidia could no longer rely on this remarkable revenue channel.Second, the tech firm also suffered from revenge travel. Essentially, after being locked down or otherwise stymied for approximately two years, consumers eagerly wanted to enjoy “real” experiences. Therefore, video-gaming demand declined and thus, so did Nvidia’s audience (since gaming is the company’s forte).However, Nvidia also offers myriad relevancies across the innovation sphere, from machine learning to autonomous vehicles to data centers. Thus, for the patient investor, NVDA represents one of the growth stocks to buy on the dip.AeroVironment (AVAV)The logo for AeroVironment (AVAV) is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOn a wider scale, defense contractor AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) wouldn’t ordinarily classify as one of the growth stocks to buy on the dip. That’s because on a YTD basis, AVAV is not offering any kind of dip, skyrocketing 27%. For comparison’s sake, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is down 22% during the same period.Currently, AeroVironment generates plenty of attention because of its Switchblade drones. In short, these weapons systems enable operators to stand at a safe distance while flying drones, looking for targets. Once identified, the unmanned aerial vehicle slams into the target, destroying or disabling it. The system helped Ukrainian resistance forces battle against the invading Russian military.With fighting ongoing, defense contractors may cynically see increased relevancies.ASML (ASML)Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboardSource: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockSemiconductor specialist ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) presents a circumstance where its market performance doesn’t reflect the long-term fundamentals. For instance, ASML plunged more than 44% on a YTD basis. On the surface, such a dour performance wouldn’t encourage investors to consider it one of the growth stocks to buy. However, the longer-term framework provides plenty of potential for ASML.According to CNBC, the semiconductor firm is the only company in the world making extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. Essentially, these machines enable organizations to print specific patterns on silicon, enabling distinction among the various semiconductor firms. True, the global supply chain disruption disproportionately impacted the chip-manufacturing industry. Still, unless you believe that EUV lithography will become anachronistic, ASML offers an intriguing discount.If you need a little more nudging, Gurufocus.com labels ASML as modestly undervalued. Perhaps not surprisingly because of its lithography monopoly, it features excellent profitability metrics.Vista Outdoor (VSTO)the Vista Outdoor logo is displayed on a smartphoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comOne of the most controversial growth stocks to buy, Vista Outdoor (NYSE:VSTO) may intrigue investors. As an owner of various outdoors brands, Vista has several ammunition companies under its belt. In the market, VSTO finds itself down 43% YTD. However, this red ink might not last indefinitely.As mentioned earlier, the revenge travel phenomenon benefitted some businesses while hurting others. Fundamentally, Vista represents one of the beneficiaries because more people seeking real experiences could potentially leader to greater sales for its outdoors-related products.The other segment is ammo. Looking purely at government data regarding background checks for firearms purchased at retail locations, demand for the shooting sports surged dramatically in the post-pandemic new normal. Effectively, this dynamic sets up an expanded addressable market for Vista.Yes, it’s cynical and I understand the hesitation involved with this industry. At the same time, these sales numbers don’t lie, making VSTO one of the growth stocks to consider.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

137,23363e81-31ac-314e-a90d-d90ce1641482,SYK,2022-10-24,Positive week for Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) institutional investors who lost 20% over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/positive-week-stryker-corporation-nyse-110039402.html,1666609239,STORY,['SYK'],"[A look at the shareholders of Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 77% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).After a year of 20% losses, last week’s 4.4% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Stryker. See our latest analysis for Stryker ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Stryker?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Stryker already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Stryker's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Stryker. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 7.8% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.7% by the third-largest shareholder. Ronda Stryker, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Member of the Board of Directors.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 12 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of StrykerThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Stryker Corporation. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$9.2b stake in this US$83b business. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Stryker. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Stryker (including 1 which shouldn't be ignored) .If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

PFG is slated to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 27, after market close. PFG delivered an earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, the average being 11.61%.Factors at PlayPrincipal Financial third-quarter results are likely to reflect higher variable investment income, higher earnings from equity method investments, growth in the Specialty Benefits business, positive market returns and lower expenses.Premiums in the Retirement and Income Solutions segment are likely to have decreased due to lower sales of the single premium group and exited individual annuities with life contingencies.Investment income is expected to have benefited from higher variable investment income, growth in invested assets, higher inflation-based investment returns on Latin America average invested assets and cash as well as the sale of certain value-add real estate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net investment income is pegged at $833 million. We expect net investment income to be $932.1 million.Higher earnings from equity method investments in Brazil, higher inflation-based investment returns on average invested assets and cash and favorable relative market performance on required regulatory investments are likely to have benefited revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Growth in the Specialty Benefits business and Individual Life insurance business, primarily related to the Reinsurance Transaction, is likely to have added to the top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $3.1 billion, indicating a decline of 15.7% from the year-ago quarter reported figure. We expect total revenues to be $3.2 billion.Assets under management is likely to have benefited from favorable market performance, higher net customer cash flow and positive market returns.Expenses are likely to have decreased due to lower benefits, claims and settlement expenses and dividends to policyholders. We expect total expenses to be $2.9 billion.Operating expenses are likely to have increased due to an increase in strategic review costs and impacts related to the exited business. The increase is likely to have been partially offset by a decrease in amounts credited to employee accounts in a nonqualified defined contribution pension plan. We expect operating expenses to be $1.1 billion.Continued share buybacks are likely to have provided additional upside to the bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2022 earnings stands at $1.45 per share, indicating a decline of 14.2% from the year-ago reported figure.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Principal Financial this time around.

142,94741b49-a3f5-3516-a609-1c54f1a38992,AFL,2022-10-24,3 Retirement Stocks That Won’t Be Mauled by a Bear Market,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-retirement-stocks-won-t-190719367.html,1666292839,STORY,"['AFL', 'FLO']","[This year has been a horrible one for investors thus far. That said, there’s now opportunity for those who may be looking for retirement stocks to buy in a bear market. Amid a gloomy September inflation report, it appears inflation data have yet to capitulate. This likely means more rate hikes from the Federal Reserve on the horizon, which could extend this bear market out.However, it’s not all doom and gloom out there. This downturn has created many buying opportunities for contrarian investors. Sure, it is difficult to predict where the market will bottom, but historically speaking, every stock market downturn has always been the best time to buy for investors looking for higher long-term returns.Of course, many investors still don’t have the appetite for this bear market’s risk profile. That said, for those looking to shield assets from further volatility, I believe these are among the best retirement stocks to buy during a bear market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBRK.BBerkshire Hathaway$274.97AFLAflac$59.69FLOFlowers Foods$26.67Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)A Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) sign sits out front of an office in Lafayette, Indiana.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to finding retirement stocks to buy, watching what the Oracle of Omaha does is a great place to start. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) is a highly-diversified conglomerate with its hands on almost every industry. The company has a massive portfolio, with significant positions in some of the biggest companies on the stock market, often hand-picked by Buffett himself. Accordingly, Berkshire Hathaway stock is undoubtedly one investors can count on during a market downturn.Berkshire Hathaway owns a stake in many essential businesses that do well in any economic climate. Due to the company’s diversification, it has survived numerous recessions and is on a stable long-term uptrend alongside the broader economy. Thus, it is hard to see BRK stock disappointing investors in the long-term.Story continuesIn Q2, the company reported a considerable $76.1 billion in revenue, which amounted to year-over-year growth of 10.2%. These results came in despite the market turmoil we’ve seen of late. And while some investors may find its quarterly loss of $43.8 billion worrying, I think it’s more tied to macro issues than company-specific problems. All in all, there is relatively little risk in holding Berkshire Hathaway over the very long-term.Aflac (AFL)the Aflac (AFL) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comInsurance services are vital. Whether there is a recession or hyperinflation, Americans will continue to pay for insurance, regardless. Aflac (NYSE:AFL) is the largest supplemental insurance provider in the U.S., making it among the safest retirement stocks to buy for a bear market.AFL stock has battled other difficult economic periods and recessions in the past. That said, this company has rebounded stronger every time. Additionally, given the fact this company has outperformed the broader market during this downturn, it appears history can be investors’ guide when it comes to this stock. Even if things deteriorate, it’s hard to imagine that Aflac would have any problems continuing on its long-term uptrend when the market stabilizes.Despite declining revenue for the past year, Aflac is a stable and profitable business that can thrive in the long term. Aflac has a low price-to-earnings ratio of 9-times, and has been hiking its dividends for 39 consecutive years. Its forward dividend yield sits at 2.7%.In addition, with inflation heading higher, people need to pay more for out-of-pocket healthcare costs that major medical health insurance providers don’t cover. Therefore, Aflac could attract more customers as inflation heats up.Flowers Foods (FLO)A photo of various food packaging containers.Source: Pixel-Shot / Shutterstock.comFlowers Foods (NYSE:FLO) is a company investors can depend on in times of volatility. Compared to Berkshire Hathaway and Aflac, Flowers Foods has a small market capitalization of $5.7 billion. Despite this market cap differential, it is among the least-volatile stocks in the market.The resilience of FLO stock is exceptional, and the same can be said for its stability. Flowers Foods is on a stable long-term uptrend and has shrugged away recessions in the past with little impact. For example, the stock shed around 30% of its value from its peak in 2008 and recovered within three years. In 2020, it declined by 17% but was back to its previous share price within a month. Even in 2022, it is only down 2.4% year-to-date, at the time of writing.Moreover, the company’s long-term performance closely resembles the S&amp;P500. FLO stock has gained 43.4% in the past five years, whereas the S&amp;P500 gained 43.5%. The difference is that investors holding Flowers Foods were in much less panic during 2020 and are doing much better so far in 2022. In other words, it’s a much less-volatile stock, something which carries inherent value for certain investor types.Additionally, Flowers Foods has generated stable revenue growing at a double-digit pace over the past two quarters. It also offers a forward dividend yield of 3.3% with 19 consecutive years of dividend increases. Thus, I believe FLO stock is one of the best retirement options to buy right now.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) has a market capitalization of $77.327 billion.RGA Investment Advisors made the following comment about Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) has been a stalwart of our portfolio for several years now. The company is investing mightily in R&amp;D to capitalize on their platform for innovation, moving into oncology, nearly 10% of their market cap in cash and potent cash generation each year fueling this investment. We think the oncology pipeline is valued at either $0 or less by many analysts out there, meanwhile we think it is an emerging platform, leveraging REGN’s dual discovery platforms of the Regeneron Genomics Center (RGC) and the VelociSuite. Recently the company presented initial data on the CD28 target which could be a profound breakthrough in the treatment of hard cancers. Although trial outcomes remain years away, the value of the oncology pipeline is certainly greater than zero. Why else would the recent President and CEO of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center join the board of directors were there not belief behind the pipeline in immunology?[22] It seems like an opportunity to us that Wall Street does not share this enthusiasm. Beyond the company’s core competency in antibodies, REGN has leveraged its RGC and Veloci-Suite into impactful partnerships with CGT industry leaders like Alnylam (ALNY) and Jennifer Doudna’s Intellia (NTLA). These partnerships include equity stakes and shared costs and revenues for key pieces of these respective company’s pipelines.”Story continuesRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CSCO)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-cisco-systems-110057213.html,1666609257,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$49.37 and falling to the lows of US$39.27. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Cisco Systems' current trading price of US$42.80 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Cisco Systems’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems Is Cisco Systems Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Cisco Systems is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Cisco Systems’s ratio of 14.88x is below its peer average of 24.19x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Communications industry. Cisco Systems’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its industry peers, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.What kind of growth will Cisco Systems generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 17% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Cisco Systems. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since CSCO is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CSCO for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CSCO. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Diving deeper into the forecasts for Cisco Systems mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

Fundamentally, this market segment offers tremendous relevancies as it undergirds societal progress. At the same time, investors must respect the macroeconomic dynamics that affect valuations.Primarily, all eyes focus on the Federal Reserve and its hawkish monetary policy. During the initial onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the central bank initiated accommodative programs to buttress the economy. Now, the Fed must unwind prior monetary excesses, which if performed too aggressively may lead to a recession. Naturally, such deflationary forces would put a negative slant on tech stock predictions.Generally speaking, though, I’m optimistic about specific tech players that command significant demand structures. Again, society attempts to move forward, not backward. Nevertheless, I will provide two sets of tech stock predictions (one bullish, one bearish) for each of the companies below.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIBMIBM.$127.68MSFTMicrosoft$236.97GOOGAlphabet$101.29CSCOCisco$41.94METAMeta Platforms$133.26ROVRRover Group$3.98COINCoinbase$63.72IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVWhen it comes to tech stock predictions for 2023, I don’t expect too many folks to discuss IBM (NYSE:IBM). Though presenting many powerful applications, IBM represents a legacy tech firm. As a result, it carries a reputation for focusing too much on hardware, even though that’s no longer the case. It’s created an unusual situation where Big Blue has become a powerful investment stuck in the background.No matter what, forward-thinking investors can use this dynamic to their advantage. For instance, IBM offers a forward yield of 5.4%, far above the technology sector’s average yield of 1.37%. While the company’s payout ratio is fairly lofty at 66.5%, it also commands 28 years of consecutive dividend increases. More than likely, management doesn’t want to abandon this status so the yield should be safe.Story continuesCombined with its innovations in artificial intelligence and the blockchain, IBM should steadily gain ground. A gradual return to the $140 level – about a 14% increase from the time-of-writing price – should be doable. And even under bearish market conditions, the stoutness of Big Blue’s business profile should spare it extreme volatility.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comA powerhouse in innovations such as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) commands attention as an all-around utilitarian tech platform. Fundamentally, Microsoft dominates the language of business. For instance, regarding the desktop operating system segment, Windows dominates with a 75% market share. Basically, if you’re unfamiliar with the Microsoft way, you’re going to struggle in a professional setting.Financially, the company brings plenty of substance to the table. First, it enjoys a stable balance sheet, with a high Altman Z-Score of 7.27. This reflects a low probability of bankruptcy risk. On the income statement, Microsoft features sales expansion metrics that exceed the median ratings for the software industry. As well, its profitability metrics rank among the best in class.At the moment, MSFT finds itself down over 29% on a year-to-date basis. Frankly, this doesn’t seem to align with wider implications, such as the burgeoning gig economy. Thus, regarding tech stock predictions, MSFT should move toward the $300 level. However, if economic conditions go awry, investors should watch the $200 support line. This demarcation also represents a psychologically significant price point.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAnother tech giant that suffered massively during the year so far, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG, NASDAQ: GOOGL) nevertheless offers an unignorable opportunity. Essentially, the company owns the internet. For example, the latest data for global search engine traffic indicates that Alphabet’s Google commands a market share of 92.4%. Everybody else (including the best that Russia and China have to offer) fights for the scraps.Despite this extraordinary stat, GOOG and GOOGL have both found themselves down at least 30% since the beginning of this year. For contrarians, this discount may seem excessive. According to Gurufocus.com, Alphabet ranks as a modestly undervalued business. Backed by a stable balance sheet, Alphabet enjoys robust strengths in the top and bottom lines. Perhaps most notably, its 29% return on equity (which ranks above 88% of its peers) signifies a high-quality business.With both fundamentals and financials aligned enticingly, GOOG/GOOGL should be able to march steadily toward the $130 level. Of course, if bearish pressures become the dominant force, a drop to $80 wouldn’t be shocking.Cisco Systems (CSCO)the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wallSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comWhile not the most exciting market idea for discussions about tech stock predictions, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) warrants careful attention. A digital communications tech conglomerate, Cisco features many demand channels, perhaps most prominently the 5G rollout. So, call it boring but in this ecosystem, boring is good.In addition, Cisco provides a generally reliable source of passive income for those seeking inflation-related mitigation. Per Dividend.com, the company offers a forward yield of 3.63% with a payout ratio of 43.15%. As well, Cisco features 11 years of consecutive dividend increases, a tally that management would probably like to expand upon.Further, Gurufocus.com rates CSCO as modestly undervalued. Financially, the underlying firm features strengths across the board, though it’s notable for its excellent profitability metrics. Additionally, Cisco features a return on equity of 29%, ranked better than 94% of its peers.In terms of tech stock predictions, I anticipate CSCO to march toward and eventually break the upside technical ceiling of $50. From there, it could drive up to $60. However, if bearishness becomes the order of the day, the next logical support line would be around the $35 level.Meta Platforms (META)META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.Source: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.comLong a winner in the tech space, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) finds itself staring at an unusual color for the company: red, as in garish bloody red. Since the start of 2022, META hemorrhaged nearly 61% of its equity value. Moreover, the hits just keep on coming. In the trailing month, for instance, META slipped 9%.Nevertheless, Meta brings too many relevancies to the table to ignore. While Alphabet may own the internet, Meta owns social media via Facebook. In terms of monthly active users, Facebook now has 2.93 billion people logging on. And unlike other competing platforms, Facebook – while predominantly skewing young – appeals to multiple age cohorts. That’s going to be significant for long-term growth.Therefore, in terms of tech stock predictions, I anticipate a recovery in META – or at least the beginning of one. First things first though: investors will need to see META climb back to $200 before we can discuss higher price objectives.Of course, tech stock predictions don’t always point up. Should macro headwinds continue to weigh on the digital advertising space, META could be in serious trouble. We’re talking possibly to $100 based on present market dynamics.Rover Group (ROVR)A terrier lies on a dog bed with a cone on.Source: ShutterstockOne of the intriguing market ideas tied to the gig economy, Rover Group (NASDAQ:ROVR) connects service providers with service seekers. Unlike other pure-play gig economy stocks, however, Rover’s specialty focuses on pet-related services. We’re talking about dog walking, grooming, boarding, and other important needs.Fundamentally, Rover benefits from America’s love of its furry friends. According to the American Pet Products Association, the pet industry generated total revenue of $123.6 billion. Since at least 2018, total revenue increased consecutively, symbolizing substantial demand. Thus, ROVR could be a great deal for those who aren’t put off by its 62% YTD loss.To be fair, data from Gurufocus.com reveals that Rover could use some shoring up in its financials. Undoubtedly, it presently features a growth-centric profile. Still, it does have notable strengths in its balance sheet, highlighted by a cash-to-debt ratio in the double digits.In terms of tech stock predictions, ROVR could return to $5, especially if the return-to-the-office narrative intensifies. That would imply Fido being suddenly alone, thus requiring outside help. However, if economic forces don’t cooperate, ROVR could lose half its present valuation based on consumer budget cuts.Coinbase (COIN)The Coinbase (COIN stock) logo on a smartphone screen with a BTC token. Crypto winter is setting in.Source: Primakov / Shutterstock.comRegarding tech stock predictions, it’s quite possible that interest in Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) ranks among the most queried. Of course, in 2021, seemingly everybody was clamoring for cryptocurrencies and anything related to the blockchain. Now, in 2022, few want to touch the sector with a 10-foot pole. The extremes in sentiment leave COIN in a precarious position.Per Gurufocus.com, Coinbase’s financials leave much to be desired. True, the company expanded significantly in 2021 relative to prior years. However, that’s also the problem. If cryptos aren’t rocking and rolling, COIN suffers dramatically from a lack of activity. Therefore, it’s a very cyclical, feast-or-famine business.For tech stock predictions against a multi-year backdrop, I’m generally bullish on COIN. However, if we’re talking specifically about 2023, I’m afraid I’m not that optimistic. At best, I believe it will meander between the $60 and $70 range. However, if the economy slips into recession, it’s difficult to place a floor on COIN. If pressed for an answer, an erosion to $40 wouldn’t be unbelievable.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.
