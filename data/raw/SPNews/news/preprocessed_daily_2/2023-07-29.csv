There are also instances when revenue and forward guidance mean more than earnings in determining how Wall Street will react.Take a look at some of the REITs that have surpassed the analysts' estimates:Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. (NYSE:ARE) is a Pasadena, California-based REIT with a portfolio of 850 tenants in 430 properties devoted to life science, agtech and technology companies in what its website calls ""top innovation clusters."" These areas include cities like Boston, New York City, Seattle and San Francisco.On July 24, Alexandria Real Estate released its second-quarter operating results. FFO of $2.24 was higher than FFO of $2.10 in the second quarter of 2022 and beat the estimates by $0.04.  Revenue of $713.9 million beat the estimates of $694.54 million and was 10.9% ahead of revenue of $713.9 million in the second quarter of 2022. Alexandria Real Estate also announced its full-year 2023 guidance for FFO of $2.72-$2.78. Street estimates were for $3.09.Shares are up about 5% this week.Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE:BDN) is a Philadelphia-based REIT that as of March 31 owns, develops, leases and manages 163 diverse mixed-use commercial properties from the Northeast to Texas. It has a total of 23 million square feet of rentable space.On July 25, Brandywine Realty Trust released second-quarter operating results. FFO of $0.29 per share beat the estimates by $0.02 but was down 17.14% from FFO of $0.35 in the second quarter of 2022.  Revenue of $125.88 million missed the estimate of $127.63 million but was a 1.48% increase over revenue of $124.04 million in the second quarter of 2022. Shares have risen over 10% since the report was released.Story continuesEmpire State Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE:ESRT) is a New York City-based diversified REIT that owns and operates a portfolio of office, retail and multifamily properties in the greater New York metro area. Empire State Realty is the owner of the Empire State Building, one of the world's most famous buildings. As of March 31, Empire's portfolio included 8.9 million square feet of office space, 718,000 square feet of retail space, and 721 residential units in three multifamily properties.On July 26, Empire State Realty Trust released its second-quarter operating results. FFO of $0.26 beat the estimates of $0.22 but was 10.34% below FFO of $0.29 in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue of $154.6 million missed the estimates by $9.6 million but was 3.52% above revenue of $149.34 million in the second quarter of 2022.Empire State Realty is a REIT that has not performed well for a long time, but it rose over 5% following the release of earnings. Empire State Investors can take hope that perhaps this is the beginning of an improvement in price performance.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

GM, Unum Group UNM, StoneCo Ltd. STNE and Affiliated Managers Group AMG.5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks to Add to Your PortfolioPrice-to-book ratio or P/B ratio is essentially the ratio of stock price to book value, i.e. how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.In value investing, it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong. There are a number of investment styles for finding great stocks at attractive values.While considering valuation metrics, though price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are the first choices, the P/B ratio is also emerging as a convenient tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.Here's the formula for P/B ratio:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Magna International, General Motors Co., Unum Group,StoneCo Ltd. and Affiliated Managers Group are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.Understanding Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company's balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders' equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company's balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.Story continuesA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock's price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Aurora, Canada, Magna International is a manufacturer and supplier of complete automotive components.

STNE, Unum Group UNM, Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. ABG and Magna International Inc. MGA.4 Low Price-to-Cash Flow Stocks to Buy for Optimum ReturnsInvestment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential. Each ratio helps an investor understand a particular aspect of the company's business.One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis — the lower the number, the better. StoneCo Ltd., Unum Group, Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. and Magna International Inc. all boast a low P/CF ratio.Why P/CF Ratio?You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, an important factor that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company's earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company's liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company's liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.Story continuesHowever, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chances of falling into a value trap.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:StoneCo, a leading provider of financial technology and software solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 55.2% for three-five years.

If you want to skip our primer on the stock market and the economy, then head on over to What Are The Best Stocks To Buy Right Now? Top 5 Stocks. When it comes to the turmoil in the U.S. economy that kicked off with the coronavirus pandemic and was extended due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, July 2023 has been the climaxing month. The start of the month saw investors wait with bated breaths about a crucial jobs report that would have provided the first signal about the Federal Reserve's plans for future interest rate hikes. While the central bank had nearly penciled in a 25 basis point interest rate increase for July, the concern surrounded future decisions, especially for the next meeting in September. The month started off with rather shocking private payrolls report that nearly took the wind out of the rally in the first half of 2023, as the data showed that more than twice the number of jobs were added than analysts were actually expecting.This shock was followed by new jobs data from the Labor Department that actually undershot expectations and provided a breather to analysts and investors. Then, inflation for June also saw a cooling off and led to the annual figure sitting at 3% and ending up being below the Dow Jones consensus estimates of 3.1%. However, more drama was in store for investors as July's final week settled in. This was in the form of two additional data sets that enabled an understanding of how far the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have made it into the economy and whether there is any justification for the Fed to even consider raising rates in September or later.The first data set was the GDP growth report from the Commerce Department. This report, like several others before it, provided a conflicting set of conclusions. On a positive note, it showed that the American economy grew by 2.4% in the second quarter with the growth accelerating from 2% in the first quarter. It added that price indexes also grew at a slower pace, lending credence to the belief that no further hikes might be required since inflation is cooling. The second quarter GDP growth data was met by another data release again from the Commerce Department. This was the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index which is also the Fed's favorite inflation tool. Prior to the release, economists were expecting the core PCE to sit at 4.2% annually and 0.3% over the month, and the data met these estimates. The pure PCE, namely prices that also include food and energy, stood at 3% in June, for the slowest pace in two years, and provided a lot of respite to jittery currency markets in particular as all major currencies gained against the U.S. dollar.Story continuesWhile the pure PCE is the Fed's favorite inflation metric, the central bank also monitors the labor and jobs market through several reports. One of these is the Employment Cost Index from the Labor Department. It revealed that civilian compensation costs in America rose by just 1% in Q2 2023 - for the slowest pace of increase since the second quarter of 2021. Annually, in June 2023, wages grew by 4.6% in June, slowing down from 5% in the first quarter. Combined, this data set shows that wage pressures are slowing down, and opens up hope for this trend to continue in the future to bring down inflation and not tip the economy into a recession.So, what's going on in the stock market now that the clouds finally might be disappearing? Well, the market, as you might know, has been on a tear this year. The NASDAQ 100 index closed Friday after gaining 1.85%, while the NASDAQ Composite, the S&amp;P500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) were up 1.90%, 0.99%, and 0.50%, respectively. This brings the year to date gains of the NASDAQ 100 to an exact 45% - and at a time when many had predicted that American economic output might be on the decline. As to whether this market optimism is warranted, Brent Schutte, the chief investment officer of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management believes that those that have made money on the market are done by now and the recent euphoria comes from folks who missed out on the fireworks during H1 2023.He simply put his sentiment as:Those same people who are probably piling in right now were wrong about their outlook nine months ago and now they’re reversing course. I’m pushing in the opposite direction. The equity market will have some difficult months ahead.So, in a market where most people are confused about what's really going on for months, the true question is which stocks should one buy. Well, we've tried our hand at this today, and some top picks are Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO).What Are The Best Stocks To Buy Right Now?Pixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology To compile our list of the best stocks to buy right now, we took a look at the top twenty most popular stocks with hedge funds during Q1 2023 in Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds.

However, with the liberty to set their wages, nearly 26 states across the U.S. have adjusted the hourly wages to a higher level following inflation in 2023.

9,ee8c9fd2-5765-3a86-85c1-6d6246ea25be,WMT,2023-07-29,Dorian and Oxford Industries have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dorian-oxford-industries-highlighted-zacks-143100515.html,1690554660,STORY,"['OXM', 'JNJ', 'WMT', 'LPG']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – July 28, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Dorian LPG as the Bull of the Day and Oxford Industries OXM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM, Walmart Inc. WMT and Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Dorian is a Zacks Rank #1 (Buy) and it sports a B for Value and a C for Growth. This stock is undervalued compared to its peers and also has a large dividend coming up.  The company ships liquid natural gas and has moved steadily higher over the last few months.  Let's explore more about this company in this Bull of The Day article.DescriptionDorian LPG Ltd., together with its subsidiaries, engages in the transportation of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) through its LPG tankers worldwide. It owns and operates twenty-five very large gas carriers (VLGCs). The company was incorporated in 2013 and is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number.  This tells me right away where the market's expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market.  A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved.  That is what you want to see.For Dorian, I see one beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and two misses over the last calendar year.  That is great to see, but by itself that is not enough to make the company a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Earnings Estimates RevisionsThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher.Over the last 30 days, earning estimates have increased for LPG.There are no quarterly estimates in the Zacks Research System.The full year numbers are certainly more important... and they are moving higher.Story continuesThis year has moved from $3.81 to $4.86.Next year is now at $2.37 move up from $2.35.ValuationThe valuation is great here trading at 5.7x forward estimates with the industry average coming in at 17x. Price to book of 1.3x is also well below the 4.6x industry average. Price to sales is at 2.9x and that again is below the 5x industry average.I see operating margins moving from 34% to 43% so there was a huge move there and that is great to see.This looks like a very mispriced asset that is going to benefit from sector rotation back into energy.Bear of the Day:Oxford Industries is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) has seen earnings estimates slide lower recently despite the fact that it has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. This article will look at why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as it is the Bear of the Day.DescriptionOxford Industries, Inc., an apparel company, designs, sources, markets, and distributes products of lifestyle and other brands worldwide. As of January 29, 2022, it operated 186 brand-specific full-price retail stores; 21 Tommy Bahama food and beverage locations; and 35 Tommy Bahama outlet stores. Oxford Industries, Inc. was founded in 1942 and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number.  This tells me right away where the market's expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market.  A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved.  That is what you want to see.In the case of OXM, I see four straight beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn't make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.The Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.Earnings EstimatesThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower. For OXM I see annual estimates moving lower of late.The current fiscal year consensus number moved lower from $11.79 to $11.05 over the last 60 days.The next year has moved from $12.66 to $11.83 over the last 60 days.Negative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).It should be noted that a lot of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions. That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Additional content:3 Top Blue Chip Stocks to Ride the Dow RallyThe Dow is experiencing a fantastic July, with the blue-chip index extending a winning streak not seen in decades, thanks to upbeat corporate earnings and the possibility of a pause in rate hikes soon.It, thus, makes sense to place bets on solid blue-chip players like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Walmart Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson that can make the most of a Dow rally.Dow Seals Longest Winning Streak in 36 YearsAfter a volatile trading session on Jul 26, the Dow was able to clinch its longest winning streak since Jan 20, 1987, per Dow Jones Market Data. The 30-stock blue-chip index scaled upward by 82.05 points, or 0.23%, to register its 13th consecutive trading session in the green.The Dow's latest milestone is now registered in the history books, and if the blue-chip gauge extends its winning streak for another trading session, it will notch its longest daily winning streak since June 1897, which was one year after the index was created in May 1896.Corporate Profits Are ImprovingThe Dow was able to hold onto its positive momentum as the latest corporate quarterly earnings results were mostly encouraging for the blue-chip stocks.3M Company's shares moved northward after the company reported second-quarter earnings beat. Similarly, The Coca-Cola Company's shares moved up on promising earnings results for the quarter that ended in June and a positive outlook for the rest of 2023.The Boeing Company's shares also soared after the company's free cash flow in the second quarter improved following an uptick in commercial aircraft deliveries.Fed Raises Rates But Could Pause AgainMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve increased its interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point as prices of indispensable commodities remain above the central bank's target of 2%.The Fed has hiked interest rates in 11 of its last 12 meetings, and now the benchmark overnight interest rates are 5.25-5.50%, the highest level in more than 22 years.However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell did indicate that interest rate hikes may be paused shortly, as was done in the June meeting. The Fed remains data-driven, and the central bank may choose to hold rates steady in the September meeting.Market pundits are also betting on a rate hike pause in September. Almost 77.2% of them are expecting the Fed to pause rate hikes in the next meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool.Thus, chances of pausing rate hikes boosted investors' sentiment and helped the Dow scale upward as well.

ParrellThank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2023 results. As we work our way through the leasing season, the business is performing well, with same-store expenses now looking a little bit better than we thought, leading us to lower our guidance for that item last night. As a result of this and lower expected interest expense, we are pleased to again raise our same-store net operating income and normalized funds from operations guidance after raising same-store NOI and NFFO guidance, just 2 months ago based on better expected revenue results. In a moment, Michael Manelis will give you color on revenue drivers across our markets. After Michael's remarks, Bob will address the details of the improvement in our expense and NFFO guidance, as well as our successful pending refinancing activity. The overall theme here is that Equity Residential continues to benefit, like most of the multifamily industry from solid demand, but with the more unique benefit of our mostly coastal portfolio being less exposed to the significant levels of supply just beginning to be delivered in the Sunbelt markets. We also continue to manage expenses well in an inflationary environment, which we expect will allow us to drive more dollars to the bottom line than our competitors over time. In terms of specifics, in the quarter we continued to post strong same-store revenue results driven by good demand across our markets and rapidly improving delinquency in Southern California. As you may recall, we increased the midpoint of our same-store revenue guidance for the year to 5.875% in May, right before the NAREIT conference to reflect these factors. That, in turn, caused an improvement of 100 basis points in our same-store NOI guidance midpoint and a $0.03 per share improvement in NFFO guidance at the midpoint. These continued strong operating results speak to the durable nature of our business in the face of some pretty volatile economic conditions. Despite the layoff headlines, particularly in the tech sector that dominated the news in late 2022 and early 2023, we see substantial demand from our affluent renter demographic. Also in places like Seattle, we are hopeful that the return to office mandates by employers like Amazon will drive incremental demand back into the urban areas of the city as commute times become intolerable for workers who dispersed far outside the city in response to COVID and are now required to be in the office frequently and as quality of life issues in these urban areas improve. And while new supply is certainly pressuring the Sunbelt and Denver markets, as I mentioned before, we are seeing moderate levels of supply in most of our major markets. Even in Washington, D.C., where we are seeing the highest levels of competitive new supply is being absorbed at a good rate, and the market is performing well. Switching over to the transactions market. That market continues to be relatively quiet. We did not sell anything in the second quarter. But we did buy a couple of deals, including a newly developed property in lease-up in Atlanta, that I spoke about on our first quarter call. The other acquisition in the second quarter is a 287-unit property located in suburban Denver, which we purchased for approximately $108 million at an acquisition cap rate of 5%. The transaction market generally remains stuck between buyers who expect lower prices given the huge shift in interest rates and a less accommodative capital markets and sellers who remain wedded to early 2022 values and by and large, have assets that are still operating pretty well, so they feel no great compulsion to sell right now. Our sense is that sales will pick up over the next 6 to 12 months as sellers accept the reality of rates being higher for longer as floating rate loans with expiring caps reset, and as developer capital invested in newly completed development deals becomes impatient. Now a quick note on our capital allocation strategy. As we have discussed with you for the past few years, we continue to have a goal of having a more balanced portfolio between urban and suburban and between coastal and Sunbelt markets. We think such a portfolio will create the highest returns and lowest volatility over time. The recent issues caused by COVID in urban centers and the current issues in the Sunbelt markets due to supply are examples of the opportunities and risks we wish to balance. As opportunities present themselves in the Sunbelt and Denver markets and in select suburban locations of our coastal markets to acquire or develop great assets at fair prices, we will be there to do so. And before I turn it over to Michael, I want to take a moment to celebrate our 30 years as a public company. On August 12, 1993, Equity Residential went public on the New York Stock Exchange. Much has happened in the past 30 years. We grew from about 21,000 units, an initial valuation of $800 million in 1993 to more than 225,000 units across more than 50 markets at the peak, leading to our 80,000 units and a value of more than $26 billion today. On this journey, we acquired a number of other public apartment REITs as well as some very large private portfolios, including Archstone. At the head of this enterprise for all those years was our amazing founder and Chairman, Sam Zell, who we lost in May. Sam's guidance and influence are part of our DNA at Equity Residential, and we will continue to run this company to honor his legacy of delivering superior, long-term value to our shareholders. We thank all of you for your support over the past 30 years and for your kind words regarding Sam's passing. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.Michael L. ManelisThanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review the second quarter 2023 operating performance in our markets. We continue to produce very solid results with same-store revenue growth of 5.5% in the second quarter that are in line with our improved May guidance expectations. Results are driven by a continuing improvement in delinquency along with a continued healthy fundamentals in the business. As with last quarter, East Coast markets continue to outperform West Coast. Our results to date reflect our view that we have previously shared with you that pricing trends will follow a normal, albeit slightly muted seasonal trajectory. Generally, layoff announcements seem to have dissipated and our average resident remains in great financial shape with rent-to-income ratios during the quarter for new residents continuing to hover around 20%. Resident lease breaks and transfer activities to reduce rent, often early indicators of resident economic stress remain below pre-pandemic levels and in line with seasonal expectations. The overall employment picture continues to be healthy. and young adults are choosing the attractive lifestyles available in our markets. Single-family home purchases continue to be an expensive proposition. In fact, less than 8% of our residents gave buy home as the reason for their move out in the second quarter, which is well below the 12% norm for this period. Combine this with the overall favorable competitive new supply position we face in most of our markets, and we are on track for a good year in 2023. As a reminder, a combination of more difficult same-store revenue comparison periods, including the absence of governmental rental relief this year and a reversion to a more normal rent growth pattern will result in more moderate, but still above historical growth in the second half of 2023. As we sit here today in the back half of our primary leasing season, the portfolio is 96% occupied with good demand and resident retention. We expect a continued healthy trajectory for the remainder of the leasing season. Our portfolio-wide occupancy is being depressed by turnover in Southern California, primarily L.A. as we work our way through the delinquency issues. In the longer run, replacing these vacant units with paying residents outweighs the slightly lower short-term occupancy. Now let me spend a few minutes talking about market performance. So let's start with the East Coast. New York was by far the top performer for the second quarter with same-store residential revenue growth of more than 13%. We have very little competitive new supply in the market, and our occupancy sits near 97%. Demand indicators continue to be positive, making this market the expected top performer for the year. Boston produced slightly above 8% same-store revenue growth in the second quarter driven by strong demand across the submarkets with our urban properties outperforming our suburban ones. We continue to hear stories of tough commute times for suburbanites, that are resulting in residents coming back to the city. While new supply in the market is above the 5-year average, the large majority of it is not competitive with our assets and appears to be readily absorbed. Heading down to D.C. This market continues to impress with same-store revenue growth of 6.3% in the second quarter despite a high level of new supply across a number of submarkets. The market just keeps going, absorbing these units at a healthy pace and delivering some of the best revenue growth in the portfolio. As an example, Reverb, our new 312-unit development in Central D.C. which is currently in lease-up is delivering weekly application volumes well above expectations, allowing us to reduce concessions and push rate. Occupancy in the D.C. market is just below 97% and we are optimistic for continued strong performance for the year, but recognize the increased volume of new supply that will be delivered in the rest of this year. Now for the West Coast. Our Southern California markets achieved some of the strongest sequential revenue growth in the quarter, demonstrating the early financial benefits of backfilling long-term delinquent units with paying residents. Unlike the Orange County and San Diego markets, which posted good quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, Los Angeles produced slightly negative quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. This reported number, however, is not indicative of the health of the market but more noise from bad debt due to large rental relief receipts in the second quarter of 2022. When you strip this noise out, same-store quarter-over-quarter revenue growth would have been over 5% positive for L.A. We are still seeing healthy demand in Los Angeles and have not felt any negative impact from the workers' strikes in the entertainment industry. Our direct exposure is not significant but acknowledge it may soften overall market conditions in the coming months, which could slow our ability to release some of our vacant units. In addition to the strike, we continue to see more nonpaying residents move out which is resulting in at least 100 basis point drag to occupancy in the market. We view both of these issues as isolated short-term impacts to the market as the strikes will end and delinquency will gradually resolve itself which, coupled with the long-term demand, we see as catalyst for next year above average market growth in L.A. Moving to San Francisco. The market reported respectable quarter-over-quarter revenue growth of 3.1%, which would have been 4.6% after adjusting for the impact of rental relief receipts in the second quarter of 2022. Overall, the San Francisco market demonstrated leasing velocity in line with normal seasonal trends and met our expectations for the second quarter. The South Bay, which represents 37% of our NOI in the market, continues to be a bright spot. Prospects are telling our local teams that the area meets their hybrid work requirements by keeping them close for in-office days and providing better lifestyle options and more space and access to the natural outdoor amenities. Our recent resident survey tells us that 77% of our residents in the San Francisco Bay Area are either hybrid or fully in office. In downtown San Francisco, we hear from our teams that new residents say that they are leasing to get closer to work. The good news is that the quality of life in downtown San Francisco continues to improve and the local government's focus seems to be showing some signs of promise. While our pricing power in the submarket remains less than desired, and concessions are still being used, downtown has been stable and allowed us to capture demand and regain occupancy to 96% in that submarket. The overall sentiment in the San Francisco market indicates that the tech layoffs are mostly behind us, and there's a lot of momentum around the AI, which keeps us optimistic on the continued recovery in this market. Heading to Seattle, while there is vibrancy in the market with improvements in the quality of life issues, some return to office activity and tourism back to pre-pandemic levels, the market continues to underperform our expectations. While net effective pricing in the overall market is now 2% below the March 2020 levels, there's a wide dispersion among submarkets with the downtown Seattle well below the March 2020 levels primarily due to the continued concession use in the submarket. Overall, Seattle has been a market that has struggled to deliver consistent strong demand over the last couple of years as its tech-heavy workforce has had the flexibility to work from anywhere. For this market to fully recover, it needs to see more consistent strong job growth with better quality of life conditions that will bring people back to the market. The good news is that we are starting to see some positive signs in South Lake Union, which is a tech-heavy neighborhood in the city of Seattle, and this is likely due to the Amazon return to office, which began in May. We are hopeful that this activity will soon spill over to the other downtown submarkets. Finally, in our expansion markets, which currently make up about 5% of our same-store NOI, revenue performance has been mostly in line with our acquisition pro formas and guidance expectations. Our portfolios in Denver, Dallas and Austin continue to be the most impacted by new supply like we discussed last quarter. Meanwhile, Atlanta remains a bright spot with double-digit revenue growth for both the quarter and year-to-date. In a minute, I will turn it over to Bob to discuss our operating expense performance and the balance sheet. But let me take a minute to discuss our operating platform, which is humming as we continue to reap the benefits of our focus on innovation and the technology evolution of Equity. We are focused on the customer experience and the feedback we receive from our customers help us in developing our platform to drive superior financial performance and customer satisfaction. The insights we gained from our resident survey, which garnered more than 32,000 responses validates our strategy of combining our growing data science capabilities with streamlined execution while delivering self-service solutions to our customers. Leveraging data and analytics on top of our resident feedback will create further opportunities to expand our operating margin. With a fully centralized and mobile operating platform, we are in a strong position to create a seamless customer experience with a platform that continues to allow us to innovate, experiment and rapidly scale what works across this portfolio. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob.Robert A. GarechanaThanks, Michael. Let me start with expenses before covering our financing activities. We reported same-store expense growth of 5.5% in the quarter. The main drivers of this growth were repairs and maintenance and on-site payroll. Repairs and maintenance growth in the quarter was driven by continued wage pressure, particularly from contracted services. Payroll growth was mostly due to elevated employee benefit costs during the quarter relative to the same period last year. Without these costs, reported payroll growth would have been 2.6%, which was more in line with our expectations and reflective of the efficiencies we have been achieving from our various operating initiatives. For the full year, same-store expense guidance, we have lowered the midpoint of our range by 25 basis points to 4.25%. This reduction is driven by expectations of continued low real estate tax growth due to modest rate increases and successful appeals activity as well as significantly lower expectations for commodity prices, which are muting utilities expense growth. These more favorable trends will be partially offset by slightly higher payroll and other on-site expenses stemming from the elevated employee benefit costs mentioned from Q2 and administrative costs from the expiration of the eviction moratoriums, respectively. The revised guidance implies a significantly lower rate of growth for expenses during the second half of the year relative to our results through Q2. We think that this is challenging, but definitely achievable given the easier comparable period from the back half of 2022 and the visibility we have into the items I just described. Finally, turning to the capital markets and our 2023 refinancing activities. As we previously discussed, the company has an $800 million secured debt pool that matures in the middle of the fourth quarter. The debt originated from the Archstone transaction back in 2013, currently carries a rate of 4.21% and a portion of it needs to be refinanced in the secured market for tax reasons. During Q2, we began marketing this opportunity to lenders, and I'm happy to report we received significant interest from a variety of capital providers. In July, we selected lenders and entered into 2 loan commitments and locked in slightly below 5.25% rate for the $530 million that we're refinancing. This was approximately 135 basis points over the 10-year treasury at the time and was lower than what we would have expected to do had we been issuing an unsecured bond. As you may recall, we previously also entered into interest rate swaps to hedge this financing, and those were settled for an over $25 million gain. When the gain is amortized over the life of the loan, it results in an economic cost for these financings of 4.7%, which we believe is an excellent outcome, given the environment. Once these loans close, we would expect the company to end the year with approximately 8% floating rate debt, over $2 billion in immediately available liquidity and no real debt maturities outside of commercial paper until June of 2025. This, coupled with the lowest leverage in the company's history position us very well should any opportunities arise. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for question and answers.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Eric Wolfe with Citi.Eric WolfeLooking at your guidance, there's a nice ramp in your earnings in the back half of the year. Just curious if there's anything sort of more onetime or seasonal or nonrecurring on the expense side there? And if I were to sort of just take that at run rate, is that sort of a good run rate to think about going into 2024? Or again, is there something that's sort of elevating it?Robert A. GarechanaEric, it's Bob. So looking at kind of our NFFO for Q3 and Q4, it's -- there's nothing really, in particular, that's a standout on a onetime item. It's really the cumulative growth in NOI that you're seeing in Q3 and then pushing that into Q4 coming from same store. Drilling down a little bit into that, I would say the only thing from a sequential standpoint that is maybe a little bit abnormal is the bad debt component. So we're seeing bad debt improve in the fourth quarter -- and in the third quarter sequentially as we get back to a normalization. So beyond that, there isn't really anything sequentially strange about the -- or onetime in nature about the growth or run rate. As it relates to '24, I think it's a little early to talk about kind of '24, kind of where we are in terms of positioning. But what I would tell you is our numbers are kind of following that typical seasonal pattern that we would have seen and same-store is really driving the operational results.Eric WolfeUnderstood. That's helpful. And then you mentioned L.A. and the writer strike, the actor strike. It doesn't sound like it's really impacting bad debt or rent growth yet, but you said it could impact in a couple of months. Just curious what that's sort of based on and that's already factored into your guidance as well.Michael L. ManelisEric, this is Michael. So I think right now, of course, we're watching to see, is anybody turning keys in, breaking leases, at a pace that's kind of above what you would expect to see. And we really just haven't seen any impact from the strikes and our on-site folks are telling us just the overall direct exposure to it doesn't seem to be significant. I think my comments in the prepared remarks were -- right now, we clearly are running occupancy about 100 basis points below normal for this time of year in that L.A. market. So the ability to lease up some of these units that have been vacant, which were from the delinquent, long-term delinquent residents moving out earlier in the year than what we thought. We just think that if the strike is prolonged and keeps going on, it could just create a little bit of a pause in people's willingness to make decisions, to move into a new place, and that could impact just the overall demand profile in the market. But to date, we're really not seeing anything, and I'm not overly concerned about it. But it is something we just got to be aware of.OperatorWe'll go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street.John Joseph PawlowskiMy first question is on the transaction market. Alex, just curious what range of pricing do you think you could achieve on kind of large urban assets in the central business districts of San Fran and Seattle today, just given the sentiment in these markets is still pretty -- well, maybe it's proven, still pretty down. So just curious what type of bid for those types of assets is today.Alexander BrackenridgeJohn, it's Alex. Yes, there would not be a robust bid today. Larger properties are harder to sell. There's some contrary and money out there, but I don't know if it's willing to make a big bet. So I really don't have an exact number because I just haven't seen a trade. I think most people, if they didn't have to trade, just wouldn't be willing to accept the number. So it's almost theoretical at this point. I think over time, that will change as the markets continue to improve and access to capital becomes more normal. It's just such an abnormally hard time to raise sizable capital that I really think it would be a tough time. It would be -- if it was a distressed sale, it would be a pretty high cap rate and maybe not indicative of what the more -- less distressed owner would be willing to sell at.Mark J. ParrellAnd John, it's Mark. Just to add to that. I mean when you think about what supports apartment values, there's certainly a lot of unallocated private capital. I mean, we've heard numbers up to $800 billion of private capital looking worldwide for real estate exposure. So I think people, chief investment officers, those kind of funds just need to see some stability before they're willing to move. I'm hopeful that towards the end of this year and early next, we'll be talking to you about some better numbers in those markets operationally. And I think that will also encourage capital flows. But I agree with Alex. I think it'd be really hard to peg a cap rate. It's almost like on a per unit per square foot basis kind of conversation at the moment. But I think that's going to shift given the amount of capital on the sidelines. And given our hope that operating results will improve over the next 12 months.John Joseph PawlowskiOkay. That makes sense. I guess, over the coming months or quarters when there is a little bit more price discovery, do you expect cap rates for these types of larger gateway trophy assets to be meaningfully higher than more suburban assets in this kind of post-COVID environment?Alexander BrackenridgeWell, what you run into is what ends up being a really compelling discount to replacement cost. So I think people will start looking at that and realize that getting in at a good basis in one of these good cities is just really compelling. So I just really think that will be a floor and we'll prevent too much of a gap from arising.John Joseph PawlowskiOkay. Final question, Mark. Just longer term, as you see these cities heal from COVID, what -- and not meant to be precise, but rough order of magnitude, what's the right urban versus suburban mix in the EQR portfolio 5 years from now while we're on this call?Mark J. ParrellGreat question. We've sort of thought about, as we see ourselves as sort of 60% or so urban right now. And to get that number below 50% would probably be a goal. I think expanding into the Sunbelt markets, as you know, is a goal, and I think a great opportunity with the amount of product that's coming through. And I think in the suburban markets in some of our current coastal areas is a good idea too. So my guess, John, is you'll see sort of 1/3 of the portfolio in Denver and the Sunbelt markets 5 years from now. And you'll sort of see more of a 50-50 split urban, suburban. But we are a creature of opportunity. And if there was an opportunity to be -- to stay more urban because it was just absolutely compelling prices, as Alex described, John, we'd certainly think hard about that. I mean we're not -- we feel like having a more balanced platform will give us better cash flow growth, more stable cash flow growth over time. But the name of the game is buying right. And if we can buy very well, we might move tactically for a while a different direction.OperatorWe'll go next to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.Stephen Thomas SakwaI was wondering if you could maybe just talk about where you're sending out renewal notices. I know you've provided some July data. But like what is August and September look like? And I guess, where do those discussions look like? And I guess, where are you seeing the most pressure on the new leases?Michael L. ManelisSteve, this is Michael. So for the renewals right now, you're right. We've got -- our quotes are out there for the next 3 months or so. It's been fairly consistent as what we've seen in the last couple of months. And right now, based on conversations we've been seeing through our centralized renewal team, we don't really expect to see a lot of variation. We think we're going to continue to renew about 55% to 60% of our residents and achieve right around a 5% to 5.5% kind of achieved renewal rate growth, which incorporates a little bit more negotiation. And typically, what you see is as you get into the beginning of the peak leasing season, our centralized renewal teams, we tightened up that negotiation range, call it to like 100, 150 basis points up-quote. Now what we expect to see as we get in towards the tail end of the peak leasing season just to kind of drop that off a little bit and probably negotiate about 200 basis points off of the quotes that are out there. But again, I think we remain really optimistic about the performance. Centralizing this team has really given us the ability to kind of pivot quickly and really deliver consistent results. In terms of the new lease pressure right now, I think if you would just look at some of the reported stats and you could see kind of in Seattle and San Francisco, where you're still doing that concessions in those urban centers, that's definitely weighing in on some of our ability to have a new lease change kind of go positive. But again, I think overall, where we sit today in this leasing season, it's playing out kind of exactly like we thought, where rents are sitting, where our new lease changes and the renewal performance and we just see kind of the markets reacting like they normally will through kind of the season, and that's kind of what's baked into the guidance that we have.Stephen Thomas SakwaGreat. And then I guess just on the development front. I know you've got a handful of projects, I think one wholly owned and several joint venture developments. Can you just remind us kind of where those development yields are likely to pencil out and I guess, Mark, how are you thinking about the prospect of any future development? If we're hearing correctly, merchant builders are starting to scale back their development teams and hopefully, over the next 18 months, that development pipeline starts to shrink. But I guess how are you thinking about the future pipeline for EQR?Mark J. ParrellSteve, it's Mark, and Alex may join in a second. I mean we've got -- it's good to have a solid internal team, which we have and good JV relationships with [Toll] and others. And we see all this stuff. But as Alex has said on prior calls, it's just not penciling out. There's not enough of a risk premium in what is a risky endeavor of development. So for us, I think acquisitions seem like a better place to invest capital for the time being. I think what could change there is just some sense that either rents have moved a lot. I doubt costs are going to move down in any material regard. But I think right now, I like the development pipeline being smaller. In terms of the yields we're looking at, it's mid- to high 5s on our existing portfolio. The Laguna Clara deal in California, which is a one mile away from Apple's headquarters deal is a little lower than that. It's an existing asset we're densifying. So there's less risk since we know the area so well. But beyond that, Steve, they're kind of high-5 type of situations and to do a development deal, we need something to get into that close to that 6 range. And I don't know, we may start a deal this year. We may not start anything. We'll see.OperatorWe'll go next to Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.Joshua DennerleinMichael, in your opening remarks, you mentioned operating platform initiatives and I think you mentioned some margin expansion potential there. Any early thoughts on where the margins can ultimately go? And maybe over what kind of time frame you're thinking?Michael L. ManelisJosh, this is Michael. So maybe I'll just hit on overall kind of some of the initiatives and the innovations, and I'll let Bob kind of touch base on the actual margins. So I think what we put out in our May investor presentation, really just kind of highlighted the initiatives that we have keyed up. And this year, specific to 2023, we have about $10 million included in the NOI guidance with about 2/3 of that being on the expense front as we keep working through kind of the innovations of leveraging resources across assets. And right now, we're really focused on kind of teeing up the next round of initiatives and it's really more income-based and probably other income-based items that will really kick into gear in the back half of this year and start delivering kind of results into 2024. Right now, we are literally right on track with our numbers, and we feel really confident about the incremental $10 million for '23 and maybe, Bob, if you just want to hit on the overall margin impact of that.Robert A. GarechanaYes. So from a margin standpoint, that will all be accretive to margin. I guess I would say that in the space, we talk -- we all talk about very different margins. So I'm going to talk about the margin, I guess, that I think is most important, which is the cash flow margin, which we highlighted at the NAREIT conference. So cash flow margin, meaning after CapEx, after expense and all of that. We're already running at a league-leading level as it relates to that cash flow margin. And when you layer in the initiatives that Michael is talking about, and that's inclusive of what you have to spend in order to achieve that ROI in CapEx, et cetera, we think we can get a few percentage points of incremental increase there, and that's what we're striving for.Joshua DennerleinOkay. Appreciate that. And then at the opening remarks on Seattle, it just seems like it's the only legacy market you're facing with supply concerns. How long will it take to kind of work through that supply?Michael L. ManelisYes. So Josh, this is Michael again. So right now in Seattle, we're kind of actually in a low of going up against kind of head-to-head competitive supply. If you look at what's expected to be delivered and completed in '24, I think we're going to see that Seattle number kind of in jump on us, and it is something we're absolutely kind of watching and kind of making sure that those units will be delivered. And when we create our guidance for '24, it's something that we will fold into that market. For us, right now, Seattle, it's just been -- it kind of gets momentum and then it stalls a little bit and then it gets momentum. So we really just haven't felt that consistent kind of strong job growth that's really needed to get us back on track and really get us out of that concessionary environment. But to date, it's not really the new supply that's been impacting us.Mark J. ParrellYes, I just want to make a comment on Seattle. It's obviously, for most of us pretty far away. So people aren't out there quite as much. But there's been an amazing renaissance in the city in terms of access to the waterfront, very similar to the big dig in Boston. I think that's a very positive catalyst for quality of life in the downtown area where we have a lot of assets. I do think there's an election coming up. There's been an improvement in attitude in city government about livability and those issues. That's a positive. But I think Michael is right. I think you're going to see a lot of supply, which, on the one hand, Seattle is a market where actually, the percent of rent to income is lowest with New York for us. So there's an ability to pay more rent and there's a lot of high-paying jobs and a lot of good industry in the Seattle metro area. And as the city gets, we hope more livable as people take advantage of these new waterfront amenities. And I think we feel good about Seattle and its ability to draw people in, again, in scale. And Amazon has just kind of called people back to the office. Our folks on the ground say there is some momentum there in South Lake Union, where Amazon has a lot of office workers. So we'll see where that takes us as well. But you asked a very narrow question. I'm giving you more, but I do have a sense of optimism about Seattle, but we have to navigate some of that supply the next, really in '24 and '25 more than in '23.OperatorWe'll go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.John P. KimYou described the strong backdrop in your markets and potentially some demand catalysts going forward. But if we just wanted to isolate July, it looks like the blended lease growth rates had decelerated versus June. And I'm wondering if you -- has that surprised you at all or potentially -- it seems like it would have peaked now rather than peaking a month ago.Michael L. ManelisYes. John, this is Michael. So I'm going to touch on a few different things here. Let me -- I'm going to start just kind of the rents first, and then I'll address the new lease change relative to July. And I'll tell you just -- we went back and we've looked at like the last 15 years of our data and our pricing trend which is that net effective price for our units. It typically peaks out somewhere in that late August to -- or late July to mid-August period. And really the first week of August is kind of that most common time frame. I'll tell you, we've had really strong foot traffic, strong application volume. So I'm not going to be surprised that if we don't see a few more weeks of slight increases in rates kind of coming through our system. And that being said, I mean, right now, this pricing trend is up about 6% since the beginning of the year, and it's right where we thought it was going to be. So even if we just peaked out at this level right now, it's kind of right in line and we'll be just buying in terms of it flowing through the other stats. In terms of that deceleration of new lease change, I'd start by saying I would not read too much into any single month. As this stat, it's really better to look at over time. And I think the -- what you saw in our release, it was like a 10 basis point difference. That's just a lot of noise from maybe who moved out versus who moved in and where that was being done. And right now, I'll say that the new lease change is being more impacted by that concession use in the urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco. But again, I think as we turn the corner and we start looking at August, I wouldn't be surprised if those [numbers] inch back up a little bit. We're really in this tight band relative to our expectations of both new lease renewals and how that kind of translates into that blended new lease or the blended rate. So I wouldn't read too much into any 1 month stat.John P. KimOkay. On the secured debt that you raised at [4.7], it looks like your unsecured notes with a similar term trades around 50 basis points above that. How does that spread you secured versus unsecured, how is that 50 basis points compared to historical? And if this continues would the secured market look more attractive to you going forward?Robert A. GarechanaYes. So let me break down -- John, it's Bob. Let me break down a couple of pieces. When you're comparing the [4.70] to what I'm guessing you're comparing to where our unsecured are trading today, what you're incorporating in that is the impact of the hedges, right? So in my prepared remarks, I mentioned that when we issue the secure -- we haven't issued it, but when we locked rate on the secured loan, we were at 135 basis points on the treasury at that time, which was, call it 5.25. How you get to 4.70 as you apply the gain that we got because we did some forward starting swaps at really attractive rates, and that reduced it to 4.70 . So what we should compare is really the spread, that 135 basis points that I talked about in my prepared remarks, to where the spread that would be implied at our unsecured and that's a lot more narrow. That's probably 5 to 10 basis points hit or miss between either one. So they're relatively on top of each other. We think maybe we're maybe 5 basis points inside on secured, but that's 1 day's worth of trading activity could flip you and you could be at parity.OperatorWe'll go next to Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.James Colin FeldmanI was hoping you can dig a little deeper into D.C. across the different submarkets. It seems like it held up pretty well, but there's also a decent amount of supply. So kind of what's your outlook for the back half of the year and into '24 in that market?Michael L. ManelisYes. So what's amazing about D.C. and even when you drill in by submarket, you really don't see a huge differential in our performance. And I think part of that is just when we talked about new supply coming into that market, they got such a great transit environment there, that supply really in any one of these submarkets can pull from other areas. So we really haven't seen any deviation of the performance across the submarkets. Now when you look forward to the balance of the year, like it was back half loaded for delivery. So we are aware that we're going to be facing more and more competitive supply. And it is fairly dispersed across some of these submarkets but again, I don't think we're forecasting to have like more pressure in 1 submarket than the other because of that transit environment that could pull from everywhere. The outlook for the balance of the year, it's still good, right? We're producing really strong revenue growth, good absorption of the supply, it may soften up a little bit, but I think we still have this momentum coming in. And I think it's positioned well for '24, even though you got another round of supply coming at you again. It's a market that's been demonstrating resilience and stability.James Colin FeldmanAnd there's been a lot of talk around the government not bringing certain agencies back to the office. Is that something that you -- that's kind of contemplated in the stats you're seeing already? Maybe those aren't really tenants that would be in your buildings? Or do you think that's a potential drag to come?Mark J. ParrellWell, it's Mark and Michael may add to this. I mean through the real estate roundtable there's been a lot of advocacy around that of trying to get federal workers back on the job. I'm hopeful that continues to push. The administration put something out. It wasn't very strong on that topic but we'll continue to push for that. I mean the federal government is such the key employer of course, in the metro, I mean implicitly in our guidance is not much of a change in the current reality on the ground, getting all those folks back in the office would be helpful. And I remind you, there is a difference between the type of employee. If you're in the national security world, you've likely been at the office the whole time. And as that group grows, there need to be closer in and closer into their office will continue to be relatively high. Again, I'm hopeful that we get -- there's been some action in Congress by the way, some bills introduced to get federal workers back in the office. So I'm hopeful that, that's a positive, but it isn't -- it's not inside of our guidance that we expect improvement. It's just a hope we have both, frankly, as taxpayers and as owners of real estate in D.C.James Colin FeldmanOkay. That's very helpful. And then I guess a similar question across submarkets in Seattle, where so far this cycle, we've seen major differences depending on where in the market assets are located or even [b] versus [a]. What are your thoughts there? And what do you think the implications are as these transit matter as much? Or how should we be thinking about your outlook there?Michael L. ManelisI mean for us right now, it's really like Belltown CBD is where you see the pressure, where you see the prices that are still materially off from where they were in March of 2020. The suburbs there feel good, right? It's not like great and robust, but they are healthy. So it's really just a suburban versus urban kind of differential that we see across that Seattle market. And when you think about the supply that's coming, it will impact not only urban, but also the suburban areas as well for next year in that market.OperatorOur next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.Haendel Emmanuel St. JusteWanted to go back to the West Coast markets for a bit. Just curious if you could give us a bit more color on what you're seeing in terms of concessions maybe between San Fran, Seattle, parts of L.A. And then at a high level, what are your blended rate growth expectations for the West Coast versus East Coast markets in the back half of the year?Michael L. ManelisHaendel, this is Michael. So let me just -- I'll start with just the overall kind of concession use in the portfolio. Fairly consistent in the second quarter versus kind of the first quarter. Overall, we're running about 15% of the applications are receiving just about a month. About 80% of all the concessions that are being used are concentrated in the urban centers of both Seattle and San Francisco. In downtown San Francisco, it's about 50% of the applications are receiving about 6 weeks and in downtown Seattle, it's about 1/3 of the applications that are receiving just over a month. In terms of the spreads in the West Coast markets for new lease change, I don't know if I have that, kind of handy. I will tell you that right now, the East Coast markets have been outperforming the West Coast by about 400 basis points. My guess is that spread is going to stay fairly consistent, although you definitely have some movement in L.A. with some of the changes happening with bad debt.Haendel Emmanuel St. JusteThat's helpful. And where is the loss to lease in the portfolio today? And where is it highest and where is it lowest?Michael L. ManelisSure. So right now, the loss to lease is at 3.7% which for this time of the year is actually a little bit stronger than what we have seen historically. And maybe rather than like going by market around loss to lease, I could just kind of cluster them for you and group a few by a range. So like New York and San Diego have the highest loss to lease right now, which has been running about 9%. And then that's followed by like D.C., Orange County, Boston are all very tightly clustered in this like 4.5% to 6% range. And then you go to like the Denver, the San Francisco, Seattle and L.A. Those are all in like the flat to 2% and then I have my expansion markets of Dallas and Austin are the 2 markets right now that are in a gain to lease. I think when you put all of this into the blender, knowing where pricing trend is today, like I said, with that 6% growth from the beginning of the year, sitting with the 3.7 loss to lease, which is above kind of a normal year, it really does put us in a great position not only to finish out the year, but to have a starting point for '24, that's really above a norm.OperatorWe'll go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.Alexander David GoldfarbHappy 30th anniversary. So 2 questions on -- both actually around acquisitions. So Mark, Sam used to talk about trading sardines and eating sardines. As you guys look at your experience in the -- especially in the urban markets, the bigger assets, do you see those assets in EQR going forward? Do you see them more as trading sardines or eating ones?Mark J. ParrellInteresting. I love that analogy out for a historical reference point. I mean these -- some of the markets like New York, if you want a presence in Midtown, the assets, by definition, are mostly large and costly, all right? So it's more of a market than a type decision, I would say. I think it's more likely that you'd see us sell a large asset because we just want to lower our market exposure there, not because we're particularly allergic to a large asset in the market, if it's not performed well or if we have an over concentration in a submarket, you'll see us sell it. So I guess I don't know what to do with that analogy in the sense that larger assets are harder to sell. We generally operate them pretty efficiently. We generally can run capital pretty efficiently to make up for that. But I don't have a sardine-type description for you. It's up to say that I think we'd sell if we don't like the spot, big or small asset.Alexander David GoldfarbI guess what I'm getting at is given the volatility that we've seen in the urban markets, do you think that it's better for EQR going forward to be more nimble and say, look, we have a base of assets that we like more in the suburbs where it's harder to get in, harder to get out, in the cities where you'll go up to a peak where you have record rents and it's easier to sell and then sort of trade around. That's what I'm trying to get at. If the urban markets are more like trading markets, versus long-term markets. So you're always trying to sort of arbitrage exposure.Mark J. ParrellI guess I don't agree with that. I'd start off by saying volatility in all sorts of assets and you're about to see volatility in the Sunbelt markets with these kind of prices. The fact that they're smaller assets just means that the prices just declined. I mean the way to protect against volatility in the market is to be in a position with your balance sheet and your strategy where you're not a compelled seller. So for us, volatility can mean opportunity, right? If prices go down enough, as I mentioned in my remarks in -- even in San Francisco, we'd be a buyer. So I just want to make that clear. For us, volatility is opportunity, not always a negative and the way we protect ourselves is by having a broader platform. So I think with the lesson we learned over the last 10, 15 years is a broader platform, means you can act more quickly in more markets and take advantage of those volatile moments where Austin, Texas trades cheap to long-term value and you're a buyer there or New York trades cheap and you're a buyer there. So I think as you see us balance the platform out, you're going to see us be more even more opportunistic. And I wouldn't shy away from buying a large asset. I think you just got to go with your eyes wide open about those assets being harder to sell. Is there something you'd add, Alex?Alexander BrackenridgeYes, Alex, this is Alex. I would just add that take Manhattan or actually Boston and D.C. really any of our urban markets to reproduce those portfolios will be virtually impossible. I mean Manhattan, I don't know how you'd find 25 really well-located assets in any amount of time. So we've got an unusual opportunity that we're taking advantage of today and you're seeing in Manhattan. It's the best performing market in the country. And you just couldn't decide all of a sudden you wanted to reproduce that.Alexander David GoldfarbOkay. And then the second question is, given it's a competitive market for transactions, we saw one of your peers do 2 large transactions that are basically neutral initially. Are there ways for you guys to enhance your initial yields, be it like buying it in the preferred or the [mezz] positions or junior positions? Or are there other ways that you can enhance your yield so that when you do close on a deal, it's more accretive than often, it seems like in REIT land, a transaction ends up being neutral year 1, and it's not until year 2 or 3 that we start to see the benefits?Mark J. ParrellYes. I'm going to split this up a little bit for the team to answer. I think I want to start by Alex talk about cap rates certainly matters a ton, but we also think a lot about replacement costs. And I'm going to ask Michael or Bob to just talk about platform scaling, margin expansion at EQR, those kinds of things, Alex, that can affect year 2 yields. Alex?Alexander BrackenridgeYes. So this is Alex. What we're really focused is being a very targeted buyer right now. And what we're targeting are opportunities, where as Mark says, there's a discount to replacement cost, but also a limited supply pipeline. So that typically has been out in the suburbs and those kinds of base. So if you're getting a good basis like that, that's the best thing for your investment in the long run rather than some kind of [mezz] piece that might be a little bit of financial engineering, getting it at a good basis is just irreplaceable.Michael L. ManelisYes. And I think from the operator standpoint, I think we have worked really hard over the last couple of years to build a platform that is highly scalable. So when we go into these markets, we're looking really at the ability to kind of leverage staff across properties, put them onto our platform, kind of put them into our pricing system. And it's clearly accretive from an operating margin for us when we're looking at underwriting these deals. Right now, when we look across these markets, any of the acquisitions we're looking at, we're saying even in our existing markets, what benefits do we get by bringing this into that portfolio, whether that's at a submarket level or the market as a whole?Mark J. ParrellYes. And I just think you've asked some great questions, Alex. I mean we're in a really good position where we've got teams in the markets, we can underwrite quickly, we can take over management quickly, but we're not overexposed to the supply. And there's going to be a lot that's going to be sold in the Sunbelt markets. And I think you should think not just about us selling some of these legacy urban assets and affecting, I'll call it, the numerator, but us making the company net bigger likely by using some of our debt capacity that Bob and his team have created so capably over the last few years to go out there and be a net buyer and I think what's more important to the management team and the Board is that per pound replacement cost discount. I think we're looking for the deals to make sense on an initial cap rate basis as well. But I mean the most important thing, most important signal to us historically has been buying at a meaningful discount to replication cost. And in an environment where construction costs are high and they might be flat for a year or so, but they're likely not going to decline in our opinion much, you can get a discount to basis, you got a little moat around your asset. I like everything about that. So I think that's what you'll hear us talk about if we're fortunate to see some assets out there to buy in these expansion markets and in the suburbs of our existing markets.OperatorWe'll go next to Michael Goldsmith with UBS.Michael GoldsmithMy first question is on bad debt. Can you provide some context in terms of what's included or implied that happens to bad debt in the back half of the year in your updated guidance?Robert A. GarechanaYes. So good question, Michael, it's Bob. So in the back half of the year, we will actually finally switch to bad debt, helping with a growth rate by about 30 basis points. And the reason is because we continue to see that sequential improvement of bad debt, and we'll cross over the difficult comparable period that relates to the rental relief payments we had in the prior year. That accretion or that benefit to total revenue growth is likely not going to occur until the fourth quarter because in the third quarter of 2022, you still had elevated rental relief but we think we'll cross over there. We think at least by the end of the year, when you look at the full year basis, we'll end the year around call it, 125, 130 basis points as a percentage of total revenue and bad debt, which is still elevated relative to the historical norm of 50 basis points and leave the opportunity for more contribution to growth as you go into 2024.Michael GoldsmithGot it. And my second question is more of a strategic question. Arguably, you have one of, if not the best positioned portfolios for the market right now, given the strength in coastal, urban areas and then we consistently are being told that you're looking to have a more balanced portfolio between urban and suburban, coastal and Sunbelt. So can you just talk a little bit about like how should investors reconcile kind of the strength of the portfolio now to kind of the overall strategy of diversifying away from what's working right now?Mark J. ParrellYes. Great. Great question, very fair. I think you're going to see the baton kind of path. So I think for a few years, these Sunbelt markets are going to be pretty stressed. And I think a lot of the owners of these assets aren't long-term owners, they're developers with [impatient] capital, expensive development debt. And we can buy those properties again for a good basis as we just discussed and add them to the portfolio. I think our kind of resident is increasingly in some of the Sunbelt markets. But yet the coastal markets have real supply advantages that you're seeing right now. So creating a real balanced portfolio for our investors, I think for the next year or so, they're going to benefit from just better coastal dynamics on the supply and demand side. I think after a while, those things will even out. And I think they have a portfolio that year in and year out outperforms not just in certain periods, but year in and year out. It just requires more balance between urban, suburban and coastal and Sunbelt, and we're really balancing the demand and supply risks and opportunities. We're thinking a lot about regulatory risk. And we're thinking a bunch about resilience. The cost, for example, of insurance in Florida, the cost of casualty, repairs and things like that are getting more significant. So I think as we talk to our investors, and I think this has been well received and the instruction we've received from the Board is to again, try and create this portfolio that's a little more balanced as to opportunities and risks. And I think what our investors will get are hopefully gleaning numbers for the next, I don't know how many quarters, 18 months to 24 months. And then hopefully, at some point, we'll start to see supply abate and these other new markets, and we'll be there to take advantage of that, having purchased at an attractive basis. So in my hopes and dreams, that's how it would play out.OperatorOur last question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.Adam KramerI think you've done a really good job of kind of presenting pricing trends on a kind of a seasonal or sequential basis historically. Thinking about Slide 24 in your most recent deck, for example. Just wondering, thinking about kind of the late summer months and into the fall, maybe just walk us through your assumptions for kind of growth relative to the normal seasonal pattern.Michael L. ManelisAdam, this is Michael. So I think what we've said is we expected this year to follow normal seasonal trends, both on a rent seasonality, a demand seasonality and right now -- and we said it was going to be a little bit muted. We didn't expect rents to peak quite as high as what they would normally peak. Right now, we're doing kind of right where we thought we would be, turning the corner, heading into August. We would expect, just given the application volume and the foot traffic we're seeing that we've got several weeks left of what I would say is the peak leasing season where we'll continue to inch up a little bit of rate and then as you turn the corner and you walk your way in through September, we do expect that rates will start to moderate a little bit. We have so many years of data. We're looking at all of these stats, and we haven't really seen anything that tells us not to expect that normal kind of softening that occurs in the late third quarter and into the fourth quarter, both from the pricing trend standpoint, little bit on the occupancy standpoint. But right now, we feel pretty good because of the Southern California situation that occupancy will continue to improve and be stable for us for the year. So I just think you just got to look through all of those stats and just put yourself into a bell curve and allow both rent seasonality and demand seasonality to kind of tail off in the third -- late third quarter and fourth quarter. That's what we're modeling. We've seen years clearly where we've been able to defy that and hold the line with rate or have good demand kind of going all the way through the fourth quarter. I just don't have any insight right now to say that this is going to be the year that does that.Adam KramerThat's super helpful. I really appreciate that color. And then I guess it's frankly kind of a similar question. But thinking about back earlier in the year, I think you guys put out a kind of 2.5% market rent growth forecast for the full year. Wondering if at this point in the year, kind of knowing what you know, half year results in so far, would you make any kind of changes to that number? Or is that kind of still how you think about for the full year on average, 2.5% market rate growth?Michael L. ManelisSo Adam, this is Michael again. No, I think we're like -- we're running right at it. Like we're right on top of these numbers. I think that market rate growth you layer on top of where our embedded growth was in the beginning of the year, our ability to capture the loss to lease and then you had that intra-period growth. You put all of that stuff into the blender together and it was pointing us to this like 4% blended rate growth for the year. And right now, that's like exactly where we're headed. So I wouldn't change that number or outlook at all.OperatorThis does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mark Parrell. Please go ahead.Mark J. ParrellThanks, Ruth. Thank you all for your time and interest in Equity Residential today. Enjoy the rest of your summer, and we look forward to seeing many of you out on the fall conference circuit.

Mark J. Parrell, Equity Residential’s president and CEO, noted that the supply picture in the coastal markets where EQR mainly operates “remains favorable”, plus “demand is steady”, and “continued progress in mitigating delinquency in Southern California” is observed.The company also updated the guidance due to pending favorable refinancing activity and second-half same-store expense projections lower than what was previously expected.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues were up 5.5% year over year. Our estimate for same-store revenue growth was 5.9%. Same-store expenses flared up 5.5% and consequently, same-store net operating income (NOI) climbed 5.4% year over year.The average rental rate increased 6.4% year over year to $3,017 in the quarter ended June. Meanwhile, the physical occupancy contracted 80 basis points (bps) to 95.9% for the same-store portfolio. Our estimate for the same was 96.2%.Same-store residential revenues were up 5.5% year over year, while expenses increased 5.3%. Consequently, same-store residential NOI expanded 5.6% year over year.The new lease change for its residential same-store properties was up 2.3%, while the renewal rate achieved by EQR was 5.9% for the second quarter. The blended rate for the quarter was 4.3%. The physical occupancy for this portfolio was 95.9%, flat sequentially.In the second quarter, Equity Residential acquired two operating properties.

MAR is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 1, before the opening bell.In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.4% and 6.4%, respectively.Marriott’s earnings topped the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters and remained flat on one occasion, the average surprise being 8%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter bottom line is pegged at $2.19 per share, indicating growth of 21.7% from earnings of $1.80 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.Marriott International, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMarriott International, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMarriott International, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Marriott International, Inc. QuoteFor revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $6.05 billion, suggesting growth of 13.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Let's check out the factors that are likely to have influenced the quarter.Key Factors to NoteRevenuesMarriott’s second-quarter revenues are expected to have increased on a year-over-year basis, courtesy of robust leisure demand, strong global booking trends and easing of travel restrictions throughout Asia Pacific (particularly in Greater China). These factors are likely to have enabled the growth of revenue per available room (RevPAR), especially on a global basis. This reflects the boost in occupancy rates and average daily rate on a year-over-year basis. With global trends improving, the recovery momentum is likely to have continued in the quarter under review.Owing to an increase in RevPAR and higher co-branded credit card fees for the second quarter, Marriott anticipates gross fee revenues to be in the range of $1,205-$1,225 million, up from the previous quarter’s reported value of $1,073 million.For the quarter, our model predicts gross fee revenues to be $1,224.5 million, up 14.1% year over year. We also anticipate owned, leased, and other revenues to increase 16.7% to $424.9 million year over year.The company expects to witness strong year-over-year growth in the international markets, primarily in Asia Pacific, in the second quarter. The travel demand and booking trend recovery momentum in China have majorly added to the anticipation.Geographically, for the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects RevPAR year-over-year growth in worldwide, international, and U.S. &amp; Canada markets to be within the respective ranges of 10-12%, 27-29% and 5-7%.We expect RevPAR in worldwide, international, and U.S. &amp; Canada markets to grow 10.2% to $131.56, 29% to $117.29 and 5% to $138.16, respectively, year over year. We also expect Asia Pacific RevPAR to grow 32.7% to $104.84 year over year.For the second quarter, our model also predicts total number of rooms to increase 3.8% to 1,558,254 units on a year-over-year basis.MarginsAlthough persisting inflation and economic challenges are potential headwinds, Marriott is still likely to witness margin and earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. The improvement in global trends and RevPAR growth are likely to have helped the company to survive the tough economic conditions.For the second quarter, Marriott expects general, administrative, and other expenses to range within $250-$245 million, up from $216 million reported in the prior-year quarter.  Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range within $1,140-$1,165 million, up from $1,019 million in the year-ago quarter.For the quarter, we expect the company’s general, administrative, and other expenses to increase 6.5% to $246 million year over year. Also, adjusted EBITDA is expected to rise 12.8% to $1,149 million year over year.Furthermore, we also expect adjusted EBITDA and operating margins to increase 20 basis points (bps) to 19.3% and 50 bps to 16.6%, respectively, year over year.Story continuesWhat Our Model IndicatesOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Marriott for the quarter to be reported.

Higher pump prices are mostly attributed to steadily increasing oil prices since oil accounts for almost half the cost of a gallon of gas, but this summer’s heat wave blanketing the country has only further boosted pump prices, some experts say. Extreme heat prevents refineries, which convert oil into usable products like gasoline, from running at full capacity. “If refiners in your region have lower or falling utilization rates, you’re more likely to see gas prices rise,” said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis of GasBuddy, a platform that helps people find the cheap gas.Why is gas going back up in 2023?“We are seeing refiners in Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee and some other states struggle to run anywhere near at maximum rates,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service. “Petroleum engineers can tell you that when ambient temperatures get to the 100-degree neighborhood, it is difficult to run at maximum levels.”Nationwide, refinery utilization decreased by 0.9 percentage points from last week to 93.6%, De Haan said. Gasoline production fell to 9.5 million barrels per day, and distillate fuel production dropped to 4.8 million barrels per day last week.West Coast refineries posted the largest drop (2.4%) to 90.9%, followed by the Gulf Coast’s 1.5% decline to 93.3% and the Midwest slid 1.1% to 97.7%, he said. The last two regions – Rocky Mountains and East Coast – each rose.“These percentages show how much of a region’s overall capacity was used to refine oil,” De Haan said. “It’s important to note these percentages because the lower the utilization percentage, the lower output, which has a direct impact on local gasoline prices.”Shell gas station prices are seen on May 30, 2023 in Austin, Texas. Gas prices begin to rise nationally, but remain lower than prices around this time last year.Is the price of oil going to go up?Oil prices, the largest single contributor to gas prices, rose $10 per barrel in July to a three-month high last Tuesday. “Raw crude price increases add 24 cents per gallon to the price of gasoline and other refined products,” Kloza said.Story continuesProduction cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies and sanctions on Iran, Venezuela and Russia shifting global crude supply are all affecting supply and boosting prices, said Natasha Kaneva, J.P. Morgan’s head of global commodities strategy. Exports also cut into our supply at home. “We are exporting about two cargoes of gasoline (mostly from the Gulf Coast) for every cargo we import,” Kloza said. “We are the supplier of choice for Latin America, which has no additional refining capacity coming up this year.” Summer blends boost prices, too: Gas prices are rising for many drivers: Here's where gas is cheapest and most expensiveAre gas stations just gouging?Likely not. Retail gasoline margins are around 27 cents per gallon now, or about one-third of what they were a year ago, Kloza said. “Thanks to higher wages and other costs, most retailers need something above 30 cents per gallon in order to maintain reasonable fuel profits,” he said. “So for now, the beneficiaries of the return of inflation to energy prices are producers of crude, and refiners, but not retailers. They are the messengers blamed for the message.”Will gas prices drop any time soon?In the short-term, prices may depend on refineries. “There is the fear of more refinery downtime along with the major fear of a hurricane probability cone in the Gulf of Mexico,” Kloza said. “If those fears are removed, we will see substantial gasoline price drops, even if crude oil remains above $80 per barrel.”U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was last at $79.67 per barrel and world benchmark Brent was at $83.81. Both are on track for a fifth weekly gain.Medora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

One year ago, consumers saw a national average price of $4.28.In Wisconsin, the average gas price on Friday rose to $3.54 per gallon, up 14 cents in one week and nine cents from one month ago. Yet the average price remains well below the $3.97-per-gallon Wisconsinites paid at the pump one year ago, according to AAA Wisconsin data. US Diesel Sales Price | FRED | St. Louis Fed Patrick De Haan, a senior petroleum analyst for fuel price tracker GasBuddy, said gasoline and diesel prices tend to rise and fall due to an ever-changing combination of factors that include refining capacity, global demand, oil prices and weather.Consumers this week watched prices increase after Exxon Mobil shut down a gasoline refinery unit in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, one of the largest refineries in the U.S.More generally, extremely high temperatures across the South contributed to refinery issues, De Haan said. He noted other factors affecting current and near-future price trends include:Saudi Arabia cut oil production, which pushed the price up to almost $80 per barrel.The United States appears like it could avoid a recession, which will keep demand for fuel high.UPS and the Teamsters agreed to a new union contract, avoiding a strike that would have impacted demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.Late July and early August is peak travel season in the United States, which increases demand for fuel.""This is really the heart of the driving season right now,"" De Haan said.Weather will play key role in August gas pricesIt's important to remember no one can predict the weather, nor gas prices.Story continuesIt becomes much more difficult to do either in August, which is hurricane season in several states key to oil and gasoline production, De Haan said. GasBuddy's 2023 Fuel Outlook forecasted the average national price in August would be between $3.49 and $4.25. The high end of that range marks the price-tracker's highest forecast price in 2023.""August is always the biggest spread on what we expect because of hurricane season,"" De Haan said.

Earlier, longs in the game appeared undecided on whether to take profit and re-enter with new positions on Monday or hold on hold for another week till next Friday’s OPEC meeting where more jawboning on oil prices was expected.“OPEC knows it has a good thing going and it’s unlikely to pass up on the opportunity to use the hailer again to drive home the messaging of the perma cuts by the Saudis,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital. “Oil bulls also know that the cuts mantra will be echoing all of next week and that explains why so few want to take profit in today’s session.”The Saudis have pledged to take an additional million barrels per day off their production for all this month — and possibly forever — if that meant keeping the market above $80 a barrel at any time.That promise is a powerful motivator for oil bulls as Saudi production would theoretically drop by a total of 2.5 million barrels daily from their norm of 9.5 million a day. With cuts pledged by Russia and nine other oil producers participating in the production squeeze by the 13-member OPEC, the market is missing at least 4.0 million barrels per day in daily supply.Despite the widely-bandied about production cut numbers, weekly petroleum inventory data released by the U.S. government show a market getting by each week with more supply than thought — as well as light demand for fuel in what ought to be runaway consumption for the summer.Story continuesAt Friday’s close, WTI for delivery in September settled up 49 cents, or 0.6%, at $80.58 a barrel. The U.S. crude benchmark hit a new three-month high of $80.69 during the session, extending Thursday’s peak. For the week, it rose 4.6% after a cumulative gain of 11.4% over four prior weeks. With just another session left for July, WTI was also up 14% for the month.Brent for October delivery settled up 75 cents, or 0.9%, at $84.99 per barrel. The global crude benchmark finished the week up 4.8%, adding to the prior four-week gain of 9.8%. For July, Brent showed a gain of more than 12%.While there is no immediate threat of a reversal to the oil rally — not with an OPEC meeting round the corner — WTI was slowly headed toward the key resistance of $86, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“Holding above the 5-day EMA of $79.10 is a precondition for continuation of current bullish momentum,” Dixit said, referring to the Exponential Moving Average.He said the next immediate target of oil longs would be the 100-week SMA, or Simple Moving Average, of $85.30 and the monthly Middle Bollinger Band of $86.40“These two levels are likely to act as the resistance zone in mid-term,” he added.Related ArticlesOil up 5th week ahead of OPEC meet; resistance buildingOil posts fifth week of gains on signals of tighter supplyCold War-era atomic bomb site could host largest US solar development]"

(NYSE:OMC) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 12th of October, with investors receiving $0.70 per share. This makes the dividend yield 3.4%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. Check out our latest analysis for Omnicom Group Omnicom Group's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Based on the last payment, Omnicom Group was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 19.9%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 35%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendOmnicom Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.20, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.80. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.8% per annum over that time. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that Omnicom Group has been growing its earnings per share at 7.1% a year over the past five years. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing.Omnicom Group Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Just as an example, we've come across 2 warning signs for Omnicom Group you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit unpleasant. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

The Fed has now increased interest rates for the 11th time since March 2022, making mortgages and other loans expensive.Although inflation has been cooling over the past year, it is still elevated, which could prompt the Fed to go for more interest rate hikes. Understandably, the crisis is far from over, and the possibility of more rate hikes has once again raised concerns that the economy could slip into a recession.The recent rate hike has now taken the benchmark interest rate, the federal funds rate, to the 5.25-5.50% range, to hit its highest point since March 2001. This increase in interest rates has resulted in more expensive borrowing, pushing up the cost of purchasing a new car or house. It has also made credit cards more expensive to carry.The hike came even though inflation showed signs of easing. Inflation eased for the 12th consecutive month in June. The Consumer Price Index rose 3% in June after increasing 4% in May, the lowest level since March 2021.Inflation now stands at 4.8% compared to a 40-year-high of 9.1% last year. However, it is still elevated and much higher than the Fed’s target of 2%.Unfortunately, interest rate increases aren’t good for the economy, which is currently facing the threat of an impending recession. Rate hikes have an effect on consumer spending patterns, raise borrowing costs, and hinder economic growth.However, investors should not panic. Instead, they should focus on investing in stocks that offer risk-adjusted returns like Ingredion Incorporated INGR, Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. CWCO, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. LW, Entergy Corporation ETR and FirstEnergy Corp.

It's also good to see a healthy gain of 24% in the last year.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Salesforce While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the last half decade, Salesforce became profitable. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Salesforce's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Salesforce shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 24% over one year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 10%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Reported EPS is $0.25 EPS, expectations were $0.28.Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. My name is Brent and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PG&amp;E Corporation Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Jonathan Arnold Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Jonathan Arnold: Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for PG&amp;E's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Carolyn Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters. First, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors which could affect our actual financial results are described on the second page of today's second quarter earnings call presentation. Presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures.The slides along with other relevant information can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We would also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30 2023. With that it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO Patti Poppe.Patti Poppe: Thank you, Jonathan. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on what we know is a very busy earnings morning. We continue to make progress here at PG&amp;E and this quarter is no different. Our core earnings per share of $0.23 for the second quarter bring us to $0.52 for the first half of 2023. While our first half earnings are down $0.03 versus 2022 we have not yet recognized the benefit of our general rate case. As a reminder we have a memo account in place which will allow us to book catch-up revenues from the January 1 2023 effective date once we receive a final CPUC decision. We still expect a final decision in the third quarter and we were encouraged that the CPUC affirmed this timing earlier this month.Story continuesAs we shared at our Investor Day in May 86% of our incremental revenue request is for core safety reliability and maintenance work. All areas where there is strong alignment with state policy goals and stakeholder priorities. While the GRC decision will be an important driver halfway through the year we remain on track to plan and laser-focused on delivering our annual guidance which we are reaffirming today. We are also reaffirming earnings growth rates of at least 10% in 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026 along with our commitment to no new equity issuance through 2024. Turning to Slide 4. We've continued to make progress in mitigating physical and financial risk. On the physical front we continue to focus on system resilience by reducing wildfire risk and preparing for the grid of the future.We continue to make progress on the regulatory front as well. For example, in the second quarter the CPUC approved over $1 billion of interim rate relief in our 2022 Wednesday proceeding. This accelerates the time line for recovering our legacy wildfire mitigation spend improves our financial metrics and allows us to deliver on needed safety reliability and customer connections work benefiting both our customers and our investors. On the legal front, at the end of May, we were pleased to settle with the Shasta County District Attorney's Office resolving the criminal charges related to the 2020 Zogg Fire. The settlement includes commitments by PG&amp;E to contribute $45 million to various local organizations as part of our ongoing efforts to make it right and make it safe.Our settlement followed rulings by the Superior Court which upheld our long-standing position that there was no evidence showing PG&amp;E's inspections fell below the required standard of care, nor was there any evidence that the risk related to the tree was visible prior to the fire. The court's ruling from April is available on our Investor Relations website. Turning to financial risk mitigation. Our strategy continues to hinge around the simple affordable model, which delivers consistently improving value for customers and investors. Regarding the Fire Victim Trust, we are encouraged that the trust has now monetized over 85% of its initial holding and at steadily higher values for its beneficiaries. After the 60 million share sale earlier this month, the trust now holds just over 3% of our stock.As of the end of June, determination notices have been issued for 97% of all claims with the trustee having indicated a goal to reach 100% and monetize the remaining shares by year-end. Turning to slide five. We highlight our layers of protection strategy along with our anticipated step-up in risk reduction from 90% to 94%, as we roll out our new and expanded programs under our 2023 Wildfire Mitigation Plan. One example is downed conductor detection technology, which involves installing new hardware in the field, supplementing our enhanced power line safety settings. We filed our WMP with the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety in late March and the OEIS came out with its revision notice towards the end of June. We view this feedback as a constructive part of the WMP process and we embrace the opportunity to drive further alignment with our regulators.OEIS identified eight critical issues and we will file our response by August 7 deadline with the draft decision from OEIS expected at the end of September. The revision notice process will not preclude us from filing our annual safety certificate application by the due date of September 13 with OEIS approval due 90 days later. As a reminder, our existing safety certificate remains in effect pending an OEIS decision on our timely filed new application. Earlier this month, at the Annual Board level safety briefing with the CPUC, our Utility Board Chair, Cheryl Campbell; and our Chief Operating Officer, Sumeet Singh discussed our safety culture, performance and details of our enterprise safety management system. These meetings are an element of our AB 1054 compliance and provide an opportunity to engage with regulators on our improvement strategies.We were encouraged to hear commissioners recognize our significant progress, while acknowledging our challenges including changing climate conditions. It's in moments like this that we step back and reflect on the progress being made. In fact at a recent meeting with all of our top leaders, Mark Quinlan, our SVP of Wildfire and Emergency Operations stood up to address the elephant in the room when he said, I bet you're all watching the weather and thinking back to 2017. Well, let me remind you just how much we've done since then. He went on to remind us all that we have an entirely different readiness posture and physical risk mitigation regime in place. Back in 2017, we were reacting and responding to hazards. The investments we've made since then have enabled a dramatic shift to predicting and preventing.Slide 6 illustrates the mitigations now in place thanks to these important investments in innovation. To name just a few. Since 2017, we have installed over 600 high-definition cameras now with AI capabilities more than 1,400 weather stations and almost 1,400 sectionalizing devices. We've hardened over 1,300 miles of line and undergrounded over 300 more. We've removed 3.3 million trees. We've staffed a hazard awareness warning center 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year and we've hired 130 fire prevention professionals who are on our PG&amp;E team and making us safer every day. We've implemented a host of operational mitigations including enhanced power line safety settings on 44000 miles of line in and adjacent to our high fire risk areas.We've enabled public safety power shutoffs when conditions warrant them and new for 2023 we've deployed partial voltage force out and down conductor detection. Our system has never been safer and yet it will be even safer still tomorrow and every day after that. As we shared with the CPUC during the safety briefing we are making progress and we have more work to do. Safety permeates through everything we do and the presence of controls, including our layers of protection leads to manageable and predictable outcomes. I'm confident that we and our key partners including the state are doing everything we can to cause our stance catastrophic wildfires shall stop. The data tell the story. Through mid-July reportable ignitions in our high fire threat district have decreased 53% from the equivalent date in 2017.Last year, we saw a 68% reduction in ignitions on EPSS-enabled circuits and a 99% reduction in acres burned. The data so far suggests we are on track to see further improvement in 2023. Our hard work over the past five years has dramatically changed our risk exposure and the fundamental safety of our system and we aren't stopping there. Moving to slide 7. We also see profound changes in financial risk mitigation due to the framework put in place by SB 901 and AB 1054. At our Investor Day, you heard Ann Patterson Governor Newsom's Cabinet Secretary talk about how the state Wildfire Fund is working as planned. The AB 1054 construct is designed to give utilities and capital providers the financial assurance they need while deploying the investments required to bring down wildfire risk on the system over time.Let me quickly revisit the key features for those looking for a refresher or who may be newer to our story. For wildfire claims exceeding $1 billion in a calendar year, we have access to the state wildfire fund. This provides $21 billion of claim-paying capacity protecting investors from the risk of a liquidity event. Our annual wildfire mitigation plan is a requirement for receiving our annual safety certificate. So long as we have a valid safety certificate we have access to two additional key features of AB 1054. First, the utility's conduct is presumed to have been prudent upfront when it comes to seeking cost recovery at the CPUC along with the prudency standard modeled on the constructive FERC precedent. Second in the unlikely event of the utility being found to have acted imprudently any resulting obligation to reimburse the wildfire fund would be capped at 20% of electric T&amp;D equity rate base on a three-year rolling basis.This cap is currently around $3 billion for PG&amp;E. This is a much better construct than what was in place prior to SB 901 and AB 1054 and that enables the attraction of the necessary capital to build and operate a safe and climate resilient energy system. Turning to Slide 8. Let's review our regulatory and legislative time line. We've made progress on multiple fronts in the first half of the year including, approval of our wildfire self-insurance settlement, the Zogg Fire litigation settlement and 2022 WMCE Interim Rate release. Looking forward, we have several catalysts on the horizon, starting with a GRC final decision expected in the current quarter; the ongoing legislative session in Sacramento where we have seen constructive engagement on energization, which you've heard us previously refer to as new customer connections, showing the legislature's commitment to California's clean energy transition and then on our 2023 wildfire mitigation plan and safety certification processes.Gas, Flame, EnergyPhoto by Kwon Junho on UnsplashLooking a little further out, at the end of this year, we will file our nuclear operating license extension application for Diablo Canyon with NRC and we remain ready to submit our 10-year undergrounding plan once the OEIS and the CPUC complete their scoping process. On Slide 9, you have our 2023 report card where we're showing on track for each of our 2023 and long-term targets. This includes our plan to underground 350 miles in 2023, double last year's target and our 2024 FFO to debt target of mid-teens. As you can see, we're also projecting on track for our 2% non-fuel O&amp;M reduction target, which brings me to my story of the month. This month's story illustrates how our regional service model together with our performance playbook and lean operating system is helping improve the customer experience while we eliminate waste and cost in our work processes.In the North Coast region field operations teams are improving upon a common sense approach that has worked in a lot of our programs bundling work. What's different now is that the teams are working across various branches of electric gas systems inspections and vegetation management to coordinate many types of work, not just bundling similar work in siloed programs as we've done in the past. Cross-functional work bundling allows crews to do more work under the same planned outage line clearance, reducing the cost of switching and grid operations and improving overall reliability. During Q2, my coworkers planned and executed 12 jobs under just one planned outage near the town of Willits. Rather than impacting 100-plus customers multiple times over the year, we did it all in just one go.That's one outage, one day of traffic lane closures, one batch of notifications and only one visit. This goes to show you what's possible when we put the customer at the center of our operations. So far this year, we estimate savings of $0.5 million and 800-plus hours when we did not have to deenergize our customers. This is just the tip of the iceberg and something we are working actively to scale up across all regions, proving we can deliver an improved customer experience while cutting costs all at the same time. This is all part of the momentum we're building here at PG&amp;E. And with that, I'll turn it over to Carolyn.Carolyn Burke: Thank you, Patti, and good morning everybody. As Patti mentioned, we are on track to deliver our 2023 financial commitments. Today, we are reaffirming EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2023 and 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. We're also reaffirming our commitment to no new equity in 2023 or 2024. This morning, I'll cover three main topics with you: our 2023 results, the simple affordable model and our value proposition. Let's start on Slide 10. We are on track to meet our 2023 EPS guidance of $1.19 to $1.23. Our first half results and drivers of our forecast for the second half of 2023 are presented here. On a year-to-date basis our result is $0.52 per share, including $0.23 in the second quarter.Our first half EPS is on plan. And as Patti mentioned our plan to reduce non-fuel O&amp;M by 2% is also on track. So far this year we've realized $0.04 of favorability from our cost-saving efforts and we've redeployed $0.02 right back into the business. Although our year-to-date result is down $0.03 compared to 2022, a key driver for the second half of 2023 will be a final decision in our GRC. As a reminder the CPUC has approved a standard memo account, which allows us to record catch-up revenues back to January 1st once the final decision is received. This explains the $0.01 of timing as shown here and also why you don't see customer capital investment as a growth driver in our first half results. Finally, we're showing $0.04 of other. This is a combination of many smaller items over the first and second quarters including higher property taxes reflecting our increased customer capital investment.On Slide 11 our capital investment plans have not changed from Investor Day when we provided insight into our 10-year plan. Our 9.5% rate based CAGR reflects the abundant opportunities to invest capital into our system for the benefit of customers. Please recall this is a no big bets approach focused on safety and reliability with growth benefiting both our customers and our investors. Just as our earnings grow with capital growth it's worth repeating that this capital investment growth above depreciation also provides additional cash flow to help internally fund the investment. Moving to slide 12. We continue to see ample opportunities to expand customer investment beyond the $52 billion planned through 2027. We are fortunate to have substantial needs for investment in our electric distribution and transmission systems as well as opportunities to further improve quality and reduce cost.Our simple affordable model is at the heart of our plan. It is how we plan to keep bills affordable for our customers, which takes us to Slide 13. As you've seen we revisit this slide with you each quarter providing proof points on our execution. Patti already provided an update on our O&amp;M cost reduction progress. And now I'm excited to share some recent efficient financing developments. Our minority sale of non-nuclear generating assets or Pacific Gen continues to move through the regulatory process. We launched the marketing for the proposed sale last month. We expect these attractive and differentiated assets to draw strong investor interest as they are fully regulated with a favorable ratemaking framework. And with California's environmental policies in place, we see a very supportive backdrop for growth opportunities.As a reminder the Pac Gen regulatory and sales processes will progress unparallel time lines. Additionally last month we submitted a loan application to the Department of Energy under the Energy Infrastructure reinvestment program. Our application is all about enabling California's clean energy transition. If our application is approved, we would expect to draw down these funds starting in 2024 and through 2026 to align with spending in our GRC cycle. This is another example of how we're pursuing efficient financing to deliver for our customers and our communities at a lower cost. In addition to providing a diversified funding source for our large capital program, lower cost DOE loans could result in hundreds of millions of dollars in interest expense savings for our customers over the life of the loans.This means that our planned rate base growth could come at a lower cost for our customers creating more capacity for investment in customer benefiting infrastructure, definitely a win-win. We plan to submit part two of our application in the coming months in which we will work with the loan program office on the technical and financial evaluation of our application. I'll end here on slide 14 with a reiteration of dividend timing. Specifically, we expect to reach a cumulative $6.2 billion in non-GAAP core earnings since our emergence from Chapter 11 during the third quarter. As we have said before, this timing remains subject to assumptions including the timing of major regulatory decisions. In practice, this means that our Board could have the opportunity to declare a dividend as soon as our third quarter earnings call.We are committed to restoring a dividend and recognize its importance to traditional utility investors. But let me be clear, we plan to recommend to the Board that we start out with a small dividend likely lower than some published estimates. This will allow us to continue prioritizing needed capital investment including safety and physical risk reduction on behalf of our customers. While we would expect to grow our dividend at least in line with earnings per share, our initial bias will be towards premium EPS growth versus higher yield consistent with our capital investment priority. Our physical and financial risks are being mitigated. Our capital investment need and growth forecast benefits customers and investors. Our EPS growth is among the very best as our stock price recovers from a deep discount.And our value proposition is strong and improving every quarter. And with that I'll hand it back to Patti.Patti Poppe: Thank you, Carolyn. Before we take your questions, I wanted to take a quick moment to highlight two other pieces of news from PG&amp;E this week. Yesterday, we issued our annual corporate sustainability report which outlines major strides we've made towards the triple bottom-line of serving people the planet and California's prosperity. Using statistics and stories the report details meaningful action we took last year in service of our home towns throughout Northern and Central California. Second as highlighted here on slide 15 we hosted our inaugural Innovation Summit earlier this week drawing over 2,000 in-person and virtual participants from venture capital, technolog, academic and financial world. Risk mitigation in particular wildfire has rightly been Job one and our main priority.At the same time, our California service area is at the very forefront of the energy transition given our state's bold vision for the future. With this in mind, we created our innovation research and development team to capitalize on breakthrough opportunities drawing on the external innovation ecosystem to inspire bold new ideas for safety and our operations. For example, during the Innovation Summit, we featured a first-of-its-kind version of Schneider's electric distribution energy management system operating on the Microsoft Cloud. On the topic of innovation, I'm also pleased to announce that the XPrize competition featured at our Investor Day has already received interest from 120 individual teams out of 32 different countries. Talk about breakthrough opportunities.The objective of this competition is to be able to pinpoint ignitions from space within 60 seconds or less and autonomously suppress wildfires within 10 minutes. I'm excited to see what these brilliant minds produce. I'll wrap up on Slide 16, by saying we feel good about the progress we are making, mitigating physical and financial risk. We're confident in the protections we have in place for this wildfire season. And we see several catalysts ahead for investors including restoration of our common stock dividend and a final decision in our 2023 GRC. We see the progress and feel the momentum. We hope you do too. With that operator, please open up the line for questions.See also 25 Most Addictive Video Games in the World and 20 Best AI Chrome Extensions for 2023.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market trends, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Up and Coming Stocks To Invest In.The July Rate HikeOn July 26, the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates once again, this time by 25 basis points. The 0.25% hike has brought interest rates up to about 5.25% to 5.50%, which is the highest level of interest rates in over 22 years. The decision to hike rates this month was unanimous at the Fed, and it was also signaled that the public can expect to see even further rate hikes up ahead this year. Considering this hike, the investing community continues to be plagued with inflation-related concerns and what the current interest rate levels will mean for businesses and consumers heading into the second half of the year. For many, the jump to such a high level of interest rates is proving to be a source of market uncertainty and turbulence, while others are holding on to the belief that the Fed will manage to bring inflation down to a maximum rate of 2% in the long run, as has been affirmed in the Federal Open Market Committee statement.In light of this hike, in a CNBC interview on July 26, David Kelly from JPMorgan Asset Management made the following comments on how he views stocks progressing in the market over the next six months and beyond:""I look at valuations a lot and I do worry about the mega-cap stocks that have really led this charge. But overall I think it good be pretty good because the key point is, eventually inflations gonna get back down to where we were in the last decade, it's gonna get back down to 2%. Eventually, the Fed's gonna have to react to a recession and cut rates back down again and so you get back to a slow growth, low inflation environment in which companies are very good at maintaining margins. I mean that's the other message that we've seen from the earnings reports so far this month. You know, there's a problem with revenues, but they're doing a great job at maintaining margins. I think US companies can do well in a cold climate, and I think the stock market is taking comfort from that.""Story continuesNavigating The Market After The HikeAccording to Kelly, it is becoming increasingly important to keep an eye on stock valuations heading into the second half of the year to ensure one does not end up with overpriced stocks in the event of a market correction. For him, the choice sectors to keep an eye on include industrials and financials. Overall though, Kelly's opinion seems to be that even in the event of a recession, US companies can be expected to perform well enough to satisfy their shareholders.Considering the above, it has become abundantly clear that investors today should really consider factors like stock valuations, potential impacts of the recent rate hike, higher prices, and much more when they are making their investments. Another factor that might be worth considering is the performance of companies that are steadily gaining popularity among the younger generations of consumers and investors today. These up-and-coming stocks, such as e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), are now offering products to a new cohort of consumers that are setting them apart from their competitors and increasing consumer engagement. Some may consider them to be some of the best stocks to invest in right now, and many of the names on our list below can be considered to be some of the best growth stocks for the next 10 years even. In light of imminent market uncertainty and recession-related concerns, we have thus compiled the list below to give investors today some more choices that may be beneficial additions to their portfolios. 11 Best Up And Coming Stocks To Invest InSource:unsplashOur MethodologyWe have selected stocks that have recently been gaining popularity among investors for our list below, using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter. They are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number.Best Up And Coming Stocks To Invest In11. Teladoc Health, Inc (NYSE:TDOC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Teladoc Health, Inc (NYSE:TDOC) is a healthcare company based in Purchase, New York. It operates through its Integrated Care and BetterHelp segments. The company is steadily making a name for itself in the healthcare sector with its telehealth services, allowing patients to consult with medical professionals on its videoconferencing platform.On July 26, Sean Dodge at RBC Capital reiterated an Outperform rating on shares of Teladoc Health, Inc (NYSE:TDOC). The analyst also maintains a price target of $35 on the stock.There were 30 hedge funds long Teladoc Health, Inc (NYSE:TDOC) at the end of the first quarter, holding $890.2 million shares in the company.Like e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), Teladoc Health, Inc (NYSE:TDOC) is a stock that has become increasingly popular among individual investors and hedge funds alike this year.10. e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Olivia Tong, an analyst at Raymond James, maintains an Outperform rating on e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) as of July 24. The analyst also raised her price target on the shares from $115 to $125.Based in Oakland, California, e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) is a personal care products company. It offers cosmetic and skin care products under brands such as e.l.f. Cosmetics, Well People, and Keys Soulcare. The company and its products are highly popular among Gen Z consumers and investors today.We saw 30 hedge funds holding stakes in e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) in the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $505.2 million.Driehaus Capital was the largest shareholder in e.l.f. Beauty, Inc.

(NYSE:ELF) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“New positions initiated in Q4 included shorts International Business Machines (IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and E.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF). Shares of value-oriented beauty brand ELF received a meaningful boost from normalizing beauty usage and spending in a post-COVID environment, which we believe has contributed to its premium multiple relative to competitors in the beauty space. As this temporary lift unwinds, we expect elf’s valuation to similarly return to a level better aligned with its product offerings.”9. Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ:CROX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ:CROX) was seen in the portfolios of 31 hedge funds during the first quarter, with a total stake value of $1.1 billion.An Outperform rating was reiterated on shares of Crocs, Inc.

The company's shoes have become rapidly popular among younger individuals, making it a top up-and-coming stock considering Gen Z consumer spending habits.Here's what Artisan Partners had to say about Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ:CROX) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“We began new GardenSM positions in Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ:CROX), Saia and Shift4 Payments during the quarter. Crocs designs, develops, manufactures and distributes casual footwear and accessories for men, women and children. The company invented the molded plastic Clog in 2002 and has turned it into a $3B global revenue base. We believe revenue growth will continue to surprise to the upside driven by expansion opportunities outside the US, demand from new product introductions (including from recently acquired Hey Dude) and a distribution push both within the direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels. Given the company is still small in terms of a global market share (its $4B in revenues puts them at 1% global market share of the footwear industry), we believe there is a long runway for growth and initiated a GardenSM position.”8.

Since that time, it has been a disruptor of the traditional use of wire and bracket braces to straighten teeth and treat malocclusions. While it is leader in the clear aligner category with roughly 85-90% market share, the bigger competition is taking share from wire and brackets and on that measure, it only has 10-15% share of the overall teeth straightening market. Over time, through innovation and vertical integration, the company has evolved to be able to treat over 90% of all cases. Further, it has done a great job deepening relationships with orthodontists and general practitioner dentists over time. All in all, we believe this is a business with a durable competitive advantage, operating in a large, growing and very attractive industry, led by a proven and long-term oriented management team, with a very long runway ahead of it to grow and compound at very attractive rates.”Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Up And Coming Stocks To Invest In.Suggested articles:10 Up And Coming Streaming Companies And Services13 Best New Stocks To Invest InAnalysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 10 StocksDisclosure: None. 11 Best Up And Coming Stocks To Invest In is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Marathon Oil with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Marathon Oil How Fast Is Marathon Oil Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Over the last three years, Marathon Oil has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. To the delight of shareholders, Marathon Oil's EPS soared from US$2.79 to US$4.41, over the last year. That's a impressive gain of 58%.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The good news is that Marathon Oil is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 15.6 percentage points to 44%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Marathon Oil's future profits.Story continuesAre Marathon Oil Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Marathon Oil, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. To be specific, they have US$34m worth of shares. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. While their ownership only accounts for 0.2%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.Does Marathon Oil Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?For growth investors, Marathon Oil's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 3 warning signs for Marathon Oil (1 is significant!) that you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

If you want to skip our primer on the stock market and the economy, then head on over to What Are The Best Stocks To Buy Right Now? Top 5 Stocks. When it comes to the turmoil in the U.S. economy that kicked off with the coronavirus pandemic and was extended due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, July 2023 has been the climaxing month. The start of the month saw investors wait with bated breaths about a crucial jobs report that would have provided the first signal about the Federal Reserve's plans for future interest rate hikes. While the central bank had nearly penciled in a 25 basis point interest rate increase for July, the concern surrounded future decisions, especially for the next meeting in September. The month started off with rather shocking private payrolls report that nearly took the wind out of the rally in the first half of 2023, as the data showed that more than twice the number of jobs were added than analysts were actually expecting.This shock was followed by new jobs data from the Labor Department that actually undershot expectations and provided a breather to analysts and investors. Then, inflation for June also saw a cooling off and led to the annual figure sitting at 3% and ending up being below the Dow Jones consensus estimates of 3.1%. However, more drama was in store for investors as July's final week settled in. This was in the form of two additional data sets that enabled an understanding of how far the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have made it into the economy and whether there is any justification for the Fed to even consider raising rates in September or later.The first data set was the GDP growth report from the Commerce Department. This report, like several others before it, provided a conflicting set of conclusions. On a positive note, it showed that the American economy grew by 2.4% in the second quarter with the growth accelerating from 2% in the first quarter. It added that price indexes also grew at a slower pace, lending credence to the belief that no further hikes might be required since inflation is cooling. The second quarter GDP growth data was met by another data release again from the Commerce Department. This was the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index which is also the Fed's favorite inflation tool. Prior to the release, economists were expecting the core PCE to sit at 4.2% annually and 0.3% over the month, and the data met these estimates. The pure PCE, namely prices that also include food and energy, stood at 3% in June, for the slowest pace in two years, and provided a lot of respite to jittery currency markets in particular as all major currencies gained against the U.S. dollar.Story continuesWhile the pure PCE is the Fed's favorite inflation metric, the central bank also monitors the labor and jobs market through several reports. One of these is the Employment Cost Index from the Labor Department. It revealed that civilian compensation costs in America rose by just 1% in Q2 2023 - for the slowest pace of increase since the second quarter of 2021. Annually, in June 2023, wages grew by 4.6% in June, slowing down from 5% in the first quarter. Combined, this data set shows that wage pressures are slowing down, and opens up hope for this trend to continue in the future to bring down inflation and not tip the economy into a recession.So, what's going on in the stock market now that the clouds finally might be disappearing? Well, the market, as you might know, has been on a tear this year. The NASDAQ 100 index closed Friday after gaining 1.85%, while the NASDAQ Composite, the S&amp;P500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) were up 1.90%, 0.99%, and 0.50%, respectively. This brings the year to date gains of the NASDAQ 100 to an exact 45% - and at a time when many had predicted that American economic output might be on the decline. As to whether this market optimism is warranted, Brent Schutte, the chief investment officer of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management believes that those that have made money on the market are done by now and the recent euphoria comes from folks who missed out on the fireworks during H1 2023.He simply put his sentiment as:Those same people who are probably piling in right now were wrong about their outlook nine months ago and now they’re reversing course. I’m pushing in the opposite direction. The equity market will have some difficult months ahead.So, in a market where most people are confused about what's really going on for months, the true question is which stocks should one buy. Well, we've tried our hand at this today, and some top picks are Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO).What Are The Best Stocks To Buy Right Now?Pixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology To compile our list of the best stocks to buy right now, we took a look at the top twenty most popular stocks with hedge funds during Q1 2023 in Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds.

To skip our detailed analysis on the Islamic world, you can head over directly to 10 Countries with the Highest Muslim Population in the World.Islam is the second largest religion in the world after Christianity, with over 1.8 billion people practicing the religion – which accounts for nearly 24% of the global population. Home to 229 million Muslims, Indonesia is the largest Muslim country in the world in terms of population. Religious dynamics are rapidly changing around us due to fertility rates, youth population among varying religious communities, and conversions. According to the PEW Research Center, Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world. By 2050, the share of Muslims in the world’s population will come close to that of Christians, 10% of Europe will comprise of Muslims, and India will retain its Hindu majority but will surpass Indonesia to have the largest Muslim population in the world for any country.The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) is the second largest intergovernmental organization in the world with 57 member states. 48 of these are Muslim majority countries, while the remaining are home to sizable Muslim minorities. Salaam Gateway, a leading platform tracking economy of the Islamic world, reported in 2017 that economies of OIC countries contribute 8.51% of the world’s GDP. Indonesia is the largest economy in the Muslim world, having a nominal GDP of $1.31 trillion. It is projected to be the fourth largest economy in the world by 2050. You can read more about economic projections for 2050 in our article, 20 Largest Economies in the World by 2050. In terms of GDP per capita, Qatar is the wealthiest Islamic country with an average Qatari earning $114,648 in 2022 according to the World Bank.The share of the Muslim world’s contribution to the global economy is disproportionate to the size of their population, but the Islamic world offers immense potential with a wealth of natural resources. While Iran has the second largest proven natural gas reserves after Russia, estimated at over 1,133 trillion cubic feet, seven of the top ten countries with the largest share of oil reserves are OIC member states. A number of those oil rich countries are in the Middle East and Africa. One of these is Saudi Arabia, which is one of the largest exporters of oil in the world, and a founding member of OPEC. Saudi Aramco is one of the largest companies in the world by revenue, and is part of Fortune’s Global 500. In 2022, it generated $161 billion in profits, which is more than triple of what Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) earned that year. Other prominent exporters of oil include the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Iraq.Story continuesOver the past century, several global corporations from the energy sector have invested in this region. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been operating in Saudi Arabia for the last 90 years and had a key role to play in the original Aramco, or Arabian American Oil Company, which is now Saudi Aramco. British Petroleum, or BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP), has been in the Middle East for over a hundred years now. It was at the forefront of oil discovery in the United Arab Emirates in 1958, and today produces over 170,000 barrels of oil per day in Abu Dhabi. In March this year, BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) jointly offered $2 billion to acquire 50% of Israeli natural gas producer NewMed Energy.South Asian and Southeast Asian muslim countries also offer opportunities to investors to tap into the natural resources as well as the huge markets that exist due to large populations in these countries. In 2018, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) returned to Pakistan after a gap of nearly three decades. It holds a 25% interest in a large offshore block located off the coast of Pakistan with significant exploration potential.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has offices in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Bangladesh. In 2021, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced setting up a datacenter in Indonesia that is projected to raise the company’s annual revenue by over $6 billion. The Malaysian government has also entered into a $1 billion deal with Microsoft Corporation Corporation (NYSE:MSFT), that will involve establishing several data centers in the country between 2021-2026. On the other hand, Samsung has begun manufacturing its top tier smartphone Galaxy S series in Bangladesh, and the Galaxy A series in Pakistan.With that said, let's head over to the list of countries with the largest muslim populations in the world.MethodologyWe have ranked countries with the highest Muslim population in the world using figures released by the World Population Review.

If you want to skip the detailed description of Bruce Berkowitz’s portfolio, check out Top 5 Stocks in Bruce Berkowitz Portfolio.Nearly 28% of all billionaires in the world today are Americans. These individuals are drawn from different professions and industries, but a considerable number made their wealth from investing – Bruce Berkowitz is an apt example. Bruce Robert Berkowitz is a household name in the fund management sphere. Mr. Berkowitz is a Wall Street veteran who began his career in the consulting business. However, the investing career kicked off at the London office of Merryl Lynch in 1983, then, still in London, to Lehman Brothers. He ended employment at Smith Barney Investment Advisers, where he was the managing director, after which he established his own investment firm, Fairholme Capital Management, in 1997.At Fairholme Capital Management, Berkowitz etched his name in the annals of Wall Street history. The firm manages several investment funds; the Fairholme (FAIRX) is the flagship. FAIRX is a non-diversified fund with interests in equity only. Fairholme Capital Management, and by extension, Berkowitz, is widely popular in the industry for the exploits in the noughties (or the twenty-o's) of the 21st century. Between 1999 and 2010, Berkowitz's investment fund returned 343% against the S&amp;P500's 5%.Simply put, investors in the fund earned an average annual return of 14.5% (against the S&amp;P500's 0.5%) in this period. No wonder Morningstar, Inc. declared Berkowitz the Domestic-Stock Fund Manager of the Decade. The then director of mutual fund analysis for Morningstar, Karen Dolan, said of Berkowitz: ""His aptitude for picking stocks sets him apart from his peers, and Fairholme's portfolio is filled with attractively priced firms that generate high free cash flow. Berkowitz's strategy has led to a stellar long-term record, and his large cash stakes have helped limit volatility.""Story continuesBruce Berkowitz Portfolio and Latest TradesBut the twenty-tens were unforgiving to the stock-picking guru so much that many began asking: what happened to Bruce Berkowitz? His performance stagnated after a series of bad investments, which cut the firm's returns to single digit. Luckily, his bounce back did not take too long to happen. In 2020, Bruce Berkowitz Fairholme returned over 50% because a bet in one company went the right way. Since then, the legendary investor has been tinkering with the portfolio, adding, increasing, reducing, and selling off some stocks. However, the fund maintains a significant stake in St Joe Co. (NYSE: JOE), which gobbles up most of Bruce Berkowitz's holdings, 83.08% as of the latest 13F filing. Also, the fund has been doing well for the past three years, which has seen Bruce Berkowitz's net worth increase to $4.3 billion as of June 2023. But what changes has the billionaire investor made lately? What does the new portfolio look like? Read on to find out.MethodologyWe studied Fairholme (FAIRX)'s latest 13F filing for the first quarter of 2023 and noted the trades and the current shareholding. We also looked at how each stock was viewed by 943 hedge funds in our database at the end of the first quarter.Bruce Berkowitz Portfolio and Latest Trades11. Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A)Number of shares as of March 31, 2023: 1 Share of Fairholme portfolio as of March 31, 2023: 0.03% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108Like the Class B shares, Fairholme first bought into Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A) in the sunset months of the Great Recession. Similarly, the fund cut a significant holding of the Class A shares (remained with six shares, down from 1,573) in Q1 2012. But while Berkowitz rebuilt the Class B stake, he held back from increasing the Class A stake beyond three, later exiting in Q1 2016. However, he bought back one share in Q2 2020, which the fund still holds.The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A) fell to 108 in Q1 2023, from 110 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $12.61 billion.10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of shares as of March 31, 2023: 4,260 Share of Fairholme portfolio as of March 31, 2023: 0.05% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the only company in the world valued at more than $3 trillion. That Fairholme acquired AAPL shares before that remarkable achievement speaks volumes about Berkowitz's aptitude for picking winning stocks. The investor initiated a position in Q3 2020 with 4,260 shares, which he later increased to 14,060 in Q2 2021, then cut back to 4,260 in Q1 2022. The stake remains at this level as of Q1 2023.As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, Insider Monkey’s database indicates that 131 hedge funds, tracked by the platform, held stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The combined value of these hedge funds’ stakes amounted to $165.25 billion.In its investor letter for the second quarter of 2023, Wedgewood Partners provided the following commentary regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) contributed to positive performance during the quarter despite declining revenues and operating earnings mostly driven by difficult comparisons in its Mac segment. iPhone sales grew as supply chain bottlenecks seem to be in the rearview mirror, with component prices falling. The Company also highlighted the torrid growth of its App Store ecosystem, which saw over $1.1 trillion in billings on the platform during 2022, more than double the billings in 2019. Apple has tremendous leverage across the mobile economy due to the App Store’s mission-critical relevance to both developers and users. We continue to hold Apple as a top weighting in the portfolio because this asset-light ecosystem drives sustainably high returns on invested capital.…” (Click here to read the full text)9. Magellan Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:MMP)Number of shares as of March 31, 2023: 28,600 Share of Fairholme portfolio as of March 31, 2023: 0.12% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 11Magellan Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:MMP) is a new entrant in the Fairholme portfolio. MMP's introduction makes Fairholme's interest in the energy sector more prominent, indicating Berkowitz's belief that this industry remains a crucial part of the global economy – of the 11 stocks in Fairholme's portfolio, three operate in the energy industry. Fairholme acquired 28,600 MMP shares in Q1 2023. Interestingly, this move came two years after the fund ditched the company in Q4 2020.At the end of Q1 2023, 11 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in Magellan Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:MMP) with a total value of $24.79 million. With over 1.12 million shares, First Eagle Investment Management was Magellan Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:MMP)’s leading stakeholder in Q1.8. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA)Number of shares as of March 31, 2023: 74,000 Share of Fairholme portfolio as of March 31, 2023: 0.21% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) is Fairholme's sole interest in the healthcare market. The company operates pharmacies, distributes pharmaceutical products, and operates retail drugstores in several locations globally. Fairholme initiated a position in the company in Q4 2021 with 21,000 shares, which later bumped to 74,000 in Q3 2022. The fund has maintained this position since then – it did not report any activity in the past three quarters. Interestingly, the Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) share price has maintained a general downtrend in this period.In the first quarter of 2023, 39 hedge funds had stakes worth $678.5 million in Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA). In addition, Candlestick Capital Management held 1.85 million shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) shares making it the company’s most significant stakeholder.7. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of shares as of March 31, 2023: 94,500 Share of Fairholme portfolio as of March 31, 2023: 0.25% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Most investing gurus have their eyes trained on the semiconductor industry because of the market's immense growth potential. Berkowitz spotted the opportunity earlier – he initiated a position in Q2 2021 by purchasing 157,500 shares of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). His fund grew the holding to 588,400 shares three quarters later but trimmed to 277,300 in Q4 2022. In the most recent 13F filing, Fairholme holds 94,500 Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) shares, implying that the fund trimmed about 66% of the holding. Although Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) dominates the server and PC markets, Berkowitz may have concluded that Nvidia and AMD are encroaching on the company's moat, necessitating an evaluation of the investment.Insider Monkey’s Q1 2023 database shows that 68 hedge funds owned stakes in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared with 62 in the previous quarter. With over 1.5 million shares, Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q1.ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“A third approach to return generation is purchasing idiosyncratic businesses that largely control their own destiny. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), which we purchased in the first quarter on the premise that it would develop a leading domestic foundry business, has struggled with execution missteps and product delays. We are maintaining the position to provide ongoing exposure to semiconductors.”6. Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET)Number of shares as of March 31, 2023: 268,700 Share of Fairholme portfolio as of March 31, 2023: 0.27% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) owns and operates oil and gas infrastructure across the United States. The company has been in Fairholme's portfolio since Q3 2020, with the holding peaking at 1.51 million shares in Q4 2021. Fairholme trimmed the shares to 844,200 in Q1 2022, then to 268,700 in Q2 2022, after which it avoided tinkering. This is to say that Fairholme did not register any activity on the ET counter in the past four quarters, including Q1 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 35 hedge funds were bullish on Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET), with collective stakes worth just over $591.3 million, compared to 38 funds in the prior quarter worth $613.4 million. David Abrams’ Abrams Capital Management with 17.83 million shares, is the biggest stakeholder in the company.Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Stocks in Bruce Berkowitz Portfolio.Suggested articles:12 Best Solar Energy and Battery Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Steel Stocks to Invest InDisclosure: None. Bruce Berkowitz Portfolio and Latest Trades is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The positivity came after the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge showcased cooling prices and hit its lowest level in nearly two years.Jay Powell didn’t declare victory over inflation when the Fed raised rates by 0.25% on Wednesday. But he certainly wasn’t hawkish either. Wall Street is growing increasingly confident that the Fed is all but done hiking. On top of that, the earnings picture is holding up very well as we get deeper into the heart of Q2 earnings season.  With this in mind, we dive into three somewhat under-the-radar large-cap stocks that all reported upbeat quarterly results already that investors might want to buy as we head into August.Paychex (PAYX)Paychex is a software company focused on payroll and other HR-centric offerings such as benefit management, insurance, and beyond. Paychex’s growing suite of HR-based software and technology has helped it amass roughly 740k customers across the U.S. and Europe. The firm is not a household name like Salesforce and some other business software companies. Yet Paychex boasts that its software helps pay one out of every 12 private sector employees in the U.S.Paychex has grown its revenue and earnings at steady clips over the last decade, including 14% top-line expansion in its fiscal 2022 and 9% in FY23—period ended on May 31, 2023—to reach $5 billion for the first time. Looking ahead, PAYX’s revenue is projected to pop 7% in FY24 and another 5% in FY25 to reach $5.62 billion. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are expected to climb by 10% in FY24 and 7% higher in its fiscal 2024, which comes on top of 13% EPS growth last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPaychex’s earnings revisions have continued to climb over the last several years and its more recent upbeat EPS trends help it grab a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. The company boosted its dividend payout by 13% earlier this year, with a yield of 2.8% right now. It is worth stressing as well that digital payroll services and more are nearly ubiquitous and never going out of style.Story continuesPaychex stock has climbed 210% in the last decade to top the S&amp;P 500 and its industry, which are both up around 180%. PAYX shares have surged 72% in the past three years, but are down around 1% in the past 12 months vs. the benchmark’s 10% climb. That said, the stock has ripped 16% higher since its Q4 FY23 report on June 29.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite the rebound, Paychex trades 9% below its record highs. Plus, PAYX climbed back above its 50-week moving average in early July and it is now above its 50-day and 200-day, with it prepared to complete the golden cross, where the shorter-dated trendline climbs back above the longer-term trend. Paychex is also trading at a 25% discount to its highs at 26.9X forward earnings and right near its own decade-long median.Textron (TXT)Textron operates in the broader Aerospace – Defense segment with a wide-range of offerings in the field, as well as far more commercial segments. TXT’s various units and brands include Bell, Cessna, Beechcraft, Pipistrel, Arctic Cat, and more. For instance, Arctic Cat is a leader in the snowmobile and the small off-road vehicle space such as ATVs and side-by-sides. Textron’s Cessna unit is a major player in the world of private aviation for business travel and other, mostly non-commercial flight.Textron’s Pipistrel segment is attempting to push the boundaries of electric aircrafts. TXT’s portfolio also includes Bell, which landed a potentially huge contract with the U.S. Army in late 2022. Textron’s next-generation helicopters are set to become the U.S. Army’s new long-range assault aircraft. The contract could be worth up to $80 billion based on multiple reports.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTextron, which currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), on July 27 posted an impressive beat-and-raise quarter. TXT topped our Q2 EPS estimate by 22%, with its adjusted earnings up 32% YoY. The company also boosted its bottom-line outlook to between $5.20 - $5.30 a share vs. our current $5.09 consensus, which would already mark 27% growth. Zacks estimates call for another solid year of bottom-line expansion in FY24 and strong revenue expansion. And expect analysts to raise these outlooks in the coming days and weeks following TXT’s Q2 report.Textron earlier this month said it approved a new stock buyback program. And six of the 11 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys,” next to five “Holds.” TXT stock is up 165% in the last 10 years to blow away its Aerospace – Defense industry’s 29%. This run includes a 121% surge in the last 36 months. TXT stock has, however, chopped around rather heavily over the last two years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTextron is now up 8% YTD, after it soared following its blowout Q2 results and guidance. TXT is attempting to hit new highs and break out of its current range. TXT is now back above its 50-week moving average and it soared above its 200-day. TXT currently trades below its average Zacks price target. Some investors might appreciate that it sits at around $76 per share, while Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman both trade for around $450 per share.Despite its long-term outperformance of the Aerospace – Defense industry, Textron trades at a roughly 40% discount at 14.4X forward 12-month earnings. TXT’s current valuation also represents 9% value vs. its own decade-long median and 32% compared to its own highs.United Rentals (URI) United Rentals is one of the world’s largest equipment rental firms. URI’s portfolio allows its customers, which include construction firms, utility companies, and far beyond, to rent scissor lifts, towable light towers, generators, and nearly everything else under the sun. The firm’s revenue was booming prior to Covid, with sales up between 15% to 21% for three straight years until they slipped in 2020. But URI quickly left its setbacks behind and posted 14% sales growth in FY21 and 20% in 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnited Rentals has been able to lift its prices alongside inflation, while benefiting from its Ahern Rentals acquisition in late 2022. United Rentals carried over its momentum into 2023, and it topped our Q2 earnings and revenue estimates on July 26. URI, which grabs a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now, also boosted its FY23 outlook. CEO Matthew Flannery said in prepared remarks that it remains “encouraged by the momentum we are carrying into the busiest part of our season as well as our customers’ continued optimism.” Current Zacks estimates call for URI’s sales to jump 20% in 2023 and another 4% in 2024. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to surge by 22% and 9%, respectively. And expect these projections to improve as more analysts update their outlooks. United Rentals aims to keep capitalizing on multi-year tailwinds across infrastructure, manufacturing, and energy and power.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchURI has surged 650% in the past 10 years to crush the S&amp;P 500’s 180% and the Zacks construction sector’s 160%. United Rentals is up 37% in the last 12 months, with it hovering around 8% below its all-time highs. The stock found support at its 50-week moving back in May, and its recent run has it trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. And URI is trading at a 40% discount to its own decade-long highs and right at its median of 10.6X forward 12-month earnings.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And Josh, let's start with the first one and that's Roku that's closing the day up shares moving to the upside of 31%, rallying on better than expected earnings results here from the company.And Josh, I think there was lots of questions going into this report about whether or not Roku was going to hold up given all the macro pressures. Questions about the ad market exactly what that is going to do to Roku but again beating the Street's expectations here, and investors seem to be pretty excited about this.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Seana, it really comes down to just a couple of simple numbers here When you look at Roku what they did in the first quarter versus what they did in the second quarter. So first quarter, ad revenue was down 1% year over year, so it was down compared to the year prior.Fast forward to this quarter, the quarter they just reported for, Roku's ad revenue was up 11% year over year. That's just a massive jump, and a jump that I don't think people were fully expecting because, as you said, people have not felt that good about the ad market. There still is questions about the health of the ad market, but it is some positive signs.And one other note that I wanted to highlight there is just getting costs down. Their operation costs down 8% here. It had been up 42% year over year in the prior quarter. So just to be able to manage costs seems like a key thing that investors are focused on here. Again, people still wondering how that macro backdrop is going to affect Roku in the second half of the year, but maybe once those sort of storm clouds clear a little bit, might be better.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah, we know getting costs under control huge focal point here for investors, especially what we're seeing play out within this sector. A couple of other data points here that stuck out to me in this earnings report, active customer accounts that was up 16% on a year-over-year basis at 73.5 million streaming hours, up 21% from a year ago at 21 or 25.1 billion. Average revenue per user, though, that was off nearly 8% on a year-over-year basis, so some cause for concern there at least for Roku.JOSH SCHAFER: And then I want to take a look at the energy giants too, Exxon and Chevron following today. Exxon missing the Street's expectations in Q2 profits with profits declining 56% since last year. Now, Chevron posted a loss earlier this week, a 48% drop in earnings down from a year ago, but it did beat the Street's expectations. The two oil giants losing a combined $15.5 billion in profits since last year, Seana.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Certainly some worrisome trends here for Exxon, and we're seeing that pressure on the stock off just about 1%. The CEO Darren Woods trying to put a positive spin on this call saying that it was nearly twice when it comes to their earnings work right now.Nearly twice what they made in the second quarter of 2018. That doubling of earnings reflects our work in the intervening years to reshape our portfolio of businesses, invest in advanced products, also drive a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness.Lots of focus when it comes to Exxon and their presence within the Permian Basin. They also announced a record production effort in that region. It's on track here for overall growth of about 10% this year, but clearly, they have been under pressure as we've seen.The price of crude under pressure, below 80 bucks a barrel. Certainly, a headwind here for these larger oil giants.JOSH SCHAFER: Right. And I thought it was interesting too. You mentioned Chevron started pointing out some positives in the quarter, so, I mean, the stock wasn't down that much, right? We're not talking about a massive loss here. And I thought-- their CFO had an interesting comment to Reuters also pointing out that if you look at just earnings and profits, they haven't had this good of a quarter. If you took out their second quarter last year, it's their best second quarter since 2011. So really probably maybe they're not that disappointed in the quarter.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and they're up against very, very tough comps when we're comparing it to what we heard from Exxon back in 2022. All right, let's also take a look at Intel ending the day higher. The company's latest earnings results relaying a gain of just over 6%, one of the top performers in the Dow.Intel showing some signs that it did return to profitability after two straight quarters of losses. CEO Pat Gelsinger attributing the boost to a recovery in PC sales. He also said that the AI boom could potentially help drive sales even higher from here. Clearly, Intel has really struggled with the slowing growth or really the slowdown that we've seen across the board when it comes to the PC market.So this report really pointed to the fact that maybe the PC market had bottomed in the second quarter, and we're looking for that recovery to hopefully, at least in Gelsinger's eyes, he was very confident that it's going to pick up some steam here in the second half.JOSH SCHAFER: That's the key word here is bottom, right? That's a lot of times what you're looking for in these different calls depending on what the metric that was falling is people want to find that bottom because then it means things are probably going to go up, right?So Intel highlighting that PC inventory correction has likely ended, and they're going to come into a positive period there. Also I thought it was interesting again talking about OpEx and just savings. They're talking a lot about being able to save over the next couple of years and fixing that cost structure, which is something that people have been very focused on too.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, they've been very focused on. It certainly seems like the Street was encouraged by these results, although some still a bit hesitant. Oppenheimer was out with a note just commenting on these results saying that they are going to remain on the sidelines as the company's turnaround plans play out. So they're encouraged by the results that they did see this latest quarter, but they also want to see what the numbers look like for the current quarter, and then, of course, as we look ahead to the end of the year.All right, well, we are halfway through the second quarter of earnings. Let's check in on some of the biggest winners and losers so far. And Josh, we got to start off with what we've seen play out in the tech sector so far. And two of the names that stuck out to both of us this week was Meta and Snap. And what we heard from these two names was an extremely different story. Where do you want to start with?JOSH SCHAFER: Meta.SEANA SMITH: OK. Go for it. On a positive note. I like it.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, it's Friday. It's Friday, the market's up. Let's talk about positive things first, right? I thought-- I don't know. Meta it really stuck out to me you could really look at these stories in similar vein in terms of ad market, right? When you think about the fact that Meta says the ad market is doing well, Snapchat is still saying the ad market isn't doing well. Well, maybe one company is just better at providing ads to people on their social media, right?But I thought it was interesting too when you think about Meta and what happened with this quarter, to see this stock rally again on earnings and really not because of the metaverse was one thing that really stuck out to me. We're still not talking about the metaverse.SEANA SMITH: Although Zuckerberg in the earnings he talked--JOSH SCHAFER: Oh, he talked about it.SEANA SMITH: --he says he's very, very committed. But yes, you're right.JOSH SCHAFER: Because people are asking about how much they're spending on it, and that's still a long-term concern. But now they're talking about AI, right? AI is what is driving this. I brought with us one quote a call that says it all, Seana. I'll read this from Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg.He said that, ""Investments that we've made over the years in AI, including the billions of dollars we've spent on AI infrastructure are clearly paying off across our ranking and recommendation systems and improving engagement and monetization."" He specifically said later in the call he thinks AI is contributing to about 7% more time spent on these apps. Of course, then you can make more money with ads, right? So AI actually helping a company make money.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly. And that is what investors wanted to hear was questions about how long we would have to wait in order for these companies to start showing how AI is boosting their bottom lines. And to that point, CFO Susan Lee also telling analysts on the earnings call that AI helped advertisers better measure the performance of their ads.And like Zuckerberg was saying they had users spending more time on the platform, advertisers were spending more money on the platform given the fact that they had a better gauge of their performance of their ads. So certainly, AI contributing to Meta's very impressive quarter. When you take a look at that ad revenue of $31.5 billion, that beat the Street's expectations.Now let's compare it to what we heard from Snap because a totally different story there. Weakness in their advertising business. We know they're investing a lot in their AI tools and what they see as the future, which certainly did pressure profitability at least in this quarter.But I think just when you take a step back, the story hasn't really changed. Snap continues to struggle against the larger players within this space. They're going up against Meta. They're going up against Google Alphabet. And they have shown at least over the last several quarters that they're lagging pretty far behind, and they're struggling to even just remotely stay in the race.JOSH SCHAFER: I mean, we're showing it on the screen right now we just were with the earnings. If you're not a profitable company and your revenue is shrinking, your stock is going to react like this when you announce earnings, right? They just need to find a way to reinvigorate revenue growth, and right now they don't have that answer, and that's clearly what's weighing on shares. It's the second straight quarter that they've seen a revenue decline.They don't really have another product outside of snap itself. Maybe the AI chatbot helps it and brings in new customers, but you're sort of just wondering how they build more monetization here, and that path just doesn't look clear right now.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, it doesn't look clear. A bit of good news though, because we don't want to rain all over everyone's parade. There's some things to get excited about when it comes to Snap. More time spent on its spotlight videos. They did have stable daily active user growth. It could signal maybe a recovery ahead. Certainly, some trends that you would want to see in terms of potential future growth, but we'll see what happens there.JOSH SCHAFER: You're more positive than me.SEANA SMITH: I'm more positive. I'm trying to find the silver lining here. All right, let's talk about some of the reads on the consumer that we got this week. Josh, we heard from Royal Caribbean. We heard from Southwest. And like it was with Meta and Snap, two very different stories here.Let's start on the upbeat note when it comes to Royal Caribbean because this was just a blockbuster quarter here for the company. The shares-- as a result, the shares hitting the highest level that we've seen since prepandemic. CEO Jason Liberty coming out saying that the demand right now is just exceptional, and there's no sign of it slowing down anytime soon.JOSH SCHAFER: This is one of the clearest examples, I think, that we have of the overall conversation about the consumer that people want to spend on experiences and continue to spend on services, right? It's really playing out in the cruise lines, in multiple different cruise lines earnings. You take a look at those stocks throughout this year, they're all rallying at pretty much insane levels at this point. It's been very impressive.But that's been the run. That's been the conversation. And it's really just not surprising to see it come out in the earnings. On the other side, Southwest is dealing with a little bit of something different when it comes to demand, right? They have that demand for people to travel. You probably get on a flight before you go on your cruise. But it was interesting what they highlighted about business demand.And so the quote I want to bring up there. The quote from the call that says it all, Seana, from CEO Bob Jordan. He said, ""It's clear that travel patterns postpandemic are not what they were prepandemic. Some of that is leisure, a lot of that is business. I expect business to continue to come back, but I think it's going to trail the restoration of leisure here for a while."" So when does it come back back, I think is the biggest question looming over Southwest.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, that is a huge question. We've talked to a number of analysts. Savi Syth was one of the analysts that we spoke to earlier this week just talking about the rebound that some airlines are seeing from their business travel customers. Southwest obviously lagging behind. That's pressuring the company here. And as a result, their revamping their flight schedules for next year to reflect some of those postpandemic changes that they are seeing from their customers in regards to their travel patterns here.So a huge contrast to what we've heard from so many of their competitors out there in the space. When you take a look at United, American Airlines, clearly, in a better position there than Southwest. All right, Josh, this is fun. You got to come back another time to break it all down.JOSH SCHAFER: There'll be more earnings next week.SEANA SMITH: There always are at least for now.]"

(NYSE:LUV) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript July 27, 2023Southwest Airlines Co. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $1.3, expectations were $1.1.Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Southwest Airlines Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. My name is Anthony, I will be moderating today’s call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today’s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ma’am.Julia Landrum: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter 2023 conference call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then jump into Q&amp;A. On the call with me today, we have our President and CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green; and Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson. A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectation of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. Also, we will reference our non-GAAP results, which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our press release. So, please refer to the disclosures in our press release from this morning and visit our Investor Relations website for more information. With that, Bob, I’ll turn it over to you.Bob Jordan: Thanks Julia, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I am very pleased to report a solid quarter with net income of $693 million, excluding special items, and all-time record quarterly revenue of just over $7 billion. The demand environment, especially for leisure travel, continues to be resilient as we have seen solid bookings throughout the busy summer travel season. Further, we continue to expect $1 billion to $1.5 billion of pre-tax profit contribution in full year 2023 for our strategic initiatives that we outlined at our Investor Day last December. Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect record operating revenue and solid profits in third quarter 2023 and year-over-year margin expansion for full year 2023.Story continuesI especially want to thank our people for doing such a fantastic job. They helped us get a record number of customers and a record number of bags on a record number of flights successfully to their destinations, as we experienced the lowest second quarter flight cancellation rate in the past 10 years. It wasn’t without trials. We had a lot going on in the operation related to weather, and weather has continued to be a challenge here in July. Despite that, our employees have continued to deliver a very solid performance. From our network ops control center to the front line, our people have worked together extremely well to minimize cancellations and produce a very reliable operation, and I’m just so proud of them for getting our customers where they need to go, despite a challenging operational environment.While our cost outlook has increased for the year, the change is primarily driven by updates to our market wage rate accruals for open collective bargaining agreements. And while fluid, we’re making progress. It’s obviously very hard work and I’m just very appreciative of the dedication of everybody involved in the negotiation process. Now, thinking about where we are with the business, since 2018, we have seen very significant swings due to the grounding of the MAX, demand fall off, of course, from COVID, then the stress from the resurgence of demand, disruptions from post-pandemic supply chain issues, challenges with employee staffing, and most recently, uncertainty with our Boeing aircraft deliveries. The challenges we have faced since 2018 have made planning difficult, so smoothing out fluctuations is a must, and the best way to do that is with smooth and predictable capacity growth.We told you back in April that we were reflowing our order book to allow for orderly and measured growth, and we’re still finalizing the details of that with Boeing, but we remain confident that we will get the 70 deliveries in 2023 that are assumed for our published schedules, and we are working to build a 2024 plan that should be much more stable. We currently are planning to be flying the MAX 7 at some point next year, but if not, we’ll take MAX 8 instead just as we are doing now. Where that leaves us for full year 2023 capacity is unchanged for this year at up 14% to 15% year-over-year. As we shared this morning in our release, we are revamping our 2024 flight schedules. While our network is largely restored at this point, it is not optimized, especially for post-pandemic shifts in business travel.Those adjustments to the network will be largely complete by the March 2024 flight schedules, and we expect those efforts and the continued maturation of development markets to generate an incremental $500 million in pre-tax profit in 2024. The changes will also reduce the percentage of system capacity and development by more than half, returning to normal pre-pandemic levels by the end of next year. We already have our schedule published through March 6, 2024, and currently expect first quarter 2024 capacity to be up in the range of 14% to 16% on a year-over-year basis. Now, keep in mind that nearly 90% of that year-over-year growth is carryover from 2023. For the remainder of 2024, we are planning for a sequential deceleration in year-over-year growth in each quarter next year as we work our way back to our long-term goal of mid-single-digit growth year-over-year.We’ve made a lot of progress in the first half of 2023, completing several major milestones. We quickly developed and are on track for our winter operations plan. We have the staffing plan in place to fully utilize our fleet by the end of the third quarter and have the network restored by the end of the year. Again, to be clear, it’s restored but not yet optimized, and Ryan will share more on how we’re going to adjust the network based on post-pandemic travel patterns. But we have a lot of exciting things in the works that we believe are going to contribute to our 2024 financial results and help us deliver another year of margin expansion next year. In closing, our accomplishments in 2023 lay a foundation for us to shift our focus to restoring our industry-leading financial and operational performance, boost our operational resilience, and make advances in our industry-leading customer service through a focus on digital hospitality.I just can’t say this enough, I’m just so proud of our people. They are the heart of Southwest Airlines, and they deliver day in and day out for each other and for our customers. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.Tammy Romo: Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. First, I’d like to extend another thanks to our employees for their commendable efforts this quarter, resulting in solid operational and financial performance, a hard earned improvement from where we began the year. Overall, we had a really solid quarter. Operationally, we had a great completion factor, despite many weather challenges. Financially, bottom line profits were in line with our expectations, despite pressure from market-driven labor accruals. We produced an all-time quarterly operating revenue record. We also generated double-digit operating margins each month during the quarter. All of this was made possible by the drive and hard work of our incredible employees.I just can’t thank them enough. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue trends and operational performance. So, I will jump right to cost, fleet and then balance sheet. Beginning with fuel, our second quarter jet fuel price was $2.60 per gallon, slightly above our previous guidance. Throughout second quarter, crude oil prices stayed within a reasonable range, hovering for the most part around $80 per barrel. We are 49% hedged for third quarter and estimate our third quarter fuel price to be similar to our second quarter fuel price. And that includes an estimated $0.08 of hedging gains. We now estimate our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon range, including $0.09 of hedging gains. This is up a dime from our previous guidance due to higher refining margins.Of course, market oil prices and heating cracks can be volatile, which is why we hedge. We are currently 54% hedged in 2024, and over the last few months, we’ve added meaningfully to our 2025 portfolio and began building our 2026 portfolio. The total fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio for third quarter through 2026 is $373 million. We will continue to see seek cost effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio with a continued goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection each year. Moving to non-fuel cost, our second quarter year-over-year CASM-X increase of 7.5% was towards the unfavorable end of our guidance range due to incremental adjustments to market wage rate accruals for our open labor agreements. We have said this from the beginning, but our labor accruals are based on market, and in this environment market has obviously been dynamic.We are planning and eager to award our work groups with well-deserved compensation increases. Looking ahead, our nominal third quarter cost trends remain fairly consistent with second quarter. We currently estimate our third quarter CASM-X to increase in the 3.5% to 6.5% range year-over-year. This increase is again largely driven by higher labor costs. We are also continuing to incur additional maintenance expense relative to 2022 for our -800 fleet as more engines come due for heavy maintenance, adding further pressure to our second half cost inflation. For our full year 2023, we now estimate CASM-X to decrease in the range of 1% to 2% year-over-year compared with our previous guidance of down 2% to 4%. The estimated 0.5 increase is due primarily to higher labor cost pressures as I’ve already covered.Engineering, Construction, CompanyAlexey Y. Petrov/Shutterstock.comTurning to our fleet, during second quarter, we received a total of 21 aircraft deliveries and retired 11 -700 aircraft, ending the quarter with over 800 aircraft. We are working to reflow our order book with Boeing. However, for this year, we continue to plan for approximately 70 -8 deliveries and 26 -700 retirements, which takes the fleet to 814 aircraft at year-end. Likewise, our CapEx outlook remains unchanged at approximately $3.5 billion, which assumes approximately $2.3 billion in aircraft capital spend. Our 2023 capacity guidance also remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year 2023 capacity to be up approximately 14% to 15% year-over-year, and we have tightened our third quarter capacity guidance to be up approximately 12% year-over-year.As Bob mentioned, we are planning for first quarter 2024 capacity to grow 14% to 16% year-over-year. Now, keep in mind, we are growing 14% to 15% in 2023, and that alone drives nearly 90% of that first quarter year-over-year growth. So, the primary driver of that first quarter year-over-year growth is annualizing the additional capacity we are adding this year. But, our long-term goal remains mid-single-digit year-over-year growth. Lastly, our balance sheet remains pristine and we remain the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. We ended second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $12.2 billion, net of $67 million in debt repayments for the first half of the year. We continue to be in a net cash position and expect a modest $16 million in scheduled debt repayments for the remainder of the year.And currently, 2023 interest income is still expected to more than offset 2023 interest expense. We declared another dividend in second quarter which was paid just a couple of weeks ago. I am proud of what we have accomplished through the first half of the year. That said, we still have work to do to return to industry-leading financial performance, which is our priority as we work on our plans for next year. This includes managing the ongoing inflationary cost pressures, reflowing our order book with Boeing to support orderly, measured and profitable growth, and rebalancing and optimizing our network. We believe these plans, combined with our existing initiatives and the maturation of our development markets will help us expand both margins and return on invested capital in 2024 as compared with this year.Let me close by saying my confidence in our ability to achieve our financial and operational goals is anchored by my belief in the people of Southwest Airlines and their ability to create and inspire success. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan.Ryan Green: Thanks, Tammy. I’ll walk you through our second quarter revenue results, provide context for our third quarter outlook and update you on some of our commercial priorities. And for additional detail on our revenue performance, I’ll point you to this morning’s earnings release. Starting with second quarter, demand continues to be resilient, especially for leisure travel. Overall trends have remained steady with operating revenue for the first half of 2023, consistently well above 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Operating revenue for second quarter was an all-time quarterly record of just over $7 billion. And in fact, we had record operating revenue in every month of the quarter. Second quarter 2023 unit revenue or RASM decreased 8.3% on a year-over-year basis on a capacity increase of 14.1%.And while it’s a year-over-year decline, it’s still our second highest second quarter RASM to date, which points to the tough comp we were up against from last year. And as a reminder, year-over-year RASM was impacted by a 5-point headwind from approximately $300 million of higher-than-normal breakage revenue that was recognized in the second quarter of 2022, resulting from flight credits issued during the pandemic that were set to expire prior to our later policy change to eliminate flight credit expiration dates. Overall, second quarter revenue came in at the favorable end of our expectations as close-in leisure held strong. Second quarter revenue from corporate travel came in largely as expected, as we realized sequential and year-over-year improvement in managed business revenue.And while travelers from some of our largest segments have reduced their frequency of their business trips from pre-pandemic levels, we’re very pleased with the gains we continue to make in the managed business space. Small and medium businesses, government and educations are strong points for us, and we are growing the number of accounts we have under contract. All of this has allowed us to continue to grow our share of the managed business travel. We gained additional passenger market share in the second quarter and exited the quarter seeing more unique travelers flying for business than we saw pre-pandemic. Moving to the third quarter, we’re seeing leisure booking and yield strength continue throughout the summer travel season with July revenue, which is essentially booked, expected to also be a record.Of course, much of the post Labor Day booking curve comes in closer but we’re very encouraged by the response to our June fare sale for off-peak fall travel and what that suggests for continued leisure demand. We had all-time record bookings the week of our fare sale with three booking days that were top 10 all-time records and included our record day for the most bookings ever taken. In fact, we have more passengers booked for third quarter travel at this point in the curve than we did at the same point in time for second quarter. Of course, on a revenue basis, nominal yields are typically weaker sequentially third quarter versus second quarter but the strength in passengers points to the continued demand for Southwest Airlines. We currently expect overall corporate travel to have a modest underlying trend improvement, and we expect to continue our gains in industry market share.Overall, however, we expect corporate travel demand will remain lower than leisure for the foreseeable future, particularly compared with pre-pandemic. So with a higher leisure mix, and as the number of business trips taken per traveler remain down for our most frequent customers, it gives us an opportunity to look at our current network design. Pre-pandemic, those travelers had a skew of short-haul travel with more frequent trips and also more midweek travel, and our current network is designed assuming those travel patterns would return. Moving forward, there is a revenue opportunity to adjust the network to adapt to the new travel patterns we expect to continue to see from our mix of business and leisure customers. Ultimately, this leaves us with third quarter unit revenue expected to be down 3% to 7% year-over-year on capacity up roughly 12% again on a year-over-year basis.The decline in year-over-year unit revenue is driven by capacity growing faster than seasonably typical as we restore the network and normalize the utilization of our fleet as well as tough prior year comparisons from the post-pandemic domestic demand surge. So, while there is still room to optimize our unit revenue efficiency, this guide implies a third quarter record for operating revenue. So again, we are in the process of adjusting our network to support our imperative of industry-leading financial performance. Starting with the January 2024 schedules, we’ve made changes to the composition of the network such that it supports the customer travel behavior changes I just mentioned. We made changes that reflect where our customers are traveling and when they’re traveling, including time of day and day of week, and this optimization will be largely complete in spring of 2024.In addition, we have more than 10% of our markets under development, which will normalize closer to pre-pandemic levels over the next 12 to 18 months. So, as we said in the release and as Bob mentioned earlier, the go-forward revenue opportunity from the network is substantial. And of course, we also expect continued revenue contribution growth from our existing and fully implemented revenue initiatives. Finally, we have always worked hard to consistently deliver the best hospitality and customer service here at Southwest. Our customer service is, of course, legendary, and our customer policies are industry-leading. And we are on track in deploying our onboard product initiatives, including Wi-Fi upgrades, larger overhead bins and in-seat power.We are now focused on widening our customer service advantage through prioritizations of a series of initiatives that will improve our digital hospitality and allow our customers to serve themselves in most cases. We aren’t ready to provide you all the details there, but the initiatives will help us achieve our goal to deliver the best and most efficient hospitality with next-generation tools, airport layouts and more. And now, with that, I’ll turn it to Andrew.Andrew Watterson: Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I’m going to provide some additional details on our operational performance and a brief update on our Winter Operations Preparedness Plan. Well, I’ll just start by commending our employees for their warrior spirits and the solid operational performance they delivered in an operationally challenging quarter. As Bob mentioned, we had record flight activity, record customers and record bag counts. But we were ready. We were staffed up and we were prepared. Our completion factor in the second quarter was really pretty remarkable. We reliably achieved a flight completion factor of more than 99% in the second quarter. It was the highest second quarter performance in the past 10 years.And that is despite the challenging environment. June, in particular, had tough operating conditions. We had issues across the entire system with pretty much continuous weather disruptions. Safety is always our first priority, so we couldn’t avoid some flight delays, but we are really excelled in getting customers to the destinations and with their bags. And when we had weather events, we managed to reset and be right back on track the next morning, which is a sign of good management through the regular operations by our people. Underneath that headline, we saw broad-based improvements in our operating metrics as on-time performance, long delays, early morning originators, turn compliance, flown as booked and trip Net Promoter Score, all showed solid year-over-year improvements.This was against the backdrop of runway closures in Las Vegas and Denver, which are two of our largest operations. Another drag was our block time hit rate, which dropped over 4 points relative to the second quarter last year as our pilots had to take more circuitous routing because of weather. The broad-based improved performance against these headwinds is a testament to solid execution by our people. Looking forward, we’re also really pleased with our progress on the implementation of our Winter Preparedness Plan. Just a reminder, though the plan is detailed on a micro site, which is available on our website. The plan is on track to be fully implemented in fourth quarter 2023 in advance of our winter storm season. I won’t walk you through all the details today since it’s on the micro site.But I will say that everything is going really well, and we are already accepting delivery of new equipment and infrastructure as well as completing software implementations. We are conducting summer school to trade new ramp agents on deicing and train all ramp agents on new equipment. Obviously, the other thing we have going on is labor negotiations, where we continue to work diligently, and we continue to make progress. I do want to thank all the parties of both sides who work hard to negotiate these collective bargain agreements. I’m grateful that we’ve been able to get so many ratified in the last 9 months, but we still have more to do with a couple that have been amenable for a while. We know the negotiations could be emotional as well as complicated, but we are committed to good faith negotiations to get new agreements in place as quickly as possible and to compensate our employees with market wage rates.So, in closing, I’d like to thank all of our employees for their hard work. It’s an honor to be part of this team and to have the opportunity to support them. And with that, I’ll turn it back over to Julia.Julia Landrum: Thank you, Andrew.

The union said the agreement matched terms reached by pilots at Delta Air Lines and United Airlines.The pilots and American thought they had a deal earlier this month, but it was upended when United struck a richer contract, with raises of up to 40% over four years. American CEO Robert Isom promised to match pay at the other carriers.An American spokeswoman called it “a contract we’re proud of, and one our pilots deserve.”The deal is contingent on the outcome of a ratification vote by American's 15,000 pilots in August.Southwest CEO Robert Jordan said his airline has been in regular negotiations with its pilots, but had “nothing new to report.”“There is no threat of an imminent strike or anything like that,” Jordan said. Federal law requires several conditions to be met before airline unions can legally strike, including a finding by mediators that further negotiations would be pointless.]"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Home Depot, Inc., Philip Morris International Inc. and IBM Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Home Depot have lagged rival Lowe's (+4.3% vs. +17.5%) and the broader market (+4.3% vs. +20.1% for the S&amp;P 500 index) in the year-to-date period, reflecting worries about the retailer's exposure to cyclical forces.That said, the company has been witnessing significant benefits from the execution of the ""One Home Depot"" investment plan, which focuses on expanding supply chain facilities, technology investments and enhancement to the digital experience.The interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have helped consistently boost web traffic for the past few quarters. The company remains on track with its strategic investments to build a Pro ecosystem.However, HD posted dismal first-quarter fiscal 2023 performance. Results were impacted by a more broad-based pressure across the business, driven by softened demand versus expectations. A deflation in lumber prices and unfavorable weather have also hurt the results. HD also provided a conservative view for fiscal 2023.(You can read the full research report on Home Depot here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Philip Morris have outperformed the Zacks Tobacco industry over the past year (+7.0% vs. +5.0%). The company has been benefiting from its solid pricing power. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company's performance in the second quarter of 2023 and is likely to remain a driver.A focus on reduced-risk products, especially IQOS, has been working well for the company, which is witnessing a continued product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products. These upsides are likely to boost organic revenues in the full-year 2023.However, Philip Morris has been battling cost-related headwinds. The company expects to make additional growth-oriented investments in 2023, which may impact margins. Also, soft cigarette shipment volumes and volatile currency movements have been concerns. In full-year 2023, cigarette shipment volumes are expected to decline by 1.5-2.5%.(You can read the full research report on Philp Morris here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of IBM have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (+15.7% vs. +12.3%).

IBM is also poised to benefit from the Watsonx platform.However, declining trends in the infrastructure vertical are hurting top-line growth. Intense competition from other established players in cloud services is putting pressure on margins.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Manulife Financial Corp MFC, Carnival Corp. CCL, Caterpillar CAT, PPG Industries Inc. PPG and Lifetime Brands LCUT.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Stocks Likely to Benefit as Fed Lifts Interest Rates to 22-Year HighThe Federal Reserve, as widely expected, raised interest rates by a quarter-percentage point and signaled the possibility of further increases ahead. This marks the 11th rate increase in more than a year, a streak that has made mortgages and other consumer and business loans increasingly expensive.The rate hike brings the benchmark interest rate, the federal funds rate, to 5.25-5.50%, the highest level since March 2001. The increase in interest rates has made borrowing expensive, pushed up the cost of buying a new car or house, increased the cost of carrying credit card debt and slowed down economic growth.""Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace,"" the Fed said in its statement. ""Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated."" Inflation in the United States cooled down for the 12th consecutive month in June, with the Consumer Price Index rising 3% year over year — the lowest rate since early 2021. Although inflation has dropped from a peak of 9.1%, it has a long way to go to meet the Federal Reserve's 2% target.Sectors to BenefitHigher interest rates usually indicate a healthy economy, which leads to increased consumer confidence, rising wages and higher spending. This combination of factors will result in increased industrial activity and a pickup in consumer demand, thereby lifting value stocks.Story continuesAs such, it will benefit cyclical sectors like financials, industrials and consumer discretionary. A rising interest rate scenario is highly profitable for the financial sector as the steepening yield curve would bolster profits for banks, insurance companies, discount brokerage firms and asset managers.Industrial sectors tend to benefit as a stronger economy can lead to increased business investment, infrastructure spending and demand for durable goods. These industries tend to perform well during periods of economic expansion. While rising interest rates can have negative implications for consumer spending, certain segments within the consumer discretionary sector can benefit. Companies that offer luxury goods and services, such as high-end retailers, luxury automobile manufacturers, and leisure and entertainment providers, may experience increased demand as the economy strengthens and consumer confidence remains intact.The materials sector, which includes companies involved in mining, chemicals, and forestry, can also benefit from a stronger economy driven by higher interest rates. As demand for goods and construction materials rises, companies in this sector may experience increased sales and potentially higher profitability.Further, a healthy economy also leads to increased consumer confidence, rising wages and higher spending. This combination of factors will result in increased industrial activity and a pickup in consumer demand, thereby lifting value stocks.Stocks to Bet OnAmid such a backdrop, we have highlighted stocks from these sectors poised to benefit from a rate hike decision. These include Manulife Financial Corp, Carnival Corp., Caterpillar, PPG Industries Inc. and Lifetime Brands.

The top line was impacted by lower sales in the Titanium Technologies segment and the advanced materials portfolio of the Advanced Performance Materials division. Favorable pricing was offset by lower volumes in the quarter.Adjusted EBITDA declined 32% year over year to $324 million in the quarter, mainly due to weaker results in Titanium Technologies. The Chemours Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Chemours Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Chemours Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Chemours Company Quote Segment HighlightsThe Titanium Technologies division logged revenues of $707 million in the quarter, down 27% year over year. It fell short of our estimate of $784.1 million. Prices in this segment were flat while volumes fell 27%. Volumes were hurt by weaker demand in all regions. Prices were flat as contractual price increases were offset by lower pricing in global flex and distribution channels.Revenues in the Thermal &amp; Specialized Solutions segment ticked up 1% year over year to $523 million in the reported quarter. Volumes fell 1% as higher demand of Opteon refrigerants was offset by reduced demand for legacy refrigerants.

It was below our estimate of $457.1 million. Higher sales in the performance solutions portfolio were offset by reduced sales in the advanced materials business. Price increase of 7% was offset by a volume decline of 9% and a 1% currency headwind. Volumes fell as a result of weaker demand in advanced materials and reduced demand in non-strategic end-markets.Story continuesFinancialsChemours ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $738 million, down around 41% year over year. Long-term debt was $3,604 million, down roughly 1% year over year.Cash provided by operating activities was $61 million in the reported quarter against cash provided of $291 million in the prior-year quarter.

The figure was lower than our estimate of $682.3 million.Fibers segment sales increased 33.5% year over year to $323 million, fueled by significantly higher selling prices for acetate tow due to increased industry capacity utilization and higher raw material, energy and distribution costs.Story continuesFinancialsEastman Chemical ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $410 million, a roughly 10.1% year-over-year decline. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $5,027 million.Operating cash flow was $410 million, up from $245 million in the second quarter of 2022.

It had been in dispute with the previous owners, the Barclay family, over debts of more than £1bn secured against The Telegraph and The Spectator magazine, which was part of the same group of companies.Goldman will act as lead financial adviser on auctions of The Telegraph and The Spectator, alongside legal advisers from the Magic Circle firm Linklaters, it was announced on Friday. Their appointments were made by the boards of the two parent companies, both of which are chaired by the City veteran Mike McTighe.Lloyds chief executive Charlie Nunn said this week that he was in no rush to sell the titles because both are in robust financial health. However, preparations for the auctions are underway and bidding is expected to begin in September.Despite Mr Nunn’s unhurried posture, senior politicians have publicly warned that the new ownership must be secured as soon as possible. Some have expressed private concerns about a bank owning a Conservatives-supporting publication in the run up to a General Election and the risk of a perception of conflicts of interest.Goldman was appointed ahead of four other investment banks which pitched for the work. Experience in the rigorous running of high-profile sales, knowledge of the media sector and understanding of the potential regulatory and political pitfalls were all factors in the decision. Goldman is known for its political connections, not least in counting the Prime Minister as a former employee.Last time The Telegraph was sold the auction was run by Lazard, which this time has a role advising Lloyds. Its long-standing relationship with DMGT, the owner of The Daily Mail and a potential bidder, is believed to have disqualified it from more direct involvement.The sale of an influential news organisation can hit special regulatory hurdles including tests of whether the new proprietor might be counter to the public interests in media plurality, accurate news and free expression. The risk such rules might pose to some potential bids for The Telegraph is likely to play a significant role in how they are judged, alongside the sum offered.Story continuesEstimates for the value of The Telegraph have varied from as low as £400m to as high as £1bn. The uncertainty is partly caused by the facts that major news organisations very rarely change hands and the media landscape has been transformed by the internet since the Barclay family paid £665m for it in 2004.Last year The Telegraph reported a pre-tax profit of £39m, up 32pc, on turnover of £254m, up 4pc.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

He steered Goldman's management of $2.7 trillion in assets.Salisbury will reunite with Goldman alums in his new role, including Sixth Street CEO Alan Waxman. The firm manages $65 billion in assets.""The prospect of joining their partnership to help drive the next set of investment opportunities became an obvious and compelling proposition,"" Salisbury wrote in a LinkedIn post.The Goldman veteran joined as an analyst in London in 1998, and later worked in Moscow before moving to New York a decade ago. Salisbury became a partner in 2008 and previously served as global co-head of the asset management unit before it was combined with wealth management under Marc Nachmann last year.""Julian is a seamless fit,"" Waxman said in a statement. ""He has distinguished himself time and again as a superstar investor and business builder.""A wave of senior personnel has exited from Goldman in recent months. Dina Powell McCormick, head of the bank's sovereign business, recently left to join merchant bank BDT &amp; MSD Partners, led by co-CEO Gregg Lemkau, who previously ran investment banking at Goldman. Katie Koch departed after two decades to become CEO of asset manager TCW Group. Goldman is in a crucial phase as it aims to expand in asset management and undo damage from an ill-fated foray into consumer banking.Goldman's asset management division has promoted 11 partners and hired nine new managing directors focused on investing this year, a company spokeswoman said. Its attrition rate is the lowest in years for investors who are managing portfolios, she said.Story continuesSalisbury has ""done a great job putting together all these asset management businesses over the last few years,"" Nachmann said in an interview. ""It’s been great to work with him and I’m excited for him.""Goldman's revenue from asset and wealth management slid 4% to $3.05 billion for the second quarter compared with a year earlier, hurt by losses in real estate investments, the bank reported this month. But it also brought in record management fees and assets under supervision.In a memo announcing Salisbury's departure, Goldman CEO David Solomon credited him with unifying five different investment platforms and joining together its traditional and alternative asset management operations.Solomon's plans to sharpen its focus on key businesses such as asset management and trading are gaining traction with the board, two sources close to him told Reuters earlier this month.Salisbury expressed confidence in the bank's leadership to run the division he helped consolidate.""Julian operated comfortably in emerging markets, like Russia and China, and took over challenged portfolios in tough times, as in the financial crisis,"" former Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein said. ""Always putting the firm first, he was a great partner and I wish him success.""(Reporting by Manya Saini and Niket Nishant in Bengaluru, Lananh Nguyen in New York; Editing by Vinay Dwivedi and Matthew Lewis)]"

GPN is set to report its second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 1, before the opening bell.What Do Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share of $2.58 suggests a 9.3% increase from the prior-year reported figure of $2.36. The consensus mark witnessed no movement in the past week. The consensus mark for second-quarter revenues of $2.2 billion indicates a 6.3% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Global Payments beat the consensus estimate for earnings in one of the prior four quarters, met once and missed on the other two occasions, the average surprise being 0.7%. This is depicted in the graph below:Global Payments Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Global Payments Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseGlobal Payments Inc. price-eps-surprise | Global Payments Inc. QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it is worth taking a look at GPN’s previous-quarter performance first.Q1 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, the leading payment technology company’s adjusted earnings of $2.40 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.4% due to solid contributions from its merchant and core issuer businesses. The merchant business benefited from its expanding presence across worldwide markets. However, an elevated expense level partly offset the upside.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the second-quarter earnings announcement.Q2 Factors to NoteIn the second quarter, profits from GPN’s Merchant Solutions — its biggest operating segment — are likely to have increased from global constant currency volume growth and resilient customer spending. Increased travel and entertainment-related spendings are expected to have benefited the company’s performance.Our estimate for adjusted revenues from Merchant Solutions indicates an around 18% increase from the year-ago period’s reported number. The strong software businesses and continued execution of a technology-enabled strategy are likely to have aided the segment’s results. We expect adjusted operating income from the segment to jump around 15% in the second quarter.Story continuesOur estimate for Issuer Solutions’ adjusted revenues signals 3% year-over-year growth from that reported in the second quarter of 2022. Core issuer constant-currency growth and its expanding commercial card transactions are likely to have aided the segment in the quarter under review. We expect adjusted operating income from the unit to rise over 11% in the second quarter.The above-mentioned factors are expected to have positioned GPN for year-over-year growth. However, our estimate for adjusted revenues from the Consumer Solutions segment is pegged at $25 million, indicating a massive year-over-year decrease due to the divestment of assets and higher unemployment assistance benefits.Profits from the businesses are likely to have been partially offset by increased costs under certain heads in the second quarter, making an earnings beat uncertain. Selling, general and administrative expenses are likely to increase 4.5% year over year. We expect depreciation and amortization to increase more than 8% in the quarter. Continuous investments to upgrade digital capabilities are anticipated to have weighed on the margins.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Global Payments this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is +0.90%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $2.60 per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.58.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Global Payments currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Global Payments, here are some companies from the broader Business Services space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Everi Holdings Inc. EVRI has an Earnings ESP of +4.17% and is a Zacks #1 Ranked player at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Everi’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 24 cents. The consensus estimate has witnessed two upward revisions in the past month against no movement in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the consensus mark for EVRI’s revenues is pegged at $207.8 million, implying 5.4% year-over-year growth.PagSeguro Digital Ltd. PAGS currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.97% and a Zacks Rank of 2.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PagSeguro’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 25 cents per share, which has been unchanged over the past month.

If you want to skip our introduction to the investor, his background, and how some investments have performed over the year, then head on over to Billionaire Jeff Vinik's Top 5 Stocks.Jeff Vinik has a short history in the hedge fund industry. He set up his fund first in the 90s and then shut it down later after making remarkable returns. Then, he tried setting up his fund again but shut it down in less than a year after citing difficulties in raising capital. A graduate of Harvard University, he is known primarily for running one of the biggest mutual funds in the U.S. and then starting his own hedge fund called Vinik Asset Management.Both of these earned him his fair share of fame in the finance industry. Under Mr. Vinik's management, the Fidelity Magellan Fund earned quite a bit of controversy as he was criticized for moving the fund's money away from attractive technology stocks into bonds. This was the time when semiconductor stocks (which are all the buzz these days) were in their early phases of their stock market presence. This was also the time when investing in mutual funds - especially by folks who were using their personal savings  - was peaking, as 3 million Americans had piled $3 trillion into the industry.At Magellan, Mr. Vinik created quite a bit of controversy when it came to light that he had sold large portions of the fund's holdings in semiconductor stocks at a time when the shares were peaking. The semiconductor sector is well known for its cycles of ups and downs, with the latest one undergoing right now as chip makers wait while chip designers' product inventory is digested in the retail chain. Back in the early 1990s, Taiwan and South Korea were rising in stature in the chip world (these two now have some of the most important chip companies in the world). The start of the decade was marked by a strong performance from the Asian firms, but America, which was still a global chip manufacturing base back then, was struggling from an economic contraction in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, high inflation, and high interest rates (the economy is also experiencing somewhat similar conditions over the past year or so).Story continuesThis crunch created the perfect conditions for a boom in 1995 and the subsequent slowdown which was also reflected in the stock market. Just as all this was happening, Mr. Vinik had written to investors of the Magellan Fund that chip firms, such as Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) were solid investments. This was in a letter that was mailed in November as part of the fund's semiannual report. However, controversy surfaced when the Washington Post reported that Mr. Vinik had actually started selling Micron shares in October and before investors received the letter. This selloff was part of a broader exit from the technology sector with other stocks also being sold. Less than a year after his decision, he would quit Magellan and set up his own hedge fund, with some speculating that the increased scrutiny from 1995 contributed to him leaving Fidelity.Vinik Asset Management would go on to make a big impact in the hedge fund industry right off the bat. In the first year, the hedge fund's return would sit at a whopping 93.8% and then go on to an average of 48% for five years. After this burst of performance, Mr. Vinik would return $4.2 billion to investors and close the fund to outside investment in 2000. He would, however, try to open up his hedge fund twice again, first in 2005 and then in 2019. The first run would be quite successful as Vinik Asset Management would go on to operate for nearly eight years before a downturn in gold stocks and other factors would make it return capital. The second run was short lived, with Mr. Vinik explaining that it had become difficult to raise capital.So, today we'll take a look at how his long term investments would have performed ten years after Vinik Asset's final serious foray into the stock market. Some firms that would have performed well are eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR).Billionaire Jeff Vinik's Stock Picks and 10-Year PerformanceOur Methodology To compile our list of Jeff Vinik's long term stock performance, we first listed his fund's top twenty investments during the first quarter of 2013, which is the latest data available. Then, their returns over the past ten years (between April 2013 and July 2023) were calculated, and the companies are listed below.

He didn’t even buy during the dark times of the financial crisis.This big purchase made headlines and was analyzed on Twitter and Stocktwits by stock investors.Insiders Buying En Masse But what about when non-famous insiders buy their company’s stock and when a bunch of them buy en masse?This mass insider buying behavior is called a “cluster buy” and it is the strongest signal you can get in insider trading.When one insider buys, he might be considered an optimist, especially when he’s the CEO, but when four or five insiders all buy at the same time?Now that’s a powerful consensus.But you’re not going to hear about the cluster buys from the media. There aren’t going to be headlines trumpeting the buys of a few corporate Directors and a CFO.Nope. The cluster buy simply isn’t glamorous enough.Investors therefore have to dig below the surface to find the insider cluster buys. But once you do, that’s where big rewards can be found.Cluster Buying Sends the Strongest SignalWhy do insiders spend so much of their money on their own company's stock when they already own a ton of shares already? Greed!Pure and simple.The opportunity to make more money motivates people - even people who are already well off like highly paid CEOs and CFOs.When insiders buy in a cluster, it’s because they all know something very good is going on at the company. Maybe it is a new product. Or contract. Or pending merger. Whatever the reason, they are all very confident that shares will be on the rise.After all, who would buy more stock in a company if they knew it was sinking?  And why would there be several of them buying unless they didn’t collectively believe that their stock was a value?When things at the company are THAT good, insiders don’t want to miss out when everyone else is cashing in. Call it insider peer pressure, if you will.Continued . . .------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Look Inside All Zacks Private Portfolios.

The rally continued into 2022 as energy prices spiked on the Ukraine War. Energy was the best performing S&amp;P 500 sector in 2021 and 2022.From Dec 1, 2020 through Dec 30, 2022, shares of Matador surged 387%.Diving in Yet Again But 2023 brought yet further changes to market conditions, as crude and natural gas prices came back down off their Ukraine War highs.Shares of Matador fell 23.5% through Mar 17, 2023 and the insiders saw yet another buying opportunity. A cluster of 5 insiders bought shares this spring, including the CEO, 2 directors, the EVP of Reservoir Engineering and the President-Operations.Since March, WTI has again re-taken $80 a barrel and Matador has reported record energy production. Shares have been up over 50%, but are currently up 15% from March lows.What did they know?Buy When the Insiders Buy  When high-level insiders buy, they are required to report the purchases to the SEC within 48 hours of the trade. The trade then becomes public information.Hedge funds and other professional investors routinely use this information to get an edge on their trades.For most of us, though, it’s not easy to get access to the insider information.While the media will tout the huge insider buys from celebrity CEOs like Reed Hastings’ Jan 2022 $20 million Netflix share purchase, you’ll almost never hear about the non-celebrity CEOs, or other top-ranked officers when they buy their stocks.Was anyone talking about the 2023 Matador cluster buy?The challenge is getting easy and reliable access to all the insider trades and then figuring out which ones to buy.Where to Find the Cluster Buys Anyone can go on the SEC website and get the insider trading information, but it’s time consuming to search by individual companies.Some investment firms collect the insider buying data and can provide it to you as a daily list. Have you ever seen one of those lists? The sheer number of companies can be overwhelming.And those lists don’t usually separate out the cluster buys, which sometimes take place on different days in the same week.For example, if you’re getting daily insider updates, you may not realize that the CEO bought on Monday but three directors bought on Tuesday. You may pass by those ‘hidden’ cluster buys without even realizing it.Even if you got a list of the cluster buyers, how would you narrow it down to the stocks that are truly worth buying? If I’m going to buy when the insiders are buying, I want to buy only their top picks.Today's Hottest Insider Buys To distill the most promising signals, Zacks' research team developed a strategy that monitors selected insider buying activity at companies that already show strong earnings and valuations.Today only a small selection of stocks meet the demanding criteria of our Insider Trader portfolio.

Currently, a Disney+ Hotstar premium account in India allows logins on up to 10 devices, even though the website states the limit is four.As per a Reuters report, Disney+ Hotstar has tested the enforcement of this policy internally and plans to implement it later this year. “Some people will be incentivized to buy their own subscriptions with new restrictions in place,” one source told Reuters.Netflix also recently revealed a new strategy to combat password sharing in India. The company has started sending warning emails to customers, highlighting that they should use their accounts within a single household only.Why It Matters? Disney initially hoped that a lax policy on multiple device logins would attract subscribers who would eventually purchase their own accounts. Disney+ Hotstar, Netflix, Amazon, and JioCinema have all garnered significant popularity in India. Experts predict that by 2027, these services will help grow the Indian OTT market into a $7 billion (₹57,624 crore) sector.The new restriction will also apply to its cheaper plan, limiting usage across two devices. Disney+ Hotstar led India’s streaming market from January 2022 to March 2023 with a 38% share of viewership.Read next: IPL In Rear View, Disney Star Looks To Make Bank From Cricket World Cup AdvertisingPhoto by Oasishifi on ShutterstockDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

The estimated figure suggests a decline of 47.7% from the prior-year reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s revenues of $32.1 billion indicates a 34.9% decrease from the year-ago reported figure.Factors to NotePhillips 66 is one of the most diversified energy players, having presence in refining, midstream, chemicals and marketing. However, worries about an economic slowdown and recession are likely to have hurt fuel demand in the June quarter, thereby affecting refining operations. We expect adjusted EBITDA from PSX’s refining operations at $2,108.8 million, suggesting a year-over-year decrease of 38.5%.Phillips 66’s midstream business, by its very nature, is less exposed to commodity price volatility and is more stable than other operations. However, we project adjusted EBITDA from midstream operations at $638.8 million, suggesting a decline of 4.7% year over year. Since crude price was lower in the June quarter than the prior-year period, production of crude might have fallen, in turn, reducing the demand for PSX’s midstream business.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Phillips 66 this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

97,40ff2600-efb6-3a32-b69a-135771596f7b,TJX,2023-07-29,10 Safe Haven Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-safe-haven-stocks-billionaires-193752290.html,1690573072,STORY,"['TJX', 'ELV', 'CL', 'PEP']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 10 safe haven stocks billionaires are loading up on. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Safe Haven Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.US markets surged on July 12 after fresh data showed clear signs that inflation is cooling. This was yet another blow to analysts who were vehemently making predictions about recession for about a year now. Last month, after a separate report from the US government on economic data, Yardeni Research’s Ed Yardeni said that the “permabears will have to postpone their imminent recession yet again based on today’s batch of US economic indicators.” The analyst said that the “rolling recession” was becoming “rolling expansion.”Positive economic is also causing research institutes to improve their forecasts on the US economy. For example, Bloomberg’s survey of economists now expect real gross domestic product to be roughly flat next quarter on an annualized basis. This is much better than their previous forecast of a 0.9% decline.But all of this does not mean that the US economy is totally out of recession risk. In fact many believe the economy is still expected to suffer recession but later than expected. A Bloomberg survey still sees a 64% probability of a recession in the next 12 months.This is where defensive and safe haven investments come in. They are not for the recessions only. Wise investors pile into defensive stocks and safe haven assets to hedge against risks and volatility of the market. While gold is deemed as a safe haven asset, it failed to impress investors ever since the rate-hike spree began to hammer the financial markets. On the other hand, safe haven stocks such as defensive companies operating in evergreen sectors posted strong performance in 2022. An important thing to note here is that while billionaire investors showed an increased interest in safe haven and defensive stocks amid recession fears, many of the notable companies that are deemed defensive had been receiving love from billionaire hedge funds since way before the topic of recession started making headlines. Some examples of such solid stocks are Johnson &amp; Johnson, Coca Cola and UnitedHealth. These stocks have been popular among the elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey for years. These companies not only pay consistent dividends, they also have organic growth catalysts and products that are apparently safe from recession environment.Story continuesDespite positive data and a rally in stocks investors have been wary of going all in in the stock market. However, they are putting money in defensive ETFs. A WSJ report quoted Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street, who said:“There’s been a lack of expression of risk during this market rally. There hasn’t been a lot of conviction, and where there is, it’s mainly been into areas of the market you would consider defensive.”Defensive Stocks in Non-Recessionary Environment?When beginner investors make an effort to find defensive stocks, they often tend to focus on metrics like beta and the nature of industries. But data shows that low beta stocks are not always undervalued and one must pay attention to other metrics while choosing defensive plays. For example, when the stock market began to rally in 2023, defensive stocks fell, and their valuations became attractive. Even though the economy is coming out of recession risks, these defensive companies with strong fundamentals and great valuations are still attractive and could reward long-term investors who aren’t just looking for defensive stocks in panic to protect them from the next recession.A 2019 report from State Street Global Advisors mentions an interesting perspective in this regard:“Looking at the valuation of each of the conventionally defensive sectors, we see that the utilities and real estate segments as a whole are trading on a multiple of forecast earnings around 2 points higher than their long-term average. The utilities stocks in the low beta group on average are currently trading at a multiple of 19 times earnings, and the real estate and food &amp; beverage segments are trading at an average of 30 and 21 times earnings, respectively. When we think about investing defensively, risk measures are not enough. Valuation is also important, as are measures of financial strength, growth capability, or other measures of company quality. And the individual assessment of each stock is also not enough. Consideration of the interaction of stocks with one another (correlation) matters, too.”Despite the changing nature of market conditions, billionaire investors almost always maintain exposure to defensive stocks operating in industries like consumer staples, healthcare, utilities, energy, etc. The reason behind this is simple. Most of the notable defensive companies have stable, mature businesses. When financial markets get choppy and storms gather, defensive companies don’t waver. Asset management firm Robeco in a report mentioned that during the period between January 1929 to May 2023, defensive stocks were less volatile and had a lower risk profile when compare to cyclical stocks. The report said that defensive stocks (with beta value of 0.75) “respond less to market movements compared to cyclical stocks with a higher beta of 1.27. This lower sensitivity makes defensive stocks an attractive option for investors seeking to mitigate their exposure to market fluctuations.""Safe Haven Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnOur MethodologyFor this article, we first scanned the DEF - Invesco Defensive Equity ETF and listed all its holdings.

Revenue in the quarter jumped 11.9% year over year to $3.39 billion, surpassing estimates by $230 million.In May Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) cancelled its plan to buy a majority stake in the publicly listed Korean medical device maker M.I.Tech for $230 million amid regulatory concerns.8. The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX)Number of Billionaire Investors: 17Off-price retailer The TJX Companies, Inc.

(NYSE:TJX).Artisan Global Equity Fund made the following comment about The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Also, shares of The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), an off-price retailer of apparel and home goods across North America, Europe and Australia, rose on strong Black Friday sales and market share gains as shoppers searched for deals in physical stores. The company showed that it is maintaining margins and beating earnings estimates on strong sales and by selectively raising prices. TJX’s business model is to sell brand name and designer merchandise in limited quantities at every day discounted prices in stores with flexible, low-cost layouts. Its strategy is to tap into shoppers’ psychological need to “treasure hunt,” as the company describes it, to find unique, branded items at deep discounts. TJX buyers opportunistically purchase merchandise from vendors at deep discounts to keep the cost of goods low for stores. As the largest off-price retailer, the company has used its channel power to its advantage in recent months to gain steep discounts on merchandise as other retailers struggle to clear their inventory. We appreciate the company’s inventory management and pricing  prowess. This holding is an example of our broad universe of companies that we consider for the portfolio and one that we believe is well-positioned for the current market environment.”7. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Billionaire Investors: 18Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) was one of the most sought-after dividend stocks when the stock markets started to get hammered amid inflation and rate hikes. That’s because Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is operating in the consumer defensive space and has increased its dividend consistently for 60 years.Insider Monkey’s database of billionaires' stock holdings shows that 18 billionaires had stakes in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) as of the end of March.

FIS and Colgate have both since “beat and raised” this guidance, indicating that many management teams are adopting very conservative tones in this uncertain macro environment.”6. Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV)Number of Billionaire Investors: 19Health insurance company Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) ranks 6th in our list of the best safe haven stocks billionaires are loading up on. Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) was owned by 19 billionaire hedge fund managers as of the end of the first quarter of 2023, according to Insider Monkey.In April, Morgan Stanley upgraded Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) to Overweight from In Line. The firm likes Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV)’s latest acquisition of BioPlus.BioPlus, which connects payors and providers of specialty pharmaceuticals for patients with complex medical needs, was acquired by Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) as part of its CarepathRx acquisition in February.Madison Investors Fund made the following comment about Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We purchased Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) and trimmed Marsh &amp; McLennan and Arch Capital. Elevance is the largest for-profit Blue Cross Blue Shield plan in the country, supporting the largest domestic membership base across the managed care industry. While national scale is important, local scale is critical as well, given the localized nature of healthcare delivery. Elevance scores well on both fronts, giving it strong bargaining power with providers, lower customer acquisition costs, deep population health data and analytics, and the ability to offer attractive health benefit packages. All this combines to create a formidable moat for its business.We also believe the management team is top-notch. Since joining Elevance from a senior leadership position at peer UnitedHealth Group, CEO Gail Boudreaux has further leveraged the company’s scale advantage by expanding its internal healthcare services capabilities through a newly formed business unit called Carelon. As the industry transitions to a reimbursement system that emphasizes patient outcomes over procedure or testing volume, data analytics will be a crucial tool in managing patient care.

On a year-over-year basis, the top and bottom lines declined.WY’s shares were down 1.9% in the after-hours trading session on Jul 27, after the earnings release.Meanwhile, in July, Weyerhaeuser made a significant acquisition, purchasing 22,000 acres of timberlands in Mississippi for around $60 million. These timberlands are known for their high productivity and have been strategically chosen due to their proximity to Weyerhaeuser's current operations. The acquisition is expected to bring about immediate synergies and create additional opportunities for real estate and natural climate solutions.Inside the HeadlinesThe company reported adjusted earnings of 32 cents per share, beating the consensus mark of 21 cents by 52.4% but decreasing 69.8% from the year-ago reported figure of $1.06 cents.Net sales for the quarter were $1,997 million, missing the consensus mark of $2,028 million by 1.5% and declining 32.8% from the $2,973 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Net sales, however, grew 6.2% sequentially.Adjusted EBITDA came in at $469 million, significantly down from $1,205 million in the year-ago period but an improvement from $395 million in the first quarter of 2023.Weyerhaeuser Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseWeyerhaeuser Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseWeyerhaeuser Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Weyerhaeuser Company QuoteSegment DetailsTimberlands: Net sales (including inter-segment sales of $150 million) from the segment was $567 million, down from the year-ago figure of $671 million. Meanwhile, we expected segment sales to decline 9.6% year over year to $606.4 million in the quarter.Adjusted EBITDA came in at $172 million, down from $219 million in the year-ago quarter.Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources: For the reported quarter, the segment’s net sales amounted to $80 million, down from $117 million a year ago. Our model predicted segment sales to decline 9.7% year over year to $105.6 million.Adjusted EBITDA came in at $70 million, reflecting a decline from $107 million reported in the year-ago level.Wood Products: For the second quarter, segment sales totaled $1,500 million, down from $2,341 million in the prior-year period. We expected segment sales to decline 37.6% year over year to $1,461.2 million in the quarter.Adjusted EBITDA came in at $270 million, significantly down from $912 million a year ago.Story continuesFinancial HighlightsAs of Jun 30, 2023, Weyerhaeuser had cash and cash equivalents of $1,095 million, down from $1,581 million at 2022-end but up from $797 million at March 2023-end. Long-term debt was $4,817 million at the quarter-end, up from $4,071 million at 2022-end and from $4,072 million at March 2023-end.Net cash from operations was $496 million for the second quarter, down from $1,146 million a year ago but up from $126 million in the prior quarter.Q3 OutlookFor the Timberland segment, the company expects earnings (before special items) and adjusted EBITDA to be $25 million low sequentially. In the West, it anticipates moderately lower sales realizations and fee harvest volumes, partially offset by improved per-unit log and haul costs. For the Southern region, the company expects slightly lower sales realizations, with fee harvest volumes and per unit log and haul costs expected to remain on par from the second quarter.In the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment, Weyerhaeuser expects earnings to be sequentially higher. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be approximately $20 million higher than the second quarter, thanks to the timing and mix of sales. The company still expects 2023 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million and expects basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 35% to 40% for the year.Within the Wood Products segment, Weyerhaeuser projects a substantial increase in third-quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA compared to the second quarter, primarily driven by improved average sales prices for lumber and oriented strand board or OSB. However, when excluding the impact of these factors, the company foresees that its third-quarter financial results will be slightly lower than those of the second quarter.Regarding lumber, the company expects a moderate rise in sales volumes, along with a decline in log costs and slightly reduced unit manufacturing costs. As for OSB, Weyerhaeuser anticipates comparable sales volumes and fiber costs but slightly higher unit manufacturing costs. Turning to engineered wood products, the company foresees a slight increase in sales volumes. However, it expects slightly lower sales realizations and faces higher raw material costs, primarily attributable to oriented strand board webstock.Zacks RankCurrently, WY sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our media relations team whose contact information can be found in the release. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug? Douglas Peterson: Thank you, Mark. As we look at this quarter's highlights, I want to remind you that the financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to the non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise. We're pleased to report 7% revenue growth in the second quarter, excluding the impact of Engineering Solutions in all periods. We saw acceleration in revenue growth in Market Intelligence, Ratings and Indices, while growth remained in the high single digits for both Commodity Insights and Mobility. As you will recall, we took decisive action to protect margins beginning in the second quarter of last year and lapping those actions led to a modest contraction in adjusted operating margins year-over-year. Our continued focus on delivering profitable growth and prudently managing our capital allocation combined to drive double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share this quarter.We expect positive revenue growth in all divisions for the remainder of year, as well as continued double-digit adjusted EPS growth. In addition to strong financial results, we remain focused on executing our long-term strategy with an emphasis on innovation. We continue to drive rapid advancement in our AI initiatives. We'll talk more about the guiding principles behind our AI strategy in a moment, but we already have a number of internal initiatives and pilot programs. Additionally, in May, we launched a conversational AI assistant called ChatIQ on Capital IQ Pro Labs for internal testing. We'll have more to say about ChatIQ as we get closer to a formal launch to external customers, but it's the first example of how Kensho will deploy LLM-based technology across S&amp;P Global.We're also very excited about some of the developments in our conversations with the largest participants in the private markets. We have an active and incredibly productive dialogue with private equity and private credit customers. We're currently exploring many ways that we can work together to apply our expertise in ratings, analytics and pricing across the credit markets. We'll have more specifics to share here as well as this dialogue develops into commercial opportunities. We're seeing some early, but encouraging signs of stabilization in the macro environment, which leads to a modest improvement to the macro outlook, helping inform our financial guidance. Lastly, illustrating our commitment to disciplined stewardship of the business, we completed the divestiture of Engineering Solutions in the second quarter.We continue to align our goals and operations against the five strategic pillars we introduced at Investor Day. First, I want to provide an update on what we're seeing and hearing from our customers. We've mentioned over the last couple of quarters that we've seen some lengthening of the sales cycle, which we believe was driven by customer sensitivity around spending. Our cross-sell efforts are also creating larger contracts, which take longer to close. While sales cycles remain a bit longer than normal, we've started to see some stabilization and customer conversations have been very constructive. We continue to see high customer retention rates and contract expansions, evidenced by the 8% growth in subscription revenue across our five divisions.The value of our largest and most well-known products, those key brands and benchmarks that the markets rely on is being recognized by our customers in a challenging and sometimes confusing macro environment. Customers are also emphasizing many of the same strategic priorities that we are namely private markets, climate, energy transition and AI. This is evidenced in the 40% growth in energy transition revenue we saw in our Commodity Insights division in the second quarter. As customers navigate a market with higher interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty and rapidly evolving technology, we hear they trust S&amp;P Global and they want to do more with us. We've worked hard to build that trust, and we're as confident as we've ever been in the long-term growth of the company.Related to Ratings, global billed issuance returned to positive growth, increasing 8% year-over-year in the second quarter. We began to see some signs of stabilizing interest rates among central banks. While we did see some likely event driven issuance in the second quarter ahead of the debt ceiling events in the United States, we're also seeing more economists, including our own, expecting only one or two more rate hikes from major central banks over the remainder of 2023. Overall, issuance saw a higher proportion of refinancing activity with issuers tracking market conditions closely. We expect those pockets of issuance to become more frequent as the market adjusts to the new normal of higher for longer. We're pleased with the strength we saw in corporate issuance with both high yield and investment grade issuance increasing notably year-over-year, though the high yield growth is coming off of a very low comparison.This strength is offset somewhat by a softer environment for bank loans and structured finance. Importantly, rating withdrawals, which are a measure of churn in ratings, are down this year. That illustrates the strength of the S&amp;P brand and the increasing value of a rating in an uncertain credit environment. Next, I'd like to focus on our strategic priority to grow and innovate. The June release of updates and enhancements of Capital IQ Pro was one of the largest and most significant in years. We completely reinvented RatingsDirect on Capital IQ Pro and launched loan pricing and analytics as well. Customers have already shown an incredibly positive reaction to the enhancements on Capital IQ Pro. And these new features have contributed to key competitive displacements and enhanced our competitive positioning.In Commodity Insights, we also launched the first offering of base shipping rates incorporating alternative fuel pricing. This is significant as we expect the maritime sector's use of alternative fuels including liquid natural gas to grow significantly in the coming years. Our Sustainable1 team launched a new nature and biodiversity risk data set, assessing nature related impacts and dependencies across the company's operations. This assessment can be applied across the asset, company and portfolio level, which gives our corporate and investor customers a greater ability to quantify both dependency and impact on location specific ecosystems. As we introduced last quarter, our Vitality revenue metric consists revenue derived from our new or substantially enhanced products.We're pleased that in the second quarter, Vitality revenue held steady at 11% of total revenue. I'm both pleased and impressed that the top four contributors to our Vitality revenue in the quarter came from four different divisions, clearly demonstrating that our commitment to innovation and growth spans the entire organization. Turning now to a topic that I know is on everyone's mind, artificial intelligence. I wanted to provide some color on S&amp;P Global's key advantages and the guiding principles that will govern our use and the implementation of AI, both internally and within our products. We're thrilled with the progress that our teams have made building, testing and implementing tools in various use cases across the organization. While Kensho gives us an incredible advantage in this arena, it isn't our only one.The datasets we have, large, proprietary and truly differentiated, create a remarkable advantage for S&amp;P Global as well. Our trusted brands also allow us to have conversations with industry partners, technology infrastructure providers and customers with credibility. We, through our brands, are known and trusted, and we know that trust will play a huge role in the success of any AI based products that come to market in the coming years. As we more fully embrace the technological advances of our era, we need to make sure we do so with prudence and discipline. Particularly given the investment necessary to develop AI driven tools, we want to take each step with a keen focus on creating customer value rather than simply creating tools because the technology exists.We will allocate the necessary capital to these new projects based on our confidence in the strategic and financial impact on the company. While Kensho is deeply engaged in AI research within S&amp;P Global, we want to make sure we aren't dogmatic in our approach. We'll leverage leading technology regardless of whether it was developed at Kensho, developed elsewhere within the divisions or come via a vendor or a partner. Lastly, we want to continue our practice of aggressively defending and protecting our intellectual property and data. We have safeguards and restrictions embedded in our contracts that ensure third parties and customers cannot independently monetize or build commercial products with our data without our consent and our economic participation.We're committed to transparency with our shareholders, and we'll provide regular updates on our new product launches as they take place. We'll move fast. And we'll also make the necessary investments in time and resources to ensure success. Shifting now to how we lead and inspire. During the second quarter, we further demonstrated our commitment to transparency and accountability through the publication of our Annual Sustainability Impact Report and TCFD Report. We also published for the first time our annual Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report, highlighting our commitment to building a more diverse, equitable and inclusive company and world. We're honored that so many respected organizations have recognized the efforts that we have made to build a company that always pursues excellence.As you can see on this slide, we received recognition not just for our efforts in sustainability and equality, but also in our governance and board oversight and our civic contributions. I've never been more proud to be part of S&amp;P Global. Of course, disciplined leadership means delivering on our ongoing operational and financial outcomes. We are pleased with the strong execution across all divisions this quarter. We saw positive revenue growth in all of our divisions in the second quarter, including accelerating revenue growth in Market Intelligence, Ratings and Indices. While our trailing 12-month margins have contracted 90 basis points year-over-year, we expect that trend to improve as we progress through this year and lap the issuance headwinds we saw through most of last year.With half of the year behind us, we still see many of the same macroeconomic factors impacting our business through the remainder of the year. While we no longer expect a technical recession globally, we do expect headwinds to persist from an economic slowdown, primarily in financial services end markets. We expect to continue to benefit from secular trends, though near term volatility can impact different parts of the business in different ways. While these market expectations are mostly unchanged from the first half, we wanted to reiterate our confidence in the multi-year financial targets we put out for divisions and for the consolidated company at Investor Day. As you know, our Ratings financial results and guidance are closely tied to billed issuance.And for 2023, we now expect issuance to be up approximately 4% to 8% for the full year, up one point from our prior expectation. Our latest Ratings research group forecast calls for a decline in global market issuance, though also slightly improved from last quarter. As a reminder, market issuance can differ materially from billed issuance with divergence this year driven by declines in unrated debt and sovereign international public finance, which don't impact billed issuance. We have completed our July 2023 global refinancing study. And you can see one of the reasons for our for our optimism Ratings business over the next several years. There is over $8 trillion of debt rated by S&amp;P Global maturing through 2026 and nearly $13 trillion maturing through 2028.This, in addition to assumed improvements in the macro environment over the next few years, gives us great confidence in our ability to drive profitable multiyear growth in Ratings. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?See also 15 Best Russell 2000 Stocks to Buy and 20 Oldest Richest Families in the USEwout Steenbergen: Thank you, Doug. As a reminder, the financial metrics that we'll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise. We're pleased with the financial performance of the business in second quarter. The clear indicator is that the secular tailwinds continue to drive growth across our largest products, though some minor headwinds impact smaller parts of the business. Adjusted earnings per share increased 11% year-over-year. This growth was driven by a combination of 4% revenue growth and a 6% reduction in fully diluted share count, partially offset by approximately 100 basis points of operating margin compression. Excluding the impact of Engineering Solutions in all periods, but including approximately $10 million from this year's tuck-in acquisitions, revenue growth would have been 7%.Revenue in the quarter was driven by growth across all remaining divisions, including Ratings, which saw a pickup in issuance activity the quarter. While the debt markets remain a challenging environment for issuers, this is the third quarter in a row of sequential improvement. As Doug mentioned, we also saw acceleration in revenue growth across Market Intelligence and Indices with continued impressive growth in Commodity Insights and Mobility. We will walk through the divisions in more detail a moment. Adjusted expenses were up 6% year-over-year, which we'll also discuss in more detail. Turning to our strategic growth initiatives. Sustainability and energy transition revenue increased 17% to $70 million in the quarter, driven by climate and physical risk products and CI's energy transition products.We continue to see a shift in customer appetite away from buying pure ESG scores and towards more purchases of raw data, which we believe will benefit S&amp;P Global in the long run. We consistently hear from customers that our Trucost data set is higher quality than the data from many competitors. And the breadth of our offerings across the commodity markets and ESG Indices will contribute to strong growth for multiple years. That said, we are seeing some signs of adverse market sentiment, particularly from large financial institutions in the United States that are impacting our revenue growth in the short-term as others in the space have also called out. We believe these headwinds are temporary, while the growth drivers are secular. Even though sustainability and energy transition revenue currently represents only a low single digit percent of our total revenue, it is an important strategic driver of long-term growth.We will continue to make the necessary investments in people, data, product development and partnerships to drive long-term growth. Given the uncertainty around the regulatory landscape and the political climate, particularly in the U.S., we can no longer confidently reiterate the previous 2026 target of $800 million in sustainability and energy transition. We'll continue to report this metric on a quarterly basis. And we will assess the potential for long-term revenue contribution from these important products as the market continues to evolve. Private market solutions revenue increased 5% to $106 million, driven by strong growth in Market Intelligence products for private markets, offset by declines in Ratings private markets revenue. Vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization, of $343 million in the second quarter, representing a 14% increase compared to prior year.Now turning to synergies. In the second quarter of 2023, we recognized $144 million of expense savings due to cost synergies. And our annualized run rate exiting the quarter was $574 million and we continue to expect our year-end run rate to be approximately $600 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well with $17 million in synergies achieved in the second quarter and an annualized run rate of $68 million. Turning to expense growth. Total adjusted expenses increased 6% year-over-year as we are beginning to lap the proactive expense management actions taken last year. We saw a $23 million favorable impact from FX in the quarter, and the divestiture of Engineering Solutions was favorable by $50 million. We also generated incremental cost synergies that lowered expense growth by approximately $80 million relative to last year.As you will recall, we lowered accruals for incentive compensation in the second quarter of last year. This was done to reflect the headwinds we were facing, predominantly in our Ratings business. Incentive compensation resets each year, so we're seeing the natural increase in those expenses beginning this quarter. Incentive compensation and commissions were the largest single contributor to expense growth in the second quarter. The year-over-year impact of incentive compensation will be a similar driver of expense growth in the third quarter, though we expect expense growth to moderate meaningfully in the fourth quarter as the comparison becomes more favorable. The year-over-year impact of the reset of incentive compensation was a key driver of expense growth in each of our divisions, and we expect to see the same quarterly phasing in our division margin results in the third quarter and fourth quarter as well.Lastly, we continue to invest to drive long-term growth, and that was reflected this quarter. Core investment growth represents the investments we are making in strategic initiatives, people, cloud as well the incremental investments we are making to fund our AI development at Kensho and within the divisions. Most importantly, we continue to expect approximately 50 to 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the full year. Now, let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 6% driven by strong growth in data and advisory solutions and enterprise solutions. Desktop grew 4% in the second quarter driven by strong subscription growth as ACV growth outpaced revenue in the quarter, though this was offset by some modest softness in non-recurring sales.Renewal rates remained strong in the mid to high 90s. Data and advisory solutions and enterprise solutions both benefited from solid growth in subscription based offerings. Credit and risk solutions continues to see strong new sales for RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect products, as well as double-digit growth in credit analytics. Adjusted expenses increased 7% year-over-year due to the drivers previously discussed. Operating profit increased 4%, and the operating margin decreased 70 basis points to 32.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins improved to 220 basis points. As we mentioned last quarter, we know the comparisons will get easier as we progress through the year. And we continue to expect improvements in those products within Enterprise Solutions that depend on capital markets activity.We also expect revenue synergies to begin positively impacting results in the back half of the year. Last quarter, we signaled that we may come in at the low end of our previous guidance range. We're not trying to signal deterioration since April, though we do see modestly elevated risk to the back half. Given the heightened uncertainty, particularly within sustainability and energy transition, we're taking the formal step at this point to modestly lower the guidance by 50 basis points on revenue and operating margin. Now turning to Ratings. In the second quarter, we saw a spike in issuance activity, particularly in May, which from a seasonality perspective is a very important month for debt markets. Revenue increased 7% year-over-year. This marks the third quarter in a row of sequential improvement in transaction revenue, and we saw investment grade and high yield activity pick up.Non-transaction revenue increased 4% primarily due to annual fees and growth in CRISIL, though non-transaction growth was tempered by continued declines in ICR revenue. Adjusted expenses increased 12%. This resulted in a 4% increase in operating profit and a 180 basis point decrease in operating margin to 57.7%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins are still impacted by last year's revenue declines. We raised our billed issuance assumption for 2023 and expect issuance to increase in the range of 4% to 8%, reflecting the stronger issuance trends in the first half. Our outlook for transaction revenue for the full year has improved somewhat, though some of this is offset by non-transaction revenue due to greater weakness in ICR than we initially anticipated.The net result is a one point increase in our Ratings revenue guidance range and we now expect Ratings revenue growth of 5% to 7%. While we expect expense growth to moderate as progress through the year, we are reiterating our margin guidance. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue growth increased 8% driven by double-digit growth in both price assessments and energy and resources data and insights. Growth was tempered somewhat by declines in the upstream business. Upstream data and insights declined approximately 2% year-over-year. While subscription ACV growth is positive, we have deprioritized one-time sales in upstream as we focus on higher quality recurring revenue products. As such, we are lowering our expectations modestly for upstream for the full year and now expect that business line to be flat to down slightly for the full year compared to our previous expectation for low single digit growth.Price assessments and energy and resources data and insights grew 12% and 11%, respectively compared to prior year driven by strong performance in crude oil and fuels and refining products and strong commercial momentum in subscription products across both business lines. Advisory and transaction revenue also grew 12% driven by strength in global trading services and strong performance in conference revenue in the quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 5%. Operating profit for CI increased 12%, and operating margin improved 160 basis points to 45.6%. Trailing 12-month margins have improved 220 basis points. We see stronger trends for our benchmarks, data and insights, and we enjoy a position of trust in the commodity markets. We continue to expect strong subscription growth through the second half, and there is no change to our outlook for revenue or margins.In our Mobility division, revenue increased 10% year-over-year driven by continued new business growth in CARFAX, the contribution from Market Scan within the Dealer segment and strong underwriting volumes in the financials and other business lines. Dealer revenue increased 12% year-over-year driven by the continued benefit of price increases within the last year and new store growth, particularly in CARFAX for life and used car subscription products. Manufacturing grew 5% year-over-year driven by elevated recall activity and continued strength in marketing solutions. Financials and other increased 9% as the business line continues to see healthy underwriting volumes and a favorable pricing environment similar to last quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 13% due primarily to the drivers I discussed previously, but also due to the inorganic contribution to expenses from the Market Scan acquisition.This resulted in a 5% increase in adjusted operating profit and 160 basis points of operating margin contraction year-over-year. Trailing 12-month margins have contracted 60 basis points. As we noted last quarter, we expect the Market Scan acquisition to contribute approximately 150 basis points of revenue growth in the full year, though we expect it to be modestly dilutive to adjusted margins in 2023. And our guidance for Mobility for the full year is unchanged. Turning to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 3%, primarily due to strong growth in exchange rated derivatives volume and data subscriptions, partially offset by a modest decline in asset-linked fees. Asset-linked fees were down 1% year-over-year primarily driven by mix shift into lower priced index ETF products, partially offset by market depreciation and modest year-over-year net inflows.Importantly, this decline was due to mix shift, not due to price concessions or renegotiated contracts. Exchange rated derivatives revenue increased 17% on increased trading volumes across all key contracts. Data and custom subscriptions increased 3% year-over-year driven by continued strength in end-of-day contract growth. During the quarter, expenses increased 15% year-over-year due to reasons previously discussed. Operating profit in Indices decreased 2%, and the operating margin decreased 330 basis points from last year's high watermark to 68.6%. Trailing 12-month margins have contracted 30 basis points. As reflected in today's results, we've seen market depreciation, the mix of AUM is playing an increasingly important role in asset-linked fees revenue.And net inflows remain somewhat unpredictable in the near term. All of this is reflected in our new higher guidance range. As we mentioned last quarter, our continued investments to drive long-term growth as well as the timing of expense recognition will impact the quarterly phasing of our margins. We expect relatively high expense growth in Indices in the third quarter as well before expense growth moderates in the fourth quarter. This will ultimately allow us to deliver margins within the new higher guidance range of 67.5% to 68.5%. Now, let's move to the latest views from our economists who are forecasting global GDP growth of 2.9% in 2023. We're no longer calling for a global recession, though we do expect lower-than-normal economic activity through the remainder of year.We continue to expect inflation above the target rates of central banks and energy prices like crude oil to remain above historical averages as well. As we consider how all of this will ultimately impact our financial performance in 2023, let's turn to our guidance. This slide represents our GAAP guidance for headline metrics. Adjusted guidance for the company reflects the results through the first half as well as our most recent views on the macroeconomic environment and market conditions. Our full year guidance is largely unchanged on a consolidated basis as outperformance in Ratings and Indices is offset by slightly lower expectations for Market Intelligence as we've begun to signal last quarter. We have provided the granular guidance on corporate unallocated expense, deal related amortization, interest expense and tax rate in the supplemental deck posted to our IR site.The final slides in this deck illustrate our revenue and margin guidance by division, reflecting the drivers that I mentioned previously. In conclusion, we're pleased with the results from the second quarter, particularly with the return to strong double-digit growth in both Ratings transaction revenue and our adjusted diluted EPS. With multiple variables at play in the markets, we're encouraged by the fact that the tailwinds tend to impact the largest parts of our business, while the headwinds are impacting relatively small contributors to our financial results. It takes tremendous effort from many talented people to deliver results like these. And I would like to thank my colleagues around the world for their relentless drive to power global markets.We're looking forward to delivering a strong second half of the year. And with that, I would like to invite Edouard Tavernier, President of S&amp;P Global Mobility, to join us. And I will turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.A - Mark Grant: Thank you, Ewout.

A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.Story continuesMichael Miebach: Thank you, Devin. Good morning, everyone. So starting with the big picture. Our momentum continued into the second quarter with net revenue up 15% and operating income up 16%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, once again demonstrating the strong fundamentals of our business. Consumer spending has remained resilient with spend on experiences and travel remaining a focus. On the macroeconomic front, we continue to monitor a number of factors. First, the overall labor market remains strong, including wage growth, and consumers continue to be supported by credit and savings. These are key factors of consumer spending. Second, the efforts of central banks to curb inflation are showing signs of progress.Despite this, inflation remains elevated, and we are in a period of tight monetary policy across many countries. Economic growth will continue to vary country by country and sector by sector. Looking at our switched volume trends. Domestic volume growth remains healthy. We continue to see strength in T&amp;E with some recent moderation in both inflation and spend in select international markets. Cross-border travel continues to show strength, reaching 154% of 2019 levels in the second quarter. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this trend with our travel-oriented portfolios and our initiatives in areas like loyalty and marketing. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to hold up well. We're monitoring the environment closely and are ready to adjust investment levels as appropriate while maintaining focus on our key strategic priorities.As a reminder, these priorities are: one, expanding in payments; two, extending our services; and three, embracing new networks. First, we're expanding in payments by continuing to win deals with a diverse set of customers, powering growth and acceptance, capturing a prioritized set of new payment flows, and exploring new ways to ensure payment choice by leveraging multiple alternatives, including card rails, ACH, blockchain and open banking. Back to the top of this list. We are winning deals across the globe through a combination of our innovative products, differentiated services and our solution-selling approach. I'll share a few examples from each region. Let's start in Europe, where we announced a significant win with UniCredit across all card products.We expanded our partnership and put in place a first-of-its-kind, single-card, multi-market strategy spanning 13 banks, 12 markets and 20 million cards. UniCredit selected Mastercard due to our innovative digital capabilities, shared focus on sustainability and proven ability to support their client needs. In Germany, the previously announced conversion of approximately 10 million of Deutsche Bank's credit and debit cards to Mastercard has now started. These wins build on our prior success in the U.K., where there are now 16 million NatWest Debit Mastercards live in market. When combined with the Santander and First Direct migrations, approximately 27 million debit cards have now shifted to Mastercard across these 3 portfolios in the U.K. Turning to North America.Mastercard will partner with Fiserv's money network for all U.S. state and federal government benefit and wage disbursement debit programs. Up north, Coast Capital, Canada's largest Federal credit union, will be converting their consumer and small business portfolios to Mastercard. The partnership highlights our shared commitment to local communities with issuance through Collabria Financial Services. In addition, we have a new agreement with Tim Hortons, the largest quick-service restaurant brand in Canada. Tim Hortons will launch a new Mastercard credit card and will be using a broad set of Mastercard's digital, analytics and fraud services and technologies. Our relationship with Santander in Latin America continues to grow. In Mexico, we established a long-term exclusive deal with Openbank, their new digital bank.We also renewed the Fiesta Rewards co-brand credit card, Santander's key offering within their consumer portfolio. In Brazil, we will be Santander's exclusive partner across their commercial portfolio. And we've expanded our partnership with fast-growing Sicredi, one of Brazil's largest credit unions. In Asia Pacific, we've extended our relationship with Standard Chartered Bank, which will enable us to grow our consumer credit presence across key markets in the region. We've also expanded our partnership with HSBC through the launch of the Travel One Card in Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam. Travel One will provide instant in-app rewards redemption powered by the Mastercard Rewards system. With all of these cards, people do need a place to use them.We continue to power growth and acceptance by establishing new partnerships and scaling new technologies. This quarter, we announced partnerships with both Alipay and WeChat Pay to enable international travelers to easily link any Mastercard credit or debit card to Alipay and WeChat Pay digital wallets. The partnership allows visitors to make payments with tens of millions of QR code merchants across China. I just returned from China, where I saw firsthand how this is helping international travelers shop and pay in more places in a simple way. It's like paying like a local. And this will be valuable as inbound cross-border travel to China improves from approximately 50% of 2019 levels in the second quarter. In the online environment, we are scaling our Click to Pay capability to enhance the guest checkout experience.Click to Pay transactions grew over 70% year-over-year in the second quarter, and the technology is now live in 30 markets. In the quarter, we added Chile, Bahrain and Slovakia. And NatWest Group became the first bank in the U.K. to go live with Click to Pay push provisioning for cardholders. Shifting to New Payment Flows. We are making tangible progress in this area. In commercial point of sale, we've extended our partnership with Brex to support the international expansion of their commercial portfolios. We expanded our relationship with myPOS continuing to drive new merchant acceptance across more than 30 European markets while also migrating their small business debit portfolio to Mastercard. And we've established an exclusive partnership with Australian lender, Grow Finance, to introduce credit cards to their small business customers later this year.In B2B accounts payable, we remain the market leaders in virtual card. We continue to drive growth by tapping into new use cases. For example, we established an exclusive partnership with EasyTransfer in Greater China. This competitive flip leverages our virtual card capabilities to support cross-border tuition payments for international students. We're also making it easy for buyers and suppliers to integrate virtual cards into the technology platforms they already use. Building on our prior announcements with SAP and Coupa, we've recently partnered with GEP to integrate our virtual card technology into their payables platform. And on the supplier side, we launched Mastercard Receivables Manager with Billtrust. The solution streamlines the processing of virtual card transactions for suppliers and automates the integration of reconciliation data into accounts receivable systems.This is a great solution. And it builds on partnerships with companies like Boost Payment Solutions, who have been working closely with Mastercard to expand and optimize commercial acceptance. And finally, in new flows, we continue to deploy our disbursement and remittances capabilities in new ways and across new geographies. In the U.S., we partner with top sports gaming processor, Interchecks, who will make Mastercard Send available to gaming operators for payouts. Careem Pay, one of the largest digital wallets in UAE, will use Send to top up their wallets using Mastercard. And on the cross-border front, we partnered with Al Fardan Exchange in Qatar to facilitate remittance services and support cross-border travel. Our work in real-time ACH continues to support these new flows.Our circular approach has been to expand our infrastructure reach into new markets. Going forward, we will be focusing on delivering and scaling in the markets we already are serving while building applications and services in these key locations, in line with our overall strategic and financial objectives. And in blockchain, we're introducing the MasterCard Multi-Token Network, MTN. MTN is a set of foundational capabilities designed to make transactions within digital asset and blockchain ecosystems, more secure, scalable and interoperable. We believe in the potential of blockchain technologies. However, regulated money, such as bank deposits and CBDCs, need to be part of the solution, and they should interoperate with traditional systems.Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), Card, Logo, Sign, Symbol, Money, Dollars, Bank, Finance, Business, pay, expressValeri Potapova / Shutterstock.comWe can help with that. MTN is the natural evolution of the work we have already done in this space. The initial sandbox will kick off in the U.K. this summer. Now turning to services. Our services inform decision-making of our customers. They help them create stronger connections and greater loyalty. Payments and services reinforce each other, multiplying our impact and the value we deliver to all our partners. Our services help many -- drive many of the wins I mentioned earlier. So here are a few additional examples. We recently launched our Consumer Fraud Risk solution, which leverages our latest AI capabilities and the unique network view of real-time payments I just mentioned to help banks predict and prevent payment scams. AI is a foundational technology used across our business and has been a game changer in helping identify such fraud patterns.We've partnered with 9 U.K. banks, including Barclays, Lloyds Bank, Halifax, Bank of Scotland, NatWest, Monzo and TSB to stop scam payments before funds leave a victim's account. TSB, one of the first banks to adopt the solution, indicated that it has already dramatically increased its fraud detection since deploying the capability. We're combining our loyalty, consulting, analytics and identity services in different ways to help our customers capitalize on the travel recovery. This quarter, we extended our broad-based partnership with Expedia Group. Together, we will combine Mastercard's loyalty solution with Expedia's extensive travel supply to enable Mastercard cardholders to book travel using loyalty points. We also partnered with Thomas Cook in India to issue prepaid cards for international travel.The proposition includes cardholder access to over 450 cross-border travel offers through Mastercard Travel Rewards. And earlier this month, I met with our partners at Deutsche Bank and Lufthansa in Frankfurt. We resigned our long-standing partnerships with Lufthansa Group for its Miles &amp; More loyalty program and welcomed Deutsche Bank as the new issuing partner. In this enhanced relationship, you will see a combination of our loyalty solutions, personalization capabilities and digital user experiences help the partnership take off to the next level using airlines peak. We're also leveraging our personalization in Test &amp; Learn capabilities to help our partners across the ecosystem enhance the customer experience and improve acquisition and conversion rates.For example, the combined Dynamic Yields personalization capabilities with our marketing services to drive digital customer acquisition for Ecobank in Nigeria. In addition, HP Inc. has partnered with us to deploy personalized bank content for their consumers across Canada and Europe. And on the merchant side, we are working with 7-Eleven in Australia using our Test &amp; Learn capabilities to support their rollout of new store concepts and evolve its food and beverage offerings. Our third strategic priority area is embracing new networks with a focus on open banking and digital identity. We continued to make progress in open banking and established a series of new and expanded collaborations this quarter, including ones with Freddie Mac, Algon based out of France and Dapi in the UAE.These entities will leverage our smart and consumer permission data to drive increased financial inclusion and make digital interaction simpler and safer. Turning to digital identity. We're driving adoption across several new verticals, including travel, ticketing, retail and financial institutions. Travel provider, FlightHub, is using our identity solutions to help travelers book their new next adventure. Sports teams across the U.S., including the New Jersey Devils, use these solutions to enable fans to buy tickets while reducing fraud on ticketing platforms. Major League Baseball used our NuDetect technology to ensure that All-Star votes were authentic for this year's All-Star game. In retail, we partner with IKEA, who is using Ekata to help reduce friction and fraud.And financial institutions like Greenwood, a digital banking platform for Black and Latinx communities are using our capabilities to authenticate consumers in real time, making financial empowerment a reality for more people. So in summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth, supported by resilient consumer spending, particularly in travel and experiences. Our strong deal momentum continues with new wins and expanded relationships powered by our services across a range of partners, including UniCredit, Fiserv, Tim Hortons, Brex and many more. Our differentiated capabilities, diversified business model and focused strategy positions us well to capitalize on the significant opportunity ahead. Sachin, over to you.Sachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael. So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 15%, reflecting resilient consumer spending and the continued recovery of cross-border travel as well as the continued growth in our value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 13%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. And operating income was up 16%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased 11% and 14%, respectively, both reflecting a sizable discrete tax expense this quarter related to foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil.EPS of $2.89 includes a $0.22 reduction due to the discrete tax expense I just mentioned and an $0.08 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $497 million through July 24, 2023. So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 12% year-over-year on a local currency basis. In the U.S., GDV increased by 6% with credit growth of 8% and debit growth of 3%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 16% with credit growth of 14% and debit growth of 17%. Of note, we have now completed the NatWest debit migration in the U.K. Overall, cross-border volume increased 24% globally for the quarter on a local currency basis, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border spending.While this is sequentially lower versus Q1, this is due to tougher comps as we opened up post-Omicron last year. When you look at the trend versus 2019, you see continued strength. For example, cross-border travel is at 154% of 2019 levels in Q2, which is up 6 ppt from the prior quarter. On the same basis, cross-border card-not-present excluding travel continues to hold up well in relation to 2019 levels, up 2 ppt from the prior quarter to 210%. Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 17% year-over-year in Q2. Both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remained strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration as contactless now represents over 60% of all in-person switched purchase transactions.In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 3.2 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Turning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenues for the second quarter, which came in above our expectations. As a reminder, earlier this year, we revised our disaggregated revenue disclosure. Net revenues are now broken down into 2 new categories: payment network and value-added services and solutions. Now getting into the numbers described on a currency-neutral basis. Payment network net revenue increased 15% primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Payment network net revenue was higher than anticipated primarily due to higher revenues related to FX volatility and the timing of planned deal activity.Value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 16% primarily due to the continued healthy growth of our Cyber &amp; Intelligence solutions driven by our underlying driver growth and the demand for our fraud and security solutions, and strong demand for consulting and marketing services, which was partially offset by other solutions. Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network, again, described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric. Domestic assessments were up 11%, while worldwide GDV grew 12%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border assessments increased 29%, while cross-border volumes increased 24%. The 5 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter.Transaction processing assessments were up 16%, while switched transactions grew 17%. The 1 ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year. Other network assessments related to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees were $270 million this quarter. As a reminder, these other network assessments may fluctuate from period to period. Moving on to Page 8. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 13% primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives. Now turning to Page 9. Let me first comment on the operating metrics trends in the second quarter.Versus 2019, overall spending has remained resilient. When viewed year-over-year on a sequential basis, we are seeing some moderation in both inflation and spend in select international markets as well as more difficult comps. As it relates to the first 3 weeks of July, our metrics are holding up well, generally in line with Q2 when indexed to 2019. Just for your information, we have included all the data points from this schedule excluding activity from Russian-issued cards from current and prior periods in the appendix. Turning to Page 10. I want to share our thoughts on the remainder of the year. Let me start by saying that our business fundamentals continue to remain strong as overall consumer spending remains healthy and we continue to deepen our relationships with partners across the globe.Domestic spending patterns have broadly normalized postpandemic. Cross-border travel continues to grow at a healthy pace, now above 150% of 2019 levels. While the travel recovery has progressed well in most regions, there remain pockets of opportunity, notably into and out of China. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this continued growth with our travel-oriented portfolios and related service offerings. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to hold up well. While we are monitoring a number of macro and geopolitical factors, our base case scenario for the year continues to assume consumer spending remains resilient, buoyed by strong labor market and reflects current spending dynamics and the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel.For the year, our outlook is broadly unchanged. We expect net revenue growth for the full year 2023 to remain in the low teens range on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. As a reminder, this growth rate would have been approximately 1.5 ppt higher if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of 1 ppt for the year, and we expect a minimal impact from acquisitions. Our expectations for operating expense for the year are also unchanged with growth expected to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to add about 1 ppt to this growth, and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 0 to 1 ppt for the year.As Michael mentioned, we are prepared to proactively adjust our operating expenses if we see meaningful changes to top line growth. With respect to the third quarter, year-over-year net revenue is expected to grow at a low double-digit rate, again, on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. Coming off a strong Q2, this sequentially reflects a lower anticipated contribution to growth from revenues related to FX volatility. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 3 ppt, and acquisitions are not expected to have much of an impact for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q3 growth to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items.Acquisitions are forecast to add approximately 0 to 1 ppt to this growth, and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 1 to 2 ppt. Other items to keep in mind. First, on the other income and expense line, we forecast an expense of approximately $90 million for Q3. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Second, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of between 18% and 19% for Q3 and Q4 based on the current geographic mix of our business and the recent U.S. tax guidance that allows for more tax credits to be claimed related to 2022 and 2023. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin.Devin Corr: Thank you, Sachin.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Mastercard (NYSE:MA), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Mastercard How Quickly Is Mastercard Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. We can see that in the last three years Mastercard grew its EPS by 14% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Mastercard maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 13% to US$24b. That's encouraging news for the company!The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Mastercard's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Mastercard Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Mastercard has a market capitalisation of US$372b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$396m. This comes in at 0.1% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Does Mastercard Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Mastercard is that it is growing profits. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth.

107,2ff05ce7-cfd0-3c6e-917a-3029bcb65477,MA,2023-07-29,What Are The Best Stocks To Buy Right Now?,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stocks-buy-now-073148215.html,1690615908,STORY,"['^DJI', 'BRK-B', 'UBER', 'MSFT', 'TMO', 'UNH', 'PYPL', 'MA', 'BABA', 'ATVI', 'V']","[In this piece, we will take a look at what are the best stocks to buy right now. If you want to skip our primer on the stock market and the economy, then head on over to What Are The Best Stocks To Buy Right Now? Top 5 Stocks. When it comes to the turmoil in the U.S. economy that kicked off with the coronavirus pandemic and was extended due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, July 2023 has been the climaxing month. The start of the month saw investors wait with bated breaths about a crucial jobs report that would have provided the first signal about the Federal Reserve's plans for future interest rate hikes. While the central bank had nearly penciled in a 25 basis point interest rate increase for July, the concern surrounded future decisions, especially for the next meeting in September. The month started off with rather shocking private payrolls report that nearly took the wind out of the rally in the first half of 2023, as the data showed that more than twice the number of jobs were added than analysts were actually expecting.This shock was followed by new jobs data from the Labor Department that actually undershot expectations and provided a breather to analysts and investors. Then, inflation for June also saw a cooling off and led to the annual figure sitting at 3% and ending up being below the Dow Jones consensus estimates of 3.1%. However, more drama was in store for investors as July's final week settled in. This was in the form of two additional data sets that enabled an understanding of how far the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have made it into the economy and whether there is any justification for the Fed to even consider raising rates in September or later.The first data set was the GDP growth report from the Commerce Department. This report, like several others before it, provided a conflicting set of conclusions. On a positive note, it showed that the American economy grew by 2.4% in the second quarter with the growth accelerating from 2% in the first quarter. It added that price indexes also grew at a slower pace, lending credence to the belief that no further hikes might be required since inflation is cooling. The second quarter GDP growth data was met by another data release again from the Commerce Department. This was the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index which is also the Fed's favorite inflation tool. Prior to the release, economists were expecting the core PCE to sit at 4.2% annually and 0.3% over the month, and the data met these estimates. The pure PCE, namely prices that also include food and energy, stood at 3% in June, for the slowest pace in two years, and provided a lot of respite to jittery currency markets in particular as all major currencies gained against the U.S. dollar.Story continuesWhile the pure PCE is the Fed's favorite inflation metric, the central bank also monitors the labor and jobs market through several reports. One of these is the Employment Cost Index from the Labor Department. It revealed that civilian compensation costs in America rose by just 1% in Q2 2023 - for the slowest pace of increase since the second quarter of 2021. Annually, in June 2023, wages grew by 4.6% in June, slowing down from 5% in the first quarter. Combined, this data set shows that wage pressures are slowing down, and opens up hope for this trend to continue in the future to bring down inflation and not tip the economy into a recession.So, what's going on in the stock market now that the clouds finally might be disappearing? Well, the market, as you might know, has been on a tear this year. The NASDAQ 100 index closed Friday after gaining 1.85%, while the NASDAQ Composite, the S&amp;P500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) were up 1.90%, 0.99%, and 0.50%, respectively. This brings the year to date gains of the NASDAQ 100 to an exact 45% - and at a time when many had predicted that American economic output might be on the decline. As to whether this market optimism is warranted, Brent Schutte, the chief investment officer of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management believes that those that have made money on the market are done by now and the recent euphoria comes from folks who missed out on the fireworks during H1 2023.He simply put his sentiment as:Those same people who are probably piling in right now were wrong about their outlook nine months ago and now they’re reversing course. I’m pushing in the opposite direction. The equity market will have some difficult months ahead.So, in a market where most people are confused about what's really going on for months, the true question is which stocks should one buy.

Cannabis transactions are usually carried out with debit cards or cash.Although medical and recreational marijuana is legal in 38 states, retailers often find themselves left out of standard banking and payments processing systems because pot remains illegal at the federal level, according to MarketWatch.“Mastercard’s move is another blow to the payments industry and cannabis operators nationwide,” Justin Kahn, CEO and co-founder of Reepher, told Kiplinger.Many operators have been caught off guard“Its actions and the subsequent actions taken by the payments providers that serve the cannabis industry have caught many operators off guard. Operators have had their funds frozen and services turned off. It’s just another nail in the coffin of cannabis payments,” said Kahn, whose company offers the first behavior-based product with insurance coverage.The American Trade Association for Cannabis and Hemp as well as cannabis trade groups in 16 states and Washington, D.C. recently lobbied Senate leaders to pass the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act.The legislation, which was reintroduced in the House and Senate last April by a group of bipartisan lawmakers, is unlikely to move out of committee before Congress breaks for its August recess. It aims to enable cannabis businesses to access banking services by circumventing cash-only transactions that can expose businesses to public safety concerns, including robberies.Meanwhile, the 17th annual Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference take place on September 27-28 in Chicago.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now.Magic Formula investing strategy was first described by legendary value investor Joel Greenblatt in his 2005 book entitled The Little Book That Beats The Market. When Greenblatt says he has a formula that beats the market, the world listens, since he has an impeccable track record. Greenblatt’s hedge fund Gotham Capital posted compound annualized returns of over 34% from 1985 through 1994. The magic formula investing strategy was apparently too simple. According to this strategy investing in top-ranked large cap stocks with strong high earnings yield and a high return on invested capital (ROIC) beats the market.Magic Formula: Too Simple to be True?Joel Greenblatt was aware that this strategy sounded too good and simple to be true. That’s why in his book he repeatedly asks the reader the question that what is the guarantee, if any, that this magic formula investing strategy actually works and is not just a random fluke? After sharing a lot of historical data to prove how the magic formula investing strategy actually works over longer periods of time, Greenblatt begins to address the question about the timelessness of this strategy.“…In order for the magic formula to make us money in the long run, the principles behind it must appear not only sensible and logical, but timeless. Otherwise, there is no way we’ll be able to “hang on” when our short-term results turn against us. As simple as it may seem, knowing that two plus two always equals four can be a pretty powerful concept. No matter how many people tell us differently, no matter how long they tell us, and no matter how smart all those people appear to be, we are unlikely to waver in our conviction. In a similar way, our level of confidence in the magic formula will determine whether we can hang on to a strategy that may be both unpopular and unsuccessful for seemingly long periods of time.”Story continuesThe Link Between Return on Capital and Earnings GrowthGreenblatt then goes on to establish the link between high return on capital and earnings growth. He expands his concept of return on capital and says if a business is posting high return on capital and plans to invest all or major chunk of those returns to expand the same business, there’s a high chance that the business in question will keep growing its earnings. The magic formula investing strategy, Greenblatt emphasizes repeatedly, does not promote investing in companies with average return on capital let alone poor return on capital. The strategy makes a ranking system that looks for top companies with highest return on capital and earnings yield. This way, if a business has high return on capital and earnings yield that means the business has some kind of advantage over its competitors that it can maintain in the future as well.Joel Greenblatt repeatedly acknowledges that the magic formula investing strategy might not work in several instances and performs poorly in many situations especially when the holding period is short. He emphasizes the importance of holding stocks and why it’s easier said than done:“Most people just won’t wait that long. Their investment time horizon is too short. If a strategy works in the long run (meaning it sometimes takes three, four, or even five years to show its stuff), most people won’t stick with it. After a year or two of performing worse than the market averages (or earning lower returns than their friends), most people look for a new strategy— usually one that has done well over the past few years. Even professional money managers who believe their strategy will work over the long term have a hard time sticking with it. After a few years of poor performance relative to the market or to their competitors, the vast majority of clients and investors just leave! That’s why it’s hard to stay with a strategy that doesn’t follow along with everyone else’s.”Value underperformed for several years before it made a comeback with a vengeance when inflation, rate hikes and highly volatile geopolitical situation started to crush the global financial markets. While Joel Greenblatt has always been a fan of value investing, he’d already started to adapt a hybrid investing strategy to take up passive investing to make up for value underperformance. In a 2017 report, Bloomberg reported how Gotham Asset Management was inculcating index trading. The report at the time quoted Greenblatt who said:“It’s a hybrid that answers a lot of the questions that active management has failed to answer,” he said. “This strategy will dwarf them over time.”The Bloomberg report said that Greenblatt’s hedge fund introduced Gotham Index Plus in 2015. The intention behind this step was simple: instead of putting all capital in active management, put some in the S&amp;P 500 index and then invest in stocks they consider undervalued and short those they believe will fall.11 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy NowJoel Greenblatt of Gotham Asset ManagementOur MethodologyFor this article, we used Joel Greenblatt’s Q1’ 2023 portfolio and picked his top 11 stock holdings.Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now11.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Recession-Proof Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.Latest data on inflation has upped the hopes of investors as market naysayers who had been warning of recession for several months are on the back foot now. Since inflation is still high and far above the Federal Reserve’s target, many still believe we can see a moderate recession in the coming months. But now there are many ifs and buts before such recession calls. For example, in June, talking to Bloomberg, Newedge Wealth's Cameron Dawson said that she expects a 350-point drop in the S&amp;P 500 in the next six months. She said the recession expectations could be “realistic” if you “start to see the whites of the eyes of a recession showing up."" But she also said that if earnings continue to show resiliency “then maybe that doesn't look like something that's in the cards.""Similarly, Tony Crescenzi, executive VP at investment management firm Pimco, said that he believes the US is already in a “growth recession.” Simply put, according to Crescenzi, growth recession is when the economy is not growing at its true potential and demand is lower than supply.He believes the US has the potential for an annual growth of 1.8% but he believes currently the growth is below that. However, there’s a silver lining here. Crescenzi thinks this growth recession would give supply a chance to catchup with demand. When the gap between supply and demand will narrow, the Federal Reserve won’t need to keep increasing interest rates.“The Fed could say we needn't raise interest rates any more, and if supply catches up enough, in a growth recession it can happen, then eventually there are interest-rate cuts,” Crescenzi said, in an interview with Bloomberg.In its Q3 outlook report, American Century Investments said that it takes time for monetary policy actions to show their real effects. The report said that while the economy is still strong and unemployment is low, there are areas that are slowing as the firm said it believes “ a recession awaits us down the road.” American Century said that it isn’t alone in its skepticism of policymakers’ ability to control inflation without triggering a recession. The report quoted former Fed economist Claudia Sahm who said that a recession was expected for a long time but  “we’re finally getting to the moment of truth.”Story continuesThe report also quoted American Century’s interview with former Kansas City Fed President Esther George who thinks that while the Fed’s intention is obviously not to trigger a recession, in case we experience a recession, it would not be the first time rate hikes have triggered one.American Century Investments also said that in light of expectations that inflation is here to stay, investors should protect their portfolios from inflation. And for that they should look for solid companies. Here’s what the report said:“Against a recessionary backdrop, we think equity style distinctions are less important. We’re emphasizing quality instead. This means we’re focusing more on companies with stable revenues, repeatable profits, low indebtedness, stable cash flows and predictable business models less sensitive to economic conditions.”However, the report does not paint all doom and gloom. It also said that in the second half of 2023 earnings are expected to remain strong amid lowering inventory of semiconductors and increasing economic activity in China and Asia.The report further highlights that while the markets rallied earlier this year, there is a lot of optimism among investors that the Federal Reserve might start cutting rates down the road. American Century believes this is not a correct presumption. The report said that investors should continue to invest in businesses that are positioned to gain in the long term instead of focusing on short-term, assumption-based dynamics of the market.Wells Fargo also published its mid-year outlook 2023 report in June. Wells Fargo said that the bear markets of 2022 and 2023 are expected to evolve into recession in the back half of 2023 or early 2024. Wells Fargo said that this would be the most predicted and longest anticipated recession. Wells Fargo said that economic cycles are natural and what’s important for investors is to position their portfolios accordingly.“Our guidance — to remain defensive in portfolio positioning — has remained consistent through this period, and we reiterate that guidance in our 2023 Midyear Outlook.”Wells Fargo also believes that after 2023 recession earnings will expand in 2024 and valuations will rebound. The bank said in its report that investors should prefer quality stocks, which have “sound balance sheets, strong levels of profitability and cash flow, the ability to generate consistent growth, and earnings stability.”“As is typical, equity prices likely will increase at a much more rapid pace than earnings can recover, leading to price/earnings (P/E) multiple spikes and above-average valuations in 2024. However, once the earnings recovery catches up to the price recovery during the back half of next year, we expect multiples to revert to average levels. The following chart illustrates how our view of earnings and multiple expansion could combine to drive returns this year and next, and how this expected interplay relates to history. It shows calendar-year contributions to return for the S&amp;P 500 Index from 2007 to 2022 as well as our forecasts for 2023 and 2024.”Recession-Proof Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnOur MethodologyBillionaires have also been anticipating a recession and it’s always interesting to see how they are positioning their portfolios according to market environment. For this article we first scanned and listed all stock holdings of the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund (VIG), which is considered among the top defensive ETFs investors prefer during recessionary environments. For each stock holding of the ETF, we looked for the number of billionaires having stakes in them using Insider Monkey’s comprehensive data of billionaire-owned stocks. We then picked 10 of these stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.Recession-Proof Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On10. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Billionaire Investors: 18With six decades of consistent dividend increases under its belt and long-term growth catalysts, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) remains one of the safest stocks to buy for both recession and normal market environments.Morgan Stanley last month made some changes to its global dividend portfolio. However, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) continues to feature in the portfolio.A total of 17 billionaire-led hedge funds were bullish on Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. Among these billionaires include Ray Dalio, DE Shaw, Donald Yacktman and Cliff Asness. Overall, out of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 86 hedge funds had stakes in Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“The tech-dominated quarter was a headwind for both defensive and cyclical sectors, with shares of health care holdings such as UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Elevance (ELV) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) declining after a strong 2022.”9. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Billionaire Investors: 18Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) has increased its dividend for over six decades now. It ranks 9th in our list of the best recession-proof stocks billionaires are loading up on. Insider Monkey’s database of billionaire-owned stocks shows that 18 billionaires were long Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.In May,  Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating after Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)’s strong quarterly results and guidance. Morgan Stanley’s analyst Dara Mohsenian and his team believe there’s an upside to Colgate EPS, FX, organic sales, and gross margins in 2023.Morgan Stanley also upped its price target on Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) shares to $89 from $82.Among the notable billionaires having stakes in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) include D. E. Shaw, Dan Loeb, Ray Dalio and Cliff Asness.Third Point Management made the following comment about Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Existing positions in LVMH, Disney and Microsoft gained while FIS, Bath &amp; Body Works, and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) posted losses after their management teams lowered 2023 guidance despite reporting solid quarterly results. FIS and Colgate have both since “beat and raised” this guidance, indicating that many management teams are adopting very conservative tones in this uncertain macro environment.”8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Billionaire Investors: 18Hardly any list of best defensive stocks for recessions is written without mentioning The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), which has upped its dividends consistently for six decades and which has several billionaire stakeholders. The most important of these billionaires is Warren Buffett, whose hedge fund owns a $25 billion stake in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).7. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Billionaire Investors: 18A total of 18 billionaires in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as of the end of the first quarter. The most prominent of them was of course Warren Buffett whose hedge fund had a whopping $151 billion stake in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors rejoiced at the company’s surpassing of $3 trillion valuation in June. While Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s valuation has fallen below the $3 trillion market as of July 13, analysts are highly bullish on the future prospects of Apple. Last month, Citi analyst Atif Malik said in a note that analysts were underestimating Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s gross margin expansion. Malik said that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was gaining market share from Android and benefitting from the blend of iPhone Pro and Pro Max models. Malik started covering Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a Buy rating and a $240 price target.6. Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV)Number of Billionaire Investors: 19Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) ranks 6th in our list of the best recession-proof stocks to buy according to billionaires. Because Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) is operating in a recession-proof industry and pays dividends, it saw an increased interest from investors earlier this year when recession risks surged. Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds shows that 81 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) as of the end of the first quarter, up from 75 funds in the previous quarter.The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) during this period was billionaire Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global which owns a $991 million stake in the company.Madison Investors Fund made the following comment about Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We purchased Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) and trimmed Marsh &amp; McLennan and Arch Capital. Elevance is the largest for-profit Blue Cross Blue Shield plan in the country, supporting the largest domestic membership base across the managed care industry. While national scale is important, local scale is critical as well, given the localized nature of healthcare delivery. Elevance scores well on both fronts, giving it strong bargaining power with providers, lower customer acquisition costs, deep population health data and analytics, and the ability to offer attractive health benefit packages. All this combines to create a formidable moat for its business.We also believe the management team is top-notch. Since joining Elevance from a senior leadership position at peer UnitedHealth Group, CEO Gail Boudreaux has further leveraged the company’s scale advantage by expanding its internal healthcare services capabilities through a newly formed business unit called Carelon. As the industry transitions to a reimbursement system that emphasizes patient outcomes over procedure or testing volume, data analytics will be a crucial tool in managing patient care. Carelon has become the repository for many of these data analytics and healthcare service capabilities, and it should be an attractive growth platform for many years to come. Concerns around a possible slowdown in government-sponsored programs in Medicare Advantage and managed Medicaid gave us an opportunity to invest at a good price.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Recession-Proof Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.   Suggested articles:10 Best One Dollar Stocks to Buy Now20 Highest Paid Hedge Fund Managers of All Time20 High-Paying Dream Jobs You Didn’t Know ExistedDisclosure: None. 10 Recession-Proof Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

That resilience is about to be put to the test.A US bankruptcy court is expected to rule by Aug. 2 for the second time on whether the healthcare conglomerate can use a controversial bankruptcy strategy to dispose of roughly 100,000 claims.The company is now offering a settlement of $8.9 billion, more than four times its offer in 2021, as it continues to negotiate with claimants and their lawyers.Some claimants don’t want the settlement and accuse the company of ""manufacturing"" financial distress to protect its assets.The company claims most support it. In fact, J&amp;J global head of litigation Erik Haas told analysts on July 20 that 60,000 claimants were in favor while 40,000 were opposed.Johnson &amp; Johnson's baby powder on a supermarket shelf in 2017. (FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images) (AFP Contributor via Getty Images)""The numbers right now show that the vast majority of claimants support the proposed plan,"" Haas said.The numbers cited last week by J&amp;J were below the 75% of claimants that, by law, must approve the proposal for a bankruptcy court to grant it. The company previously told analysts it could meet that threshold.'Lingering uncertainties'Analysts say the current settlement proposal of $8.9 billion shouldn't significantly impact the multibillion-dollar company, if it wins approval.But a denial would mean J&amp;J would have to defend itself on a case-by-case basis in the courts, which would potentially be an expensive and time-consuming proposition that would likely hang over the company for years.The litigation presents ""lingering uncertainties"" for J&amp;J, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note last week after the company reported its second quarter earnings.""Should the bankruptcy not proceed, then cases will be decided by the tort system, which could prolong timelines for this issue to achieve visible resolution.""Story continuesJPMorgan Chase analysts in a separate note after J&amp;J earnings last week said the talc settlement progress was ""one of the most important drivers"" of the company's stock in 2023.""There remains a fairly high level of skepticism on both the validity of the bankruptcy structure as well as the ability to get enough of the remaining plaintiffs to agree to the proposed terms,"" the analysts wrote.Individual talc cases that have been decided by a judge or jury have resulted in big awards for plaintiffs.A California jury earlier this month ruled J&amp;J had to pay $18.8 million to a man who said talc caused cancer in tissue surrounding his heart. In two prior cases it was ordered to pay $120 million to a Brooklyn, N.Y. couple and $2.21 billion to a group of women in Missouri.The company is appealing two of these cases and planning to appeal the third. J&amp;J denies that its discontinued talc-based powder ever caused harm.In 2020, it settled 1,000 talc claims for $100 million. The following year it prevailed in an Illinois case alleging $50 million in damages.The Texas two stepJ&amp;J has so far dealt with the risk using a controversial strategy known as the ""Texas Two-Step.""The tactic taps the US bankruptcy system to wall off company assets from costly litigation. The measure was put to the test when a three-judge panel for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals denied J&amp;J’s first attempt.Critics argue that the strategy subverts the bankruptcy process by making its protections available to solvent companies.The first step began in October 2021 when Johnson &amp; Johnson’s parent company formed the subsidiary LTL Management, transferring its existing 38,000 talc claims to LTL. At the time, J&amp;J offered $2 billion to fund LTL to cover the outstanding claims.Two days later came the second step. LTL filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a federal court in North Carolina, triggering an automatic stay that protected J&amp;J's assets from judgments reached and claims filed prior to the bankruptcy.The matter was later transferred to a federal bankruptcy court in Trenton, N.J., where in February 2022 US bankruptcy judge Michael Kaplan approved LTL's bankruptcy petition. He also approved the request of talc claimants to fast-track an appeal of his decision to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.Nearly a year later in January, the appellate court unanimously overruled Kaplan, dismissing LTL's petition and concluding that the single-purpose entity sought out bankruptcy for an invalid purpose.A person walks by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia. (Andrew Kelly/REUTERS) (Andrew Kelly / reuters)According to the panel, LTL wasn’t financially distressed — a condition required for bankruptcy — because an agreement with J&amp;J gave it access to at least $61.5 billion to manage and settle talc claims.To get around the Third Circuit's sticking point, J&amp;J then amended LTL's financing agreements, boosted its settlement proposal to $8.9 billion, and re-petitioned LTL for bankruptcy. It also did away with LTL's access to the $61.5 billion.The move triggered another stay, and another request from talc litigants to disallow LTL's bankruptcy. This is what Kaplan, the US bankruptcy court judge, will again be asked to consider.If the case goes forward, there will be an Aug. 22 court hearing on LTL's request to approve its revised reorganization plan. On Monday, the US Trustee, an arm of the Justice Department tasked with preserving integrity of bankruptcy proceedings, objected to that request.The Trustee, which also objects to LTL’s second attempt at bankruptcy, said LTL prematurely solicited its creditors to vote on the arrangement, given that the court rulings on whether the bankruptcy is valid could make the matter moot.A 'de minimus' impactIf J&amp;J is allowed to deal with its claims in bankruptcy court for $8.9 billion, a settlement would likely have a ""de minimus"" impact on its bottom line, SVB Securities analysts said in April.That's because of potential insurance covering the talc liabilities and tax deductions that help offset settlement costs, according to SVB analysts.""We estimate the amount net of taxes"" would be $7.1 billion ""and this is before potential partial insurance coverage. J&amp;J expects that there will be some insurance coverage, although there are ongoing disputes with insurers on this topic.""J&amp;J declined to comment on the existence or extent of insurance covering its talc claims.Up until 2005, it carried third-party liability insurance that could potentially cover litigation and settlement expenses. In later years, J&amp;J self-insured against product liability claims through its Vermont subsidiary, Middlesex Assurance Company.Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

123,ee8c9fd2-5765-3a86-85c1-6d6246ea25be,JNJ,2023-07-29,Dorian and Oxford Industries have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dorian-oxford-industries-highlighted-zacks-143100515.html,1690554660,STORY,"['OXM', 'JNJ', 'WMT', 'LPG']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – July 28, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Dorian LPG as the Bull of the Day and Oxford Industries OXM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM, Walmart Inc. WMT and Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Dorian is a Zacks Rank #1 (Buy) and it sports a B for Value and a C for Growth. This stock is undervalued compared to its peers and also has a large dividend coming up.  The company ships liquid natural gas and has moved steadily higher over the last few months.  Let's explore more about this company in this Bull of The Day article.DescriptionDorian LPG Ltd., together with its subsidiaries, engages in the transportation of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) through its LPG tankers worldwide. It owns and operates twenty-five very large gas carriers (VLGCs). The company was incorporated in 2013 and is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number.  This tells me right away where the market's expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market.  A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved.  That is what you want to see.For Dorian, I see one beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and two misses over the last calendar year.  That is great to see, but by itself that is not enough to make the company a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Earnings Estimates RevisionsThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher.Over the last 30 days, earning estimates have increased for LPG.There are no quarterly estimates in the Zacks Research System.The full year numbers are certainly more important... and they are moving higher.Story continuesThis year has moved from $3.81 to $4.86.Next year is now at $2.37 move up from $2.35.ValuationThe valuation is great here trading at 5.7x forward estimates with the industry average coming in at 17x. Price to book of 1.3x is also well below the 4.6x industry average. Price to sales is at 2.9x and that again is below the 5x industry average.I see operating margins moving from 34% to 43% so there was a huge move there and that is great to see.This looks like a very mispriced asset that is going to benefit from sector rotation back into energy.Bear of the Day:Oxford Industries is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) has seen earnings estimates slide lower recently despite the fact that it has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. This article will look at why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as it is the Bear of the Day.DescriptionOxford Industries, Inc., an apparel company, designs, sources, markets, and distributes products of lifestyle and other brands worldwide. As of January 29, 2022, it operated 186 brand-specific full-price retail stores; 21 Tommy Bahama food and beverage locations; and 35 Tommy Bahama outlet stores. Oxford Industries, Inc. was founded in 1942 and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number.  This tells me right away where the market's expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market.  A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved.  That is what you want to see.In the case of OXM, I see four straight beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn't make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.The Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.Earnings EstimatesThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower. For OXM I see annual estimates moving lower of late.The current fiscal year consensus number moved lower from $11.79 to $11.05 over the last 60 days.The next year has moved from $12.66 to $11.83 over the last 60 days.Negative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).It should be noted that a lot of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions. That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Additional content:3 Top Blue Chip Stocks to Ride the Dow RallyThe Dow is experiencing a fantastic July, with the blue-chip index extending a winning streak not seen in decades, thanks to upbeat corporate earnings and the possibility of a pause in rate hikes soon.It, thus, makes sense to place bets on solid blue-chip players like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Walmart Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson that can make the most of a Dow rally.Dow Seals Longest Winning Streak in 36 YearsAfter a volatile trading session on Jul 26, the Dow was able to clinch its longest winning streak since Jan 20, 1987, per Dow Jones Market Data. The 30-stock blue-chip index scaled upward by 82.05 points, or 0.23%, to register its 13th consecutive trading session in the green.The Dow's latest milestone is now registered in the history books, and if the blue-chip gauge extends its winning streak for another trading session, it will notch its longest daily winning streak since June 1897, which was one year after the index was created in May 1896.Corporate Profits Are ImprovingThe Dow was able to hold onto its positive momentum as the latest corporate quarterly earnings results were mostly encouraging for the blue-chip stocks.3M Company's shares moved northward after the company reported second-quarter earnings beat. Similarly, The Coca-Cola Company's shares moved up on promising earnings results for the quarter that ended in June and a positive outlook for the rest of 2023.The Boeing Company's shares also soared after the company's free cash flow in the second quarter improved following an uptick in commercial aircraft deliveries.Fed Raises Rates But Could Pause AgainMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve increased its interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point as prices of indispensable commodities remain above the central bank's target of 2%.The Fed has hiked interest rates in 11 of its last 12 meetings, and now the benchmark overnight interest rates are 5.25-5.50%, the highest level in more than 22 years.However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell did indicate that interest rate hikes may be paused shortly, as was done in the June meeting. The Fed remains data-driven, and the central bank may choose to hold rates steady in the September meeting.Market pundits are also betting on a rate hike pause in September. Almost 77.2% of them are expecting the Fed to pause rate hikes in the next meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool.Thus, chances of pausing rate hikes boosted investors' sentiment and helped the Dow scale upward as well. After all, rate hikes impact consumer outlays, increase borrowing costs and hamper economic activities.3 Best Blue Chip Stocks for a Winning PortfolioBanking on such hopefulness, there will be a sharp run-up in the index of 30 stocks. The companies on the index are slated to advance further in the near term as they have large market capitalization, solid balance sheets, and steady cash flow.We have, thus, selected three such blue-chip stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.JPMorgan is one of the biggest global banks. Now, a possible rate hike pause may not bode well for the bank, but its strong liquidity position and recent strategic acquisitions should certainly help it chug along in the near term.JPMorgan has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for JPM's current-year earnings has moved up 7.9% over the past 60 days. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 25.8%. JPM's estimated earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 5%.Walmart is now an omnichannel player and not just a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer. The company's impressive comp sales are driving growth, while its e-commerce business is expanding.Walmart has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WMT's current-year earnings has moved up 0.3% over the past 60 days. The company's expected earnings growth rate for next year is 10.5%. WMT's estimated earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 5.5%.Johnson &amp; Johnson operates through pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer products divisions. While its MedTech division is enjoying strong fundamentals, the company remains engaged in expanding the labels of some of its marketed products.Johnson &amp; Johnson has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for JNJ's current-year earnings has moved up 0.7% over the past 60 days. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 5.7%. JNJ's estimated earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 5.5%.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now.Magic Formula investing strategy was first described by legendary value investor Joel Greenblatt in his 2005 book entitled The Little Book That Beats The Market. When Greenblatt says he has a formula that beats the market, the world listens, since he has an impeccable track record. Greenblatt’s hedge fund Gotham Capital posted compound annualized returns of over 34% from 1985 through 1994. The magic formula investing strategy was apparently too simple. According to this strategy investing in top-ranked large cap stocks with strong high earnings yield and a high return on invested capital (ROIC) beats the market.Magic Formula: Too Simple to be True?Joel Greenblatt was aware that this strategy sounded too good and simple to be true. That’s why in his book he repeatedly asks the reader the question that what is the guarantee, if any, that this magic formula investing strategy actually works and is not just a random fluke? After sharing a lot of historical data to prove how the magic formula investing strategy actually works over longer periods of time, Greenblatt begins to address the question about the timelessness of this strategy.“…In order for the magic formula to make us money in the long run, the principles behind it must appear not only sensible and logical, but timeless. Otherwise, there is no way we’ll be able to “hang on” when our short-term results turn against us. As simple as it may seem, knowing that two plus two always equals four can be a pretty powerful concept. No matter how many people tell us differently, no matter how long they tell us, and no matter how smart all those people appear to be, we are unlikely to waver in our conviction. In a similar way, our level of confidence in the magic formula will determine whether we can hang on to a strategy that may be both unpopular and unsuccessful for seemingly long periods of time.”Story continuesThe Link Between Return on Capital and Earnings GrowthGreenblatt then goes on to establish the link between high return on capital and earnings growth. He expands his concept of return on capital and says if a business is posting high return on capital and plans to invest all or major chunk of those returns to expand the same business, there’s a high chance that the business in question will keep growing its earnings. The magic formula investing strategy, Greenblatt emphasizes repeatedly, does not promote investing in companies with average return on capital let alone poor return on capital. The strategy makes a ranking system that looks for top companies with highest return on capital and earnings yield. This way, if a business has high return on capital and earnings yield that means the business has some kind of advantage over its competitors that it can maintain in the future as well.Joel Greenblatt repeatedly acknowledges that the magic formula investing strategy might not work in several instances and performs poorly in many situations especially when the holding period is short. He emphasizes the importance of holding stocks and why it’s easier said than done:“Most people just won’t wait that long. Their investment time horizon is too short. If a strategy works in the long run (meaning it sometimes takes three, four, or even five years to show its stuff), most people won’t stick with it. After a year or two of performing worse than the market averages (or earning lower returns than their friends), most people look for a new strategy— usually one that has done well over the past few years. Even professional money managers who believe their strategy will work over the long term have a hard time sticking with it. After a few years of poor performance relative to the market or to their competitors, the vast majority of clients and investors just leave! That’s why it’s hard to stay with a strategy that doesn’t follow along with everyone else’s.”Value underperformed for several years before it made a comeback with a vengeance when inflation, rate hikes and highly volatile geopolitical situation started to crush the global financial markets. While Joel Greenblatt has always been a fan of value investing, he’d already started to adapt a hybrid investing strategy to take up passive investing to make up for value underperformance. In a 2017 report, Bloomberg reported how Gotham Asset Management was inculcating index trading. The report at the time quoted Greenblatt who said:“It’s a hybrid that answers a lot of the questions that active management has failed to answer,” he said. “This strategy will dwarf them over time.”The Bloomberg report said that Greenblatt’s hedge fund introduced Gotham Index Plus in 2015. The intention behind this step was simple: instead of putting all capital in active management, put some in the S&amp;P 500 index and then invest in stocks they consider undervalued and short those they believe will fall.11 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy NowJoel Greenblatt of Gotham Asset ManagementOur MethodologyFor this article, we used Joel Greenblatt’s Q1’ 2023 portfolio and picked his top 11 stock holdings.Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now11.

125,1f5c92cd-f0ca-3bf0-8e7c-eabc3ca41fde,MRK,2023-07-29,"Drugmakers go under the skin, skirting early US Medicare price negotiations",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drugmakers-under-skin-skirting-early-101454743.html,1690539294,STORY,"['JNJ', 'MRK', 'HALO']","[By Michael ErmanNEW YORK (Reuters) - Injectable versions of some widely-used cancer drugs including Johnson &amp; Johnson's blockbuster multiple myeloma treatment Darzalex are likely to be excluded from new U.S. government price negotiations for years, drugmakers told Reuters, protecting billions in revenue.Whether the government agrees that adding an ingredient enabling infused drugs to be given by injection will allow them to be considered new medicines and significantly delay eligibility for price negotiations is being closely watched by Wall Street and the drugmakers.J&amp;J, Merck &amp; Co, which is testing an injectable version of its top-selling immunotherapy Keytruda, and Halozyme Therapeutics, which licenses the critical new ingredient, hyaluronidase, for subcutaneous drugs, all told Reuters they believe the reformulation qualifies the medicines to be treated like new drugs.Bristol Myers Squibb and Roche, which are developing versions for under the skin injection of cancer immunotherapies Opdivo and Tecentriq, respectively, said it was too soon to say.President Biden’s signature Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allows the government Medicare health program for the first time to negotiate prices for some of its most costly drugs, starting at a minimum discount of 25% to a drug's price. It aims to create $25 billion in annual savings by 2031 for a country that pays more for prescription medicines than any other.Medicare, which serves Americans age 65 and older, is working on selecting 10 drugs for the first wave of negotiation on prices that would go into effect in 2026. They will be selected from medicines that have been on the market at least nine years - 13 years for more complex biotech drugs - without what the agency sees as ample direct competition.Each year, Medicare will add more drugs to the list, the names of which have not yet been disclosed. In 2028, it will start negotiating on drugs that are typically given in a hospital setting like these.Story continuesThe U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, which runs the Medicare program for more than 60 million Americans, declined to comment on whether it will consider older medicines that add hyaluronidase as new.Evercore ISI biotech analyst Michael DiFiore said he expects Medicare to do so because hyaluronidase is an active ingredient that allows the body to absorb more of the drug when it is injected.""That is unique specialized technology,"" DiFiore said.When Medicare issued guidelines for negotiations earlier this year, it closed many loopholes that could have allowed drugmakers to game the system by making small changes to their drugs. Going from an immediate release to an extended release formulation would be one example of this, he said.Injectable cancer treatments that include hyaluronidase are not that in that category, DiFiore said.BILLIONS AT STAKEJ&amp;J Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk, in an interview last week, said he does not expect the subcutaneous version of Darzalex, called Darzalex Faspro, to be eligible for negotiation until 2033 or 2034.That could be five or more years beyond Darzalex, which will have been on the market for 13 years in 2028. Faspro, launched in 2020, already accounts for more than 80% of Darzalex revenue, which is due to rise to $9.5 billion this year.Merck has said it hopes to launch its Keytruda injectable within a few years, with approval starting the 13-year clock until negotiation eligibility. The infused version of Keytruda could be subject to the program as soon as 2028.Merck previously told Reuters it expects this version of Keytruda could replace the more time consuming infusion for most patients. Keytruda revenue is expected to top $24 billion this year and could exceed $30 billion as soon as 2026, according to analyst estimates.San Diego-based Halozyme had $660 million in 2022 revenue. The company has said its expects revenue from subcutaneous drugs containing hyaluronidase to drive its growth going forward.CEO Helen Torley said in Halozyme's opinion, Medicare has made its view on what defines separate drugs “very, very clear,” and that these injectables made with hyaluronidase will be treated as a new drug.(Reporting by Michael Erman; Additional reporting by Patrick Wingrove; Editing by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot)]"

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Aaron Astrachan. Please go ahead, sir.Aaron AstrachanGood morning, and thank you for joining Moog's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Aaron Astrachan, Director of Investor Relations. With me today is Pat Roche, Chief Executive Officer; and Jennifer Walter, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we released our results and our supplemental financial schedules, both of which are available on our website. Our earnings press release, our supplemental financial schedules and remarks made during our call today contain adjusted non-GAAP results. Reconciliations for these adjusted results to GAAP results are contained within the provided materials.

These are not guarantees as our actual results may differ materially from those described in our forward-looking statements and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings press release and in our other SEC filings. Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Pat.Patrick J. RocheGood morning, and welcome. Today, we will share our update on a quarter notable for record sales, strong underlying operating performance improvement masked by a space vehicle charge and cash demands above expectation. We are also increasing our full year earnings per share guidance while reflecting this stronger demand on cash.It's almost 2 months since our Investor Day conference in New York City. Our team was delighted to have the opportunity to make public our business plans. For the first time, we were explicit on our goals for the business, namely revenue CAGR of 5% to 7% to fiscal '26 from our '22 baseline, average annual adjusted operating margin expansion of 100 basis points to fiscal '26, adjusted earnings per share CAGR of 15% to 20% to 26% and free cash flow returning to the 75% to 100% conversion by '25, '26.We took the time in New York City to explain how we are going to deliver on these significant improvements in performance and talked in detail about our simplification and pricing activities that deliver margin enhancement. During today's call, I will give several specific examples of such activity within the quarter. Two months ago, 2 months on, I remain confident that we have a great business that is growing and becoming more profitable over the next few years.Let me start right away with an update on our operational performance, covering each of my 3 themes. Starting with customer focus. We delivered record sales while managing the ongoing challenges of supply chain and labor availability. These challenges have an impact on inventory holding, product flow and overall efficiency. Our enhanced maintenance, repair and overhaul service was recognized by both Boeing and Airbus, achieving a top 2 ranking with Boeing. We continue to simplify how we're organized. We have made internal reporting structure changes within our $330 million space business that empower business leaders to better meet operational needs of our customers and to achieve financial performance.Secondly, people, community and planet, our Baguio site, which is core to our commercial aircraft operations was recognized by the employers confederation of the Philippines for our commitment to operational excellence, sustainability, employee relations and ethical behavior. We are thankful that our people are safe following this week's super typhoon.And finally, let me return to financial strength. We are relentlessly driving simplification and pricing across our business. Let me share some examples. Within Industrial Systems, we continue to refine our portfolio with the launch of a sales process for our business in Luxembourg. For context, this is a $15 million revenue operation with 70 staff manufacturing cartridge valves and manifolds. We are refining our footprint with several moves. For example, we've changed from a direct channel to market in South Africa to a distributor model exiting our leased facility.In aircraft controls, we have announced the closure of the Cincinnati-based operation of SureFly and its transfer to our Genesis Aerosystems facility in Texas. While each change yields relatively small impact today, it is the accumulation of these changes over the next couple of years that delivers footprint benefit. We are seeing 80/20 gain further traction within our business. We have the data analytics on profitability complete for over 2/3 of our revenue base across the entire organization.We have trained well over 100 leaders on the 80/20 approach, and we are growing capability as pilot sites mature the process and expand scope from profitability analysis to include reduction of cash conversion cycle. Ultimately, 80/20 is accelerating decisions that increase our profitability. For example, we have identified several product lines that we feel are at end of life, and we are either working with customers to close our production or finalizing agreements with other companies who will continue to support the products.Now let me turn my attention to pricing. We are driving pricing activity across all markets that we serve. We have a systematic approach, pursuing high-impact opportunities early and using 80/20 to focus further margin enhancement. Our philosophy is to ensure that pricing reflects the value that we deliver. Aircraft Control has made very significant margin improvements through pricing that are now reflected in our full year forecast. In addition, Industrial Systems has delivered substantial operating margin enhancement in this quarter with pricing being the most important contributor. Across all businesses, pricing is driving margin enhancement.Now let me turn to the macro economy. The Department of Defense budget for fiscal '24 is still on its way through the House and Senate, the requested increase of 3.2% is looking to protect new platforms. Significantly, this includes maintaining the future vertical lift funding stream, moving next-generation air dominance aircraft and collaborative combat aircraft to programs of record in 2024 and increasing to $30 billion to funding for the space force.Unfortunately, the war in Ukraine has now stretched beyond 500 days. politically, the obstacles to Sweden's accession to NATO has been overcome and ratification by Turkish and Hungarian Parliament is anticipated. The significant demands of arming Ukraine is driving missile replenishment orders and increased equipment MRO activity. According to Lockheed Martin, the fleet of F-35 fighters operating in Europe is expected to increase fourfold by 2030.U.S.-China tensions continue with the trade dispute of our semiconductors now extending the cloud computing and precious minerals. It appears that important diplomatic efforts continue with Antony Blinken,Janet Yellen, Henry Kissinger and John Kerry all visiting China in recent weeks. Whilst the slowdown in Chinese economic activity is a minor concern, escalating trade embargoes would be a greater concern and potentially more disruptive. Our philosophy remains to be in China for China.The recovery of commercial aircraft continues. Consequently, we are seeing real strength in aftermarket. And consistent with Investor Day, Boeing and Airbus continue to project a doubling of rates in wide-body production by fiscal '26.Industrial Automation remains a watch item. The June purchaser Managers Index for manufacturing shows contraction in the U.S. and for 12 straight months in the Eurozone. Our order intake for Industrial Automation is down about 4% in the last 6 months relative to the prior 6 months. However, we have a healthy backlog carrying us into fiscal 2024.Now turning to what was notable in the quarter. We returned to the Paris Air Show after 4 years absence. It was a remarkable show in which the sentiment was extremely positive. Both commercial aerospace and defense markets are anticipating continued strong growth. In fact, record-breaking gross orders for 1,000 aircraft were placed with OEMs in the month of June. There was quite a notable presence of EV tolls at the show, and we're pleased to supply hardware so far on 2 of these aircraft. In May, the C919 entered revenue service with China Eastern. This is a significant step for COMAC. We are planning a handful of shipments in calendar year '23 and a gradual increase through calendar year '24.As noted at Investor Day, the engineering and manufacturing development phase of V-280 started in June. We are making good progress in ramping our engineering team. It was notable that Collins Aerospace was sold by RTX to Safran. Given no new commercial platform development over the next decade, the sale does not, in our opinion, change the competitive landscape for flight control systems.Now turning attention to our financial performance. Our second consecutive quarter of record sales was a great achievement for our entire staff. We are starting to see the benefits of simplification and pricing feeding through in our operational performance. We delivered sales of $850 million, up over 10% on prior year, with every segment posting double-digit organic growth. We are seeing the recovery of commercial aircraft, reconfigurable integrated weapons platform at full rate and high levels of activity in space components, industrial automation and simulation.Our bookings remained strong overall with 12-month backlog at $2.3 billion, up 2% over prior year. We do see some softening within Industrial Automation, as noted earlier. Our adjusted operating margin was down 30 basis points on prior year. Excluding space vehicle charges, our margin performance would have been up 120 basis points. This margin enhancement is due to pricing and business growth. Our cash flow was clearly pressured in this quarter with a $19 million use of cash arising from growth of physical inventory.Before I hand over to Jennifer, I'd like to expand on my view of the 2 key issues impacting performance in this quarter and for the full year, namely space vehicle charges and cash flow. Firstly, we incurred a $14 million charge on our space vehicle fixed price contracts. You may ask, since we were 90% complete on our last call, how further charge could arise.The charge is driven by 2 factors, namely additional software development efforts required to resolve all remaining open issues necessary to achieve flight-ready software and additional integration and test effort required to rework issues arising at integration of the last couple of flight units. These are complex systems in which the final stages of integration can flush out on anticipated challenges. Despite incurring year-to-date charges of $25 million in space vehicles, I remain very confident in that business. These charges represent additional investment in gaining a much deeper understanding of satellite bus system integration and building our capability to deliver.Our achievements to date include the development of 2 spacecraft bus platforms, namely Meteorite and Meteor, which weigh 120 kgs and 650 kgs, respectively. These buses share many common components, in particular, the avionics unit and the software base. We have now fully built and tested 6 payload ready meteorite class satellites, and we have shipped all flight hardware required under 2 contracts as of last week. We will deliver the final software release within the next 2 weeks.From my perspective, we have a great offering with 2 satellite bus platforms that can carry a variety of customer payloads. We are operating in a rapidly expanding market and see plenty of new opportunities ahead. Our execution risk is reduced due to our improved capability and the commonality of hardware and software across both the Meteorite and Meteor platforms.Now turning my attention to our cash situation. We adjusted our free cash flow guidance from 0 to minus $60 million for FY '23. Let me describe what has changed. First, our sales have come in much stronger than anticipated. We also believe 90 days ago that there would be less growth in physical inventory during the second half of the year. We now recognize that it will take longer for our actions to slow the growth of inventory as we work to strike the right balance between slowing material inflow and meeting growing customer requirements. Our efforts have begun to reduce the underlying rate of increase of physical inventory, and we expect this improvement to continue. Given our leverage, the demand on cash is manageable with free cash flow turning strongly positive in Q4, reversing a 3 quarter use of cash. We are actively managing the situation. First, we are working to reduce material inflow while dealing with material constraints and ensuring a healthy supply chain. We are unlocking production challenges to improve throughput and material flow whilst dealing with material availability and labor constraints. We reflected during Investor Day that cash flow would take until fiscal '25, '26 before it would normalize. We are confident that this is getting the necessary attention and oversight throughout the organization. We have executed and will continue to drive many tactical changes that are slowing inventory. We are now focused on longer-term actions to drive improvement by fiscal '25, '26. On these 2 key issues, I believe we are making progress. We have significantly reduced risk on our space vehicle contracts, and we have made initial progress on physical inventory and will drive progressive improvement over the coming quarters.Overall, I remain very optimistic for our business. We have a strong growth, which I see as a sign that we are creating value for our customers. In addition, we've made excellent progress on our journey to improve margins through simplification and pricing. Now I'll hand over to Jennifer to review our financials in more detail.Story continuesJennifer WalterThanks, Pat. I'll begin with a review of our third quarter financial performance. I'll then provide an update on our guidance for all of fiscal year '23. It was another exceptional quarter from a sales perspective. For the second quarter in a row, we hit a record level of sales for the company. Our adjusted operating margin was 10.2%, including $14 million of charges on space vehicle programs. Our underlying operational performance was strong this quarter. We achieved $1.37 of adjusted earnings per share, which was negatively impacted by $0.33 from the space vehicle charges and was positively impacted by $0.13 from tax adjustments associated with higher R&amp;D tax credits. This suggests performance near the high end of our guidance when carving out these 2 factors. Sales in the third quarter were $850 million. Total company sales increased 10% over the same quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of divestitures, sales were up 11%.The largest increase in segment sales was in aircraft controls. Sales of $355 million increased 12% over the same quarter a year ago. Commercial OE sales in the quarter were especially strong, driven by the continued market recovery in wide-body platforms as well as growth on business jets. Commercial aftermarket sales were at a record high with strong sales on the A350 program, which has been steadily ramping over the past several quarters.Military aircraft sales declined in the third quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The military sales decrease reflects lower funded development activity, including the delayed start on the flower program. In addition, military aftermarket sales were down slightly from the same quarter a year ago. Sales in Space and Defense Controls of $242 million increased 8% over the third quarter last year. Adjusting for the divestiture of a security business last year, sales increased 11%. The ramp-up in production on the reconfigurable turret program, which hit full rate production levels in the first quarter this year, drove sales this quarter. The sales growth was also driven by increased activity on avionics and components for satellites.Industrial Systems sales increased 9% to $253 million. Excluding the divestiture of our sonar business last year, sales were up 11%. Within Industrial Systems, our Industrial Automation sales growth was driven by demand for capital equipment. This business has recovered nicely since the pandemic, but we're now seeing orders slow down in line with global capital spend. Our growing construction business is also contributing to the industrial automation sales strength. Simulation and test sales were also strong, driven by high demand on flight simulation systems. Sales and energy adjusting for the divestiture last year were up nicely compared to a year ago. These sales increases were partially offset by lower sales in medical, which was impacted by supply chain issues.We'll now shift to operating margins. Adjusted operating margin of 10.2% in the third quarter decreased 30 basis points from the third quarter last year. The space vehicle charges pressured our total operating margin by 150 basis points. These pressures were mostly offset by strong operational performance on our underlying business and a marginal return on the sales increase. Adjustments to operating profit this quarter and the same quarter a year ago were $2 million and $1 million, respectively. These adjustments reflect restructuring and other charges.I'll now describe the key drivers of our adjusted operating margins for each of our segments. Operating margin in Aircraft Controls was 10.9% in the third quarter compared to 11.0% in the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin in Space and Defense Controls was 7.8%, down 360 basis points from 11.4% a year ago. As Pat described, we incurred significant charges on space vehicle programs again this quarter, over 500 basis points worth, masking the benefit associated with higher sales and improvements in the core business.Operating margin in Industrial Systems was 11.5%, up nicely over the 8.7% of last year's third quarter. Benefits associated with our pricing initiatives accounted for 3 quarters of this improvement. In addition, last year's margin was pressured by supply chain disruptions and the pandemic impacting our operations in China.Interest expense is another area that's impacting our financial results. In the third quarter, interest expense was $17 million, up $8 million over the third quarter last year. The increase in interest expense relates to higher interest rates and to a lesser extent, higher levels of debt. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 16.0%, about the same as in the third quarter of last year. We're benefiting from higher levels of R&amp;D tax credits and have captured these benefits in our return to provision third quarter adjustments in both years.Putting it all together, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.37 within the range we provided a quarter ago. EPS is down 15% from the same quarter a year ago due to higher interest expense and corporate expense, partially offset by increased operating profit. Let's shift over to cash flow. In the third quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $19 million. Net earnings were solid, and capital expenditures were on plan. However, net working capital, in particular, physical inventories grew substantially.Growth in physical inventories, both unbilled receivables for long-term contracts and inventory as shown on the balance sheet resulted from continuing to receive in materials at a faster rate than shipping product to customers. We've maintained material flow to ensure we're positioned well for customer deliveries. However, a combination of staffing shortages, supply chain challenges and production inefficiencies have limited our ability to convert inventories to cash. In addition, this quarter, we took ownership of some inventory from a vendor to prevent a supply chain disruption.Capital expenditures were $35 million. That's pretty much in line with our average spending last year and just over the average quarterly spend this year, excluding the facility we purchased last quarter. We're investing in facilities to accommodate our growth, focus our factories and enhance our capabilities through automation. Our leverage ratio, calculated on a net debt basis as of the end of the third quarter was 2.7x, within our target range of 2.25x to 2.75x. Our capital deployment priorities, both long term and near term are unchanged. Our current priority continues to be investing for organic growth. We'll now shift over to guidance for the full year. Compared to a quarter ago, we're increasing sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share and modifying operating margin down slightly. Based on continuing pressures on cash, we are decreasing our free cash flow guidance for the year. Let's take a more detailed look at our guidance. We're projecting sales of $3.3 billion in fiscal year '23, which is up $60 million over our previous guidance. That's a 7% sales increase compared to FY '22 and 9% when we adjust for divestitures over the past year and the impact of foreign currency movements.We expect high single-digit organic sales growth in each of our segments. Aircraft control sales are projected to increase 8% to $1.4 billion. The increase is all on the commercial side of the business. Commercial OE will be up across the board with growth on Airbus and Boeing platforms, business jets and the Genesis business we acquired a couple of years ago. We'll also see growth in an already strong commercial aftermarket business.To account for the strong sales this quarter, we're increasing our commercial OE forecast by $35 million and our aftermarket sales forecast by $20 million.We expect a decline in military aircraft sales, driven by lower funded development and aftermarket sales. We're decreasing our military aircraft sales guidance by $30 million to reflect the results we're seeing, especially related to funded development activities.Space and Defense Controls sales are projected to increase 7% to $930 million. Adjusting for the divestiture of a security business late last fiscal year, sales will be up 9%. When looking at our numbers within the segment, you may recall that we shifted a product line from defense into space at the beginning of our first quarter. We've now adjusted last year's numbers for that shift in our supplemental materials.Space sales will increase for satellite components and space vehicles, and defense sales will increase on production ramps for the reconfigurable turret and tactical missile programs. Our sales forecast is up $10 million over our previous forecast, reflecting the strong sales levels we're achieving in both space and defense.Industrial Systems sales are projected to increase 6% to $965 million. Adjusting for the sale of the sonar business and foreign currency movements, the increase is 10%. Most of the growth will come from industrial automation and simulation tests, both of which were particularly strong this quarter. Our sales forecast is up $25 million from our previous forecast on record sales this quarter.Let's shift over to operating margins. We've updated our segment operating profit and margin guidance to reflect retroactive pricing benefits we'll get in the fourth quarter on aircraft programs. The higher level of sales we're now projecting and the charges we incurred this quarter on space vehicle programs. We're now projecting an adjusted operating margin of 10.9% in fiscal year '23, which is up from 10.2% in fiscal year '22.Industrial Systems will increase 190 basis points to 11.4%, largely due to progress on pricing initiatives. Aircraft Controls will increase 70 basis points to 10.8%, also reflecting the benefit we'll see from pricing initiatives. Factory utilization will improve as sales in the commercial OE business increased. However, this benefit will be largely offset by an unfavorable mix with the relative increase in Commercial OE.Operating margin in Space and Defense Controls will decrease 40 basis points to 10.5%, reflecting $25 million of charges incurred on space vehicle programs this year, offset by incremental return on higher sales. Higher interest expense will depress adjusted earnings per share by $0.62 relative to fiscal year '22. For fiscal year '23, we're now projecting adjusted earnings per share of $5.75 plus or minus $0.10, which is up 3% over fiscal year '22. Adjusting for interest, EPS would be $6.37, an increase of 15%, reflecting strong operational performance. Next quarter, we're forecasting earnings per share to be $1.71 plus or minus $0.10.Finally, turning to cash. We're projecting free cash flow for fiscal year '23 to be negative $60 million, down from 0 that we were projecting 90 days ago. The change largely reflects our third quarter growth in physical inventories. As we move into the fourth quarter, we expect working capital to be a source of cash, the first time in several quarters. Receivables will be the largest generator of cash within working capital. Accruals for compensation will normalize from a timing perspective in the fourth quarter, also contributing to free cash flow generation. Those sources of cash will be partially offset by continued growth in physical inventories, though we're beginning to see the growth in physical inventories trend downward. Outside of working capital, we're projecting a strong earnings quarter and we're maintaining our forecast of $165 million in capital expenditures for the year. Overall, we had a solid third quarter, and our outlook for the fourth quarter looks strong. We're positioned well from a liquidity and leverage standpoint, enabling us to invest for future growth in our business. And now I'll turn it over to Pat.Patrick J. RocheThank you, Jennifer. As you've heard, we closed out a solid quarter, delivering record sales. And we're on a path to deliver a fiscal year with 9% organic sales growth and 70 basis points margin improvement. We are now happy to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question is going to come from Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley.Kristine Tan LiwagGreat. First, on pricing. You guys mentioned aircraft controls. You're getting the pricing increases rolling through. Can you quantify that? And are you seeing that in specific aircraft programs or all programs? And how much of a pricing increase is this?Patrick J. RocheKristine, good morning. How are you?Kristine Tan LiwagGreat. Great. Happy Friday.Patrick J. RocheThank you. So I think we've made really strong progress during the course of this year in pricing conversations with our customers. It's across all of our customers on the commercial aircraft side of the business. And in the other businesses, as I've emphasized in the Investor Day, in those conversations, we also said at Investor Day that some of them have been going on for an extended period of time. And we reached agreement with our customer that the negotiation would be retrospective to the 1st of January. And so now that we've concluded those conversations with our customer, we're able to, in the fourth quarter, reflect an increased operating margin in our Aircraft group as those prices flow through. The gain or step-up in performance of the aircraft group in Q4 is including that retrospective pricing element. And so it will be in our business going forward, but not at the same high level of operating margin as Q4 will show for Aircraft group.So I would say, in answer to your question, Kristine, we don't want to be specific about which customer it is and it is across multiple customers within our Aircraft group business. And I don't think we want to share the increment of the increase at this point. Although in Q4, we will do a retrospective that shows how much gain has come through pricing in our business and how much has come through simplification.Jennifer, do you have anything you'd like to add?Jennifer WalterNo, I think that's fair, Pat. I think we've made a lot of progress. As Pat said, we've got a retro coming up in the fourth quarter. So when we look at it for the full year, pricing is a substantial contributor to the margin enhancement for all of fiscal year '23 compared to all of fiscal year '22 across our aircraft business.Kristine Tan LiwagGreat. It's great to see you guys make progress there. And so when we think about this pricing reset, is this a onetime reset on all -- on the programs that you have? Or is this something that we should expect to occur on an annual basis?Patrick J. RocheI would describe it as a progressive program, Kristine. We have still more work to do on pricing with other customers, so it's ongoing. And in addition, the pricing that we have negotiated with our customers to date has included a provision in the contracts for escalation year-over-year. And so we have a framework and a mechanism for further increases over time, depending on certain indices that we're tracking.Kristine Tan LiwagGreat. And if I could squeeze one last one on free cash flow. I mean we've seen fairly dramatic cuts in free cash flow outlook now for two consecutive quarters. I mean, what would -- is this -- what makes you confident that negative $60 million is for the year? And is that a conservative enough number if revenue maybe picks up even more than you thought?And then also, at some point, we'll see an inventory unwind. At what pace do you think that unwinds that will be for 2024, could we see all of that come back and you get your normal course of positive free cash flow plus the inventory unwind?Patrick J. RocheYes. I'll start, and then I'll hand over to Jennifer as well for some comments on this. I think the difference where we sit today is that we know it's taking longer to slow the rate of growth. We took a lot of actions in the last 90 days, which have had an impact and have slowed down the growth of inventory, but it's striking that right balance between the inflow of materials and sufficient material on hand to meet our customers' requirements.So that's a little bit longer going and taking a little bit more time than we anticipated. It will -- to your point, it will unwind, Kristine. The inventory that we have is nonperishable, and it will get used in our programs. That unwind will begin to come through in future quarters.But you've got to bear in mind that our -- especially our commercial aircraft programs are ramping. We are currently running at rate 5 on our Boeing production. So that's up from the rate 4 we were previously running, and we are getting -- we are ahead because of our lead times of Boeing's own rates.So the unwind is balanced in some way by a pickup in inventory required for those higher rates in the future. So that will play out during the course of fiscal '24. Our cash used in '24 is the demand for next year. Our free cash conversion will be -- I don't know if we gave the figure in Investor Day, it will be lower than it will be in '25, '26, but we get back to the normalized levels in '25, '26. So there are demands through the course of next year. So you see it as multiple quarters as we go through this transition now.Jennifer, do you have anything to add to that?Jennifer WalterYes. Maybe just to complement that. So for our forecast this year, for a $60 million use of cash, to your point, I would say it's balanced. To your point, if we have higher sales, we may be pressured from the receivable standpoint associated with that. But I would say, overall, it's balanced. The area we give confidence to it when we're looking at how the fourth quarter is going to shape up is we do have -- we have some customer advances that were built late in Q3. And just on the normal terms associated with that, we will get the collections of that advance in Q4. With our high level of sales in Q3, we'll also collect on those sales as well. So there's definitely some things, especially on the receivables side, that will help us as we move into the fourth quarter.We're also seeing a slowdown in the need for growth in physical inventory. So it's still growing. But over the past few quarters, it's been decreasing. So in the first quarter, it was about $71 million. In the second quarter, it was $67 million. Although in the third quarter, it was $65 million. That included about $10 million of a payment we made to prevent a supply chain disruption by taking some inventory from a vendor. And we're projecting that to improve to $40 million in Q4.So we are seeing a slowdown in the growth of physical inventories, but we're not yet projecting that to turn.As we look into next year, we're expecting a modest level of free cash flow generation, which is consistent with what we said a month or 2 ago as well. So definitely physical inventories is an area that will take us a while to work through.OperatorAnd our next question is going to come from Michael Ciarmoli from Truist Securities.Michael Frank CiarmoliJust Jennifer, I guess, to stay on the inventory and cash side of things. Can you kind of specify what end markets, from a material standpoint, I guess, that you're trying to reduce, is it more aerospace-related or industrial? And then any color on where you are with 787 inventories? I know you guys have been building ahead there. It sounds like Boeing is certainly pushing for five a month by year-end and kind of how that fits into kind of the equation?Jennifer WalterYes. From a market perspective, we're seeing the supply chain pressures in many of our markets. Each of our markets is reacting a little bit different, but we're still seeing supply chain constraints in many areas for electronics. Some areas have eased up a little bit, but there's also some sourcing in other areas that continue to pop up as well on that.I would say in our industrial businesses, it's easing up from a standpoint of our matching of incoming materials to what is being able to be processed. However, there's different things that are happening in the aerospace business. And they still seem like there's changing associate with it. So for instance, we're still keeping our incoming receipts for the most part, fairly level from our supply chain. We want to make sure, first, that we've got everything that we need so that we can meet customer requirements, and also to make sure that we've got a healthy supply chain.Obviously, we want to balance that so that we're not carrying excess amounts of safety stock. So we're being very careful, but it's a very tedious process to go through and make these decisions, and then input them into our systems, and then wait for it to actually manifest through our numbers.But in some of the A&amp;D side of the business, and it's in different parts of it, some places we've got, we're short on staff a little bit. So when we've got the materials in, it still takes a while for us to push those products through based on our staffing.Some of the supply chain challenges are happening as well, and this throughput through our factories of making that all happen. So if we get a huge slug of inventories in, even from our supply chain, the time that it still takes to process it through doesn't necessarily mean that we'll catch up right away. So there's second level challenges that we're facing even though that we are getting materials in the door.As it relates to 787 inventories, currently, it's not having a significant amount of impact on our free cash flow. However, we are carrying inventory that we had built up in previous periods, especially in fiscal year '22. That's going to help us as we start going into this ramp, and we're at that five a month rate right now on that. So right now, it's stable, not causing any further pressure, but -- and we do have stock in hand so that we can manage as we move forward.Michael Frank CiarmoliGot it. And then what about -- you called out the, I think, earlier the unbilled receivables. What sort of the line of sight in terms of driving that down? Do you -- is it more milestone-based? Are they presumably more on the space and defense side? And should we expect that to be more of a tailwind out in '25 or '26? Or do you think you can start unwinding some of that in the shorter term?Jennifer WalterYes. So the unbilled receivables, there's a number of things that are happening, first of all, with our level of activity. We've got continuing growth with our sales growth. A lot of our business on the A&amp;D side is on long-term contracting. So it does happen to go through the unbilled receivables as we have progress on that.Certain things have gotten delayed in the unbilled and converting that over into cash. For instance, the space vehicle charges that we described, the delays associated with that, the higher expenses has delayed our activity on that, such that the cash that we would have expected to get in this year, we're now projecting getting into next year instead. So there's different things on different programs.Michael Frank CiarmoliOkay. And then, Pat, can I just try the pricing in aircraft one more time. I mean can you maybe even -- I know you don't want to maybe give a lot of specifics, but are you having more success immediately in the aftermarket? Or are you getting some on the OE side?I figured that the conversations with Boeing and Airbus might be a bit more challenging there. And then are you getting some across the military as well? And then I, guess, with that price, you talked about some of the escalators, but are you trying to manage, I guess, future price step-downs with volumes? Are those components in the conversations as well?Patrick J. RocheWell, thanks, Michael. The pricing activity is across all of the OEMs and all of the aftermarket. So it's not limited to OEM activity. And as you know, in some of our OEM contracts, aftermarket is an element of the contract, and that's part of the contract discussions.So all those factors are rolling into the conversations that we're having. But my position is that we've made great progress with those conversations with the customers. There's a recognition on both sides to have a sustainable business. There had to be an adjustment, and that has come through now.So I'm really pleased, Michael, where we got to with those conversations. And the impact then, as we say, will show through in Q4 and throughout next year.OperatorAnd our new question is going to come from Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen.Cai von RumohrYes. So maybe switching back for a second to space, another large charge. How close are we to the end of this? I mean what should we be looking for as a milestone to say, from here on out, we shouldn't expect more space vehicle charges?Patrick J. RocheCai, welcome, and thank you for the question. I think we have really done a good job over the last 2 months in burning down the risk associated with that space vehicle program. There are two programs on which we have shipped units. The first six of our Meteorite class units.Those shipments completed 2 weeks ago -- or last week was the last shipment out of our facility to our customers' facility.So in terms of the integration and test activities, all of those have been completed for all six units. So that's one element that reduces the risk down. We know that the hardware is functional, and it is with our customers at this point.The software, we have a revision of software to be delivered to the customer on August 11. So that's within the next 2 weeks. So we're in the final stages of working through that update to code. And so again, because we're so close to the finish line now with the software, we have really high confidence that we have the issues addressed in terms of delivery there. And we don't expect to see a change in the cost of development of the software as a consequence of being so close to the finish line at this point.We also sent in an expert team about 2 months ago to do an assessment on work left to be completed, and that was part of revising the estimate to complete. So 90 days ago, I would have said we were 90% complete. If I look at the estimates to complete, as of last week, we were 97% to 98% complete. So we are, most of the way, almost entirely through those two programs, Cai.Cai von RumohrSo is that both Meteor and Meteorite the both the two vehicles, basically you've had shipments on? Are those six all Meteorites?Patrick J. RocheSo it is on the Meteorite class that we have shipped six satellites.Cai von RumohrAnd the Meteor?Patrick J. RocheOn the Meteor, we will ship the first of those in the latter part of this calendar year. What's my point around Meteor and Meteorite is that they have a common platform of avionics, which is the electronics that control the system and a common base of software.And so a lot of the complexity and the integration risk is actually associated with those parts of the system. Many of the hardware components are also similar. What might vary from one to the next is the propulsion system and the size of the solar ray panels, but there's a high level of commonality. So I would look at them as a modular platforms, Cai, which is another reason why we have confidence.Cai von RumohrVery good answer. So getting back to the cash flow. So what about -- as we think about next year or so, I guess, we can expect the inventory to continue to go up. But even with some improvement, it looks like your DSOs have really been going up a fair amount.Where do you see those going next year? Where do you see kind of your payables relative to sales? And also with the inventory uptick, it looks like you're close to 23% of sales, whereas if we go back to '22, you've gotten down to below 20%. So it looks like there's really quite a lot of excess inventory relative to your sales level. When do you see that sort of starting to cross?Jennifer WalterSo I'll take that, Cai. We'll give further detailed guidance on fiscal year '24 when we do this in 90 days. But just on a general type of basis, what we can expect to see is, on physical inventories, as you mentioned, we're going to continue to see growth. We expect that to moderate at least in this fourth quarter, and we'll comment more on next year in next quarter's call.We will have a little bit of lumpiness associated with our customer advances. Our customer advances level right now is strong. but it comes in lumps. And we do expect to see some, next year, probably in the later part of next year, and it's just due to program timing that we've got.We are still expecting to generate modest levels of free cash flow generation, which is what we shared in the Investor Day for fiscal year '24. So some of the inventories that we're talking about now, the physical inventories, we would not see a significant turn in that until we're getting out in some out years when we'll return to more normal levels of free cash flow.Cai von RumohrRight. But so what about the receivables? I mean the DSOs look like they also are higher. I mean do you expect your collection rate to improve?Jennifer WalterThere's a couple of forces. There's -- they're offsetting forces. So let me describe that. Right now, our sales are high. There's a couple of -- our receivables are high. So they're high to the level of sales that we have.If you look at our balance sheet right now, there is a gross up between some receivables and advances for advances that we have build, but not collected until the fourth quarter. So that comes through, but that just shows up as a bad guy in our receivables in the third quarter, but that converts fully to cash in the fourth quarter.As our sales continue to grow, there is pressure on our receivables That continues to happen, especially on the ramp-up associated with our aircraft business where terms are less favorable than the average of the company. And that's the area of the business that we're growing. So there are pressures associated with that. But again, we do have the strong collections that we're expecting from the Q3 sales that we had as well as the advances that we are collecting, and that's the timing from Q3 to Q4.Cai von RumohrGot it. So Pat, you described lots of improvements, which all sound really very good and better pricing going forward on aircraft on a normalized basis. And space defense like we're out of, hopefully, we have less problems from the satellite vehicles.And industrial, you've got some price hikes. You're looking for, I think, 100 basis points on average for the next couple of years. I mean it would look like you would get sort of a proportional percent of that next year. I mean you could be close to up 100 basis points on the op margin. Am I reading that incorrectly?Patrick J. RocheWe are feeling really confident, Cai, that we are going to deliver on the 100 basis points a year on average, as we said in the Investor Day. Everything that we're doing is on track towards that at this point.Operator(Operator Instructions) Michael Ciarmoli from Trust Securities.Michael Frank CiarmoliPat, just can you give us maybe a little bit more insight into maybe within Space and Defense, do you have a lot of other development contracts or new start contracts? I mean we are seeing this mix shift across the defense sector of legacy programs winding down, new programs ramping up.And I mean just to try and get an assessment of maybe how much risk you see with some of the other contracts in there. For example, I don't know if you have any firm fixed development contracts, but just trying to maybe get a framework on what else could crop up in that sector?Patrick J. RocheThanks, Michael. I think we have, in general, reducing our exposure to -- from fixed contracts in our military side of the business. We have some, for sure. We have some legacy programs that are still to close out. And there are a couple of pieces of business in space and defense that are still under fixed price contracts.So I think that we feel comfortable with the profile that we have there, Michael. I wouldn't say it's degrading in answer to your question.OperatorAnd I have no further questions in the queue at this time, and I'll turn the call back over to Aaron Astrachan. Please go ahead.Aaron AstrachanSo it's back to Pat, and I appreciate you taking the time to join the call, and I look forward to meeting you all again in 90 days' time. Thank you very much.OperatorAnd this concludes today's call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

132,4b3bc999-241f-3ee5-b452-a09060b3a853,BA,2023-07-29,All Nippon Airways big cargo loser in 2nd quarter,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nippon-airways-big-cargo-loser-201310085.html,1690575190,STORY,"['9202.T', '9101.T', 'AF.PA', 'BABWF', 'AFLYY', 'BA']","[All Nippon Airways has a large fleet of widebody passenger aircraft, including Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners (pictured), that carry cargo below the passenger deck. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Cargo revenue at All Nippon Airways was significantly worse than its peer group during the calendar second quarter, with the Japanese combination carrier on Friday reporting a 60% decline in sales for goods transport on its passenger and dedicated cargo jets.International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways and four other carriers, experienced a 32% drop in cargo revenue, while second-quarter cargo receipts at Air France-KLM Group (DXE: AFKLM) contracted by a third year over year, according to earnings results published the same day.U.S. rivals Delta, American and United previously said top numbers for cargo fell 37% to 40% during the three-month period. All three, plus IAG, are pure passenger airlines. All Nippon Airways has the advantage of operating nine Boeing 767 medium widebody freighters and two large 777 freighters in addition to 225 passenger aircraft.The Japanese airline said international cargo revenue for the first quarter of the fiscal year fell 60% to 38.1 billion yen ($272.1 million) on a 20.4% drop in volume despite efforts to capture trans-Pacific traffic. Load factors decreased nearly 14 points to 54.7% and yield fell 47.5%.Volumes were impacted by lower shipping demand for semiconductors, electronics and automotive goods.Revenue ton kilometers, a measure that influences revenue because the price includes a distance component, declined five points more for ANA’s freighters than the fleet overall. But freighter load factors were more stable, dipping 2.6% to 63.4%.ANA’s results are a microcosm of the challenging economic environment facing the air cargo sector, which has been in recession since the second half of last year. Air cargo demand has fallen 7% to 10% since March 2022, as ocean supply chains recovered and the global economy slowed, while capacity has steadily climbed with the reintroduction of more international passenger services in the wake of the COVID crisis. Shipping rates are 40% to 50% cheaper than a year ago.Story continuesThe cargo division’s performance was slightly better when including domestic transport, which represents a much smaller share of the business.Despite the downward result, revenue was 1.5 times higher compared to 2019 levels.ANA said it has responded by instituting more flexible flight scheduling for freighters and targeting more interline traffic, in which cargo is transferred from one airline to another at an intermediate location and the proceeds are shared. Management projected cargo volume will be flat in the third quarter.During the fiscal year that ended March 30, ANA’s cargo revenue fell 25%.Earlier this month, ANA reached a final agreement with Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK Line) to acquire Nippon Cargo Airlines in a stock transaction scheduled for Oct. 1. The ocean carrier tentatively agreed in March to sell its air cargo operation because rising costs needed to sustain growth, such as ongoing requirements for new aircraft and maintenance, were more than it was willing to bear.NCA owns and controls 15 Boeing 747 jumbo freighters: eight 747-8s it flies under its own operating certificate plus five older 747-400s operated on its behalf by U.S.-based Atlas Air and two 747-400s crewed by ASL Airlines Belgium.The deal is a central part of ANA’s new strategy to grow its cargo business. ANA said NCA’s fleet of large freighters and focus on international service will help it better manage market volatility and provide needed capacity as passenger airlines downsize aircraft, leaving less belly space for freight.The International Air Transport Association recently certified ANA for meeting the highest quality standards for handling perishable goods, which the carrier anticipates will help attract more customers. Proper training, handling procedures and cold-chain infrastructure are essential for maintaining freshness during transport.Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries wants to increase exports of agricultural, forestry and seafood products.ANA’s overall performance, including a 14% gain in revenue, enabled it to achieve the first operating profit in four years for the first quarter.IAG and AFKLMIAG (LSE: IAG) reported cargo revenue of 280 million euros ($309.5 million) during the second quarter, a 32% decrease from the year-ago period. British Airways and Iberia deliver nearly all cargo business for the group.IAG’s results were slightly better in the first quarter. For the first half, cargo revenue and average unit prices were down 28.5% and 37.6%, respectively. Compared to 2019, revenue increased 8.5% despite a 15% decrease in tonnage, with yields up more than a third.IAG Cargo recently opened a $110 million cargo facility at London Heathrow Airport, its hub. The large, semiautomated warehouse more than doubles handling capacity and includes a sophisticated refrigerated area for pharmaceutical and life science products.Overall, IAG reported it quadrupled adjusted operating profit of $1.4 billion for the quarter from a year ago. It also announced the exercise of options to order 787-10 Dreamliners from Boeing, plus six more options for the long-haul aircraft. It also converted one Airbus A350-900 option held by Iberia into a firm order. The aircraft will be delivered in 2025 and 2026.Meanwhile, Air France-KLM said second-quarter cargo revenue was $670 million, 34% lower than the same 2022 period. Tonnage fell 10%, but the main driver behind the results was excess capacity (up 6.5%) that pressured rates, as reflected in a 43% drop in unit revenue. The fill rate for cargo space was 44.6%, down more than 7 points.The Air France-KLM Group operates six cargo jets (KLM’s three Boeing 747-400 production freighters, Martinair’s one 747-400 converted freighter and Air France’s two 777-200s).In early April, CMA CGM and Air France-KLM kicked off their 10-year alliance under which they will jointly market freighter capacity and combine networks and dedicated services to increase scale and competitiveness.Air-France KLM’s enterprise operating profit increased 90% to $810 million, but the company said it expects costs to increase in the second half due to fuel and higher salaries.Click here for more FreightWaves and American Shipper articles by Eric Kulisch.RECOMMENDED READING:American, United Airlines’ cargo revenue smacked down by weak marketPrice war keeps air cargo rates below natural levelNYK Line bucks trend, exits cargo airline businessThe post All Nippon Airways big cargo loser in 2nd quarter appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy, Kathy?Kathy Warden: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. As you saw from this morning's earnings release, global demand for Northrop Grumman solutions is driving exceptional growth. In the second quarter, our sales were up 9% with solid contributions from each of our four business segments. Our ability to hire and retain talent and improving supplier deliveries are strengthening our top line. Even our year-to-date sales increase of 7% and an improved outlook. We're increasing our full year's sales guidance range by 400 million. In addition, award volume in the quarter was robust, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.14. As a result, we're increasing our full year book-to-bill projection to approximately 1.0. Our $79 billion backlog continues to be more than two times our expected 2023 sales supporting our long term growth outlook.Story continuesWe delivered solid second quarter earnings per share of $5.34. And we're increasing the lower end of our full year guidance range by $0.20. And free cash flow was healthy in the quarter more than a billion dollar higher than Q2 of last year, positioning us well for our full year target. Turning to the budget environment and starting with the U.S. We're encouraged by the continued bipartisan support for national security funding to implement the administration's national defense strategy. The FY ‘24 budget and recent congressional committee bill prioritize modernization including areas of strength in our portfolio, such as the triad, the space domain, information superiority, and advanced weapons. We also anticipate continued support for Ukraine and related emergency spending, which would represent even further increased demand.Global demand for our products also continues to grow as our allies increase defense spending to address evolving threats. We are well positioned in multiple markets to meet this demand with programs such as [Argonne] IBCS and E2-D as well as munitions. With a robust backlog and leading growth outlook. I'd like to now spend a few minutes outlining our path to margin expansion, which is a key element of our earnings and cash flow growth plan. Our 2023 operating margin dollar guidance is in the range we've previously provided. This guidance implies a segment margin rate in the mid 11% range in the second half of 2023. Having delivered a rate of 10.9% in the first half. We also see an opportunity to increase our year-over-year margin rate in 2024, and get to a 12% target in the longer term.Achieving this margin improvement is built on three key drivers. First, is the stabilization of temporal macro economic factors that have driven higher cost and impacted our supply chain and labor efficiency. Second, is the ongoing implementation of cost management programs across the company that helps drive affordability, competitiveness, and performance. And third is our business mix, which we see shifting to more international and production contracts. As international demand grows, and many of our current development programs mature over the next several years. With regard to the macro economic factors, supply chain disruptions rooted in the pandemic, and the subsequent labor market tightness, have created programs delays and cost growth.To reduce this disruption, we're buying ahead of schedule pursuing second sources where it makes sense and placing more of our people at suppliers to facilitate timely material delivery. We see signs of progress across our supply chain from these actions. And we are seeing fewer new issues emerge. We've had exceptional performance in growing our headcount since the second half of 2022, and attrition rates are down to pre pandemic levels. Our focus now is on optimizing labor efficiency, which is an important driver of profitability. To accelerate the learning curve for our employees. We're leaning forward with innovative training programs and standardizing work instructions. Inflation has been a challenge for industry as well as others, cost growth has now begun to moderate.But the last 18 months of inflation continue to have a higher base effect on our costs, especially in labor. If you look at our year end 2021 fixed price backlog, it was largely priced before we began to experience elevated levels of inflation. However, of that backlog, approximately 70% will have been converted into sales by the end of this year. And for new bids, we are factoring higher inflation expectations into our contracts. We're also working to drive additional discipline in our bid approaches, particularly on fixed price contracts to help protect against these types of dynamics in the future. Overall, we anticipate that these macro economic impacts have stabilized and now have largely been incorporated into our margins risk factors.The second key driver of margin opportunity is cost management, which benefits both affordability and competitiveness. We are laser focused on overhead cost reduction. A foundational element of these reductions is our implementation of digital solutions across our business, which will help to drive performance and productivity. For example, we've built a digital ecosystem that focuses on program execution, bringing together employees, customers and partners into an integrated environment, so they can seamlessly work together. This accelerates design, integration, testing and deployment across programs helping us to deliver with quality, speed and efficiency. We're increasing the number of programs that are operating in this ecosystem. And today, we have over 100 active programs that are doing so, we're also investing in and advancing the technologies and digital systems in our factories.We're scaling this across the enterprise to drive efficiencies that should benefit all of our stakeholders. For example, on the B-21 we've successfully demonstrated the use of this digital thread high to advanced manufacturing technology to realize over 15% labor efficiencies in one area of the build. And in June, we launched the expansion of this approach across the whole build process. We're extending this digital thread into our business operation to deliver further benefits across the company. This includes how we're managing our supply chain, where we've broadly centralized procurement, and we're working to leverage our purchasing power to reduce costs. We have over 20,000 suppliers and we've begun securely connecting them into our digital ecosystem.Over the next several years, we expect to have the majority of our supply base fully integrated, this is expected to lower supplier costs and significantly improve productivity. The third key area of margin opportunity is our business mix. For several years we've had one of the highest cost plus development contract mixes in the industry reflecting our significant early stage position on key franchise programs, which will transition to production throughout this decade. This cost plus mix has been increasing with our first house revenue at 55% Cost Plus up from about 50:50 last year. Looking forward, we see this shifting towards more fixed price revenue, rising to approximately 60% of sales by 2027. As a number of large programs in all four of our sectors transition to production.Production program margins are typically a few points higher than development margin. So mix shift can contribute meaningfully to our segment operating margin rates. And we're making good progress on moving programs through development and into production. For example [Argonne ER] completed its fifth consecutive test flight in the second quarter. This program is nearing completion of its development phase, and is on track to ramp production volumes next year. And on B-21, we successfully powered on the first flight test aircraft in the quarter another important milestone in our campaign to achieve first flight in transition to production. We also expect our international business to grow at a double digit rate over the next few years, improving our margin opportunity as global sales become a larger percentage of our mix.Photo by NASA on UnsplashIn the second quarter, we demonstrated our IBCS solution for eight potential international customers, reflecting growing demand for this advanced air and missile defense capability. We also signed a memorandum of agreement with Rheinmetall to expand capacity for F-35 center fuselage production in Europe. We expect these three drivers to result in improved affordability, even better performance and higher margins. When combined with the strength of our backlog and increasing global demand. These operating margin improvements should provide the foundation for strong future free cash flow growth. Now with respect to capital deployment, we're executing a strategy that prioritizes investments to support our business plan and returns cash to shareholders.In May we increased our dividend for the 20th consecutive year by 8%. Year-to-date, we have returned $1.5 billion to shareholders and are on track to meet our goal of returning more than 100% of free cash flow this year. Overall, the global defense budget outlook and our alignment with customer priorities give us confidence in our growth trajectory. We are focused on margin expansion opportunities and converting this to free cash flow growth to deliver value both for our customers and our shareholders. So with that, I'll hand it over to Dave and he'll cover details of the second quarter financial results and updates to our full year outlook.David Keffer: Thanks, Kathy. And good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another solid quarter, we remain focused on executing our strategy and believe we're well positioned to grow our topline earnings and cash flows for years to come. The demand environment continues to be robust, supported by the alignment of our portfolio with our customers highest priority missions. And those Kathy described, we see a path to expand margins in the second half of this year and beyond. As macro pressures ease and we drive efficiencies into our business as it grows and experiences mixed tailwinds. Now turning to Q2 results, we generated $10.9 billion of new awards, a higher total than we previously expected, our book-to-bill was 1.14 and was driven by restricted awards of $5.4 billion.This brings our year-to-date total to $8.6 billion in restricted bookings. Looking forward, we expect a number of production awards in the second half of the year, including the first lot of B-21 LRIP. Moving to sales on Slide 4 in our earnings deck, we’ve delivered strong topline growth of 9% in the second quarter. Building on the momentum from Q1 as a result of our success in bringing on new employees, incremental improvements in the supply chain and continued backlog strength our sales are growing at a higher rate, and we've increased our full year guidance. With respect to segment results all four of our businesses grew in the second quarter. Space continues to lead the way with their second consecutive quarter of 17% sales growth as GBSD, NGI and restricted space programs continue to ramp.In defense system sales increased 10% on the strength of their armaments and Missile Defense franchises. Mission Systems growth of 5% was driven by restricted programs in the networked information solutions business and aeronautics systems returned to growth as higher volume on restricted programs outpaced the headwinds on legacy programs as we've anticipated. Turning to Slide 5, segment margins in the second quarter were 11%. Keep in mind that Q2 of last year included over $70 million or 80 basis points of benefit from a land sale and a contract related legal matter. Most importantly, margin dollars improved incrementally from Q1, largely meeting our expectations. Program performance remains strong across the portfolio, as the team does a good job in navigating the lingering disruption from the pandemic and macro economic factors we've been discussing.One area of pressure we experienced in the quarter was a $36 million unfavorable adjustment on NASA's habitation and logistics outposts program or HALO in our space system sector. Moving to earnings per share on Slide 6, diluted EPs in the second quarter were $5.34. This included lower net pension income of roughly $1 per share partially offset by more favorable returns on marketable securities than in the same period last year. Slide 7 highlights the non operational pension headwinds we experienced in Q2 on a year-over-year basis 2023 pension income will be lower for all periods when compared to 2022. But these headwinds are expected to dissipate as we look to 2024. With respect to cash, we generated strong free cash flow in the second quarter of over $600 million, a significant increase compared to the same period last year in which we had an outflow of $460 million.This improvement was driven by increased billings and timing of collections across the company. We paid roughly $360 million of cash taxes associated with section 174. And we continue to expect a full year impact of a little over $700 million. Moving to 2023 guidance. We'll start with a few updates to our sector estimates which you can see on Slide 8, our space business continues to deliver outstanding sales growth and bookings, demonstrating the strength of its diverse portfolio capabilities. As a result, we're increasing sales guidance for space to the high $13 billion range. Remember, as recently as 2019, this business was generating revenue in the mid $7 billion range. So our guidance this year reflects a Fantastic Four year CAGR of roughly 17%.At defense systems based on the strength of their year to their year-to-date results, we're increasing our full year expectations for this business to the mid to high $5 billion range. This represents growth in the low single digit range. There are no changes to our revenue expectations at [AS or MS]. With respect to margin rates. We're maintaining our expectations for as AS, DS and MS and we're projecting a lower operating margin rate at space to reflect the rapid increase in new program winds and their first half results. At the company level, this translates to an increase to our sales guidance of $400 million in a growth rate between 4% and 6% for the full year, we're maintaining our expectations for segment operating income dollars, we expect a slightly higher full year tax rate of 17% and we reduced our projection for shares outstanding to the mid $152 millions to reflect our latest share repurchase expectations.Our EPS outlook continues to assume Q3 Closer of the sale of the minority investment for which we increased our full year EPS guidance by $0.40 last quarter. This quarter, we're increasing the lower end of our guidance range by $0.20. We remain on track with our full year outlook for cash and continue to expect to grow our free cash flow to about $3 billion by 2025. This represents a greater than 20% CAGR driven by the growth of our business and structural tailwinds from cash taxes, lower CapEx and higher CAS recoveries. In over the next five years, we see an opportunity to approximately double our current level of free cash flow. Lastly, we continue to execute our balanced capital deployment plan. This includes investments of over $2.8 billion in R&amp;D and CAPEX this year and returning excess capital to shareholders via our quarterly dividend and share repurchase plans.For the year, we continue to expect to return over 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders, including roughly $1.5 billion in share repurchases. We also plan to retire $1 billion of notes that mature in August, and we don't have any additional bond maturities until 2025. Overall, the Northrop Grumman team delivered a strong first half of the year, our business strategy is working and we're continuing to drive additional growth in sales earnings in cash. With growing global demand for a portfolio of solutions and solid program performance. We're building long term value for all our stakeholders. With that, let's open up the call for questions.See also Analysts Are Cutting Price Targets of These 10 Stocks and 20 States with the Most Craft Breweries.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

We have also covered interesting insights about female athletes and the companies who are actively supporting and investing in them. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 5 Highest-Paid Female Athletes in the World.  Long gone are the days when women's sports were confined to the shadows, overshadowed by their male counterparts. Today, female athletes are commanding attention, breaking records, and shattering glass ceilings, while their influence extends far beyond the field or court. Apart from women making contribution in athletics today, being an athlete is also one of the most profitable professions in the world.  The Fight for Equal PayFor years, the U.S. women's national soccer team fought for equal pay and treatment. This led to a truly historic moment when representatives for both the men's and women's teams signed their respective collective bargaining agreements with U.S. Soccer. The struggle for equal pay was characterized by a federal gender discrimination lawsuit filed by the women against U.S. Soccer in 2019 that drew international attention and support with fans chanting ""Equal Pay!"" during the Women's World Cup final.The women's team had been successful on the international stage, winning back-to-back World Cup titles, but faced huge disparities in FIFA prize money compared to the men's team. While the women received a $110,000 bonus for their 2019 World Cup victory, the men would have earned $407,000 had they won in 2018.After long and sometimes acrimonious negotiations, the new agreement has secured identical pay structures for appearances and tournament victories, revenue sharing, and equitable distribution of World Cup prize money. The deal involved pooling FIFA's payments for the men's World Cup and the upcoming Women's World Cup, as well as future tournaments until 2028.Story continuesHow Much Money Do Female Athletes Make?According to Forbes, in 2022, the 25 highest-paid female athletes worldwide collectively earned approximately $285 million before deductions for taxes and agents' fees. Among them, the top ten athletes contributed a large portion, amassing a total of $194 million. This figure represents a notable increase of 17% compared to the previous year's top ten, which had set a record of $167 million in 2021.On the other hand, as of 2023, Cristiano Ronaldo is the highest-paid athlete, with an estimated $136 million in earnings over the past 12 months. However, Lionel Messi was the highest paid athlete in 2021-22 with a total earning of $130 million, according to Genuine Impact Newsletter. The highest-paid athlete of all time is Michael Jordan.Companies That Actively Support and Invest in Women’s SportsNike Inc (NYSE:NKE) is a global sportswear giant that has been a frontrunner in endorsing and empowering women athletes. Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) outfitted national teams of 13 countries during the FIFA Women's World Cup, including the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand, with high-performance kits made from sustainable materials like recycled polyester and Nike Grind.Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE)’s  ""What The Football"" campaign featured 11 female footballers from around the globe which also underscores Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE)'s dedication to supporting female athletes. Moreover, Fanatics Commerce reported an 80% increase in sales of women's soccer merchandise leading up to this World Cup compared to 2019, which can be attributed to the surging interest in women's sports and the impact of Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE)’s efforts.Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) has also been a longstanding supporter of female athletes and has sponsored iconic athletes like Alex Morga. Since the inaugural FIFA Women's World Cup in 1991, they have actively contributed to the growth of women's football. With over 4 billion fans globally, football remains the most popular sport, and Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) has used its reach to empower women in sports.From Alice Coachman, the first female athlete sponsored after the 1948 Olympics, to partnerships with Simone Biles, Missy Franklin, and Michelle Kwan, the brand has paved the way for women in sports. Through initiatives like #MessageAStar, Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) has continued to inspire and support female athletes and provide opportunities for fans to engage and share their support.On the other hand, PUMA, one of the most valuable sports companies in the world, is playing an important role in helping female athletes through its partnership with Women's Agenda for the 2023 PUMA Accelerator program. The program aims to elevate the careers of 50 to 80 female athletes across Oceania. The Women's Agenda and PUMA collaboration provides free access to weekly virtual sessions over two months and features workshops with renowned trainers like tennis great Jelena Dokic, sporting physician Dr. Rachel Harris, and Nedd Brockmann who is an accomplished runner.Moreover, the brand has signed numerous top female distance athletes, including Molly Seidel, Gesa Krause, Aisha Praught-Leer, Fiona O’Keefe, and Taylor Werner.

For the two years beginning in March 2020, total deposits in the banking system swelled by 34% to $18 trillion.When the Fed began moving those rates higher to cool the economy, customers who had deposits began seeking out places with higher yields. The first year-over-year deposit decline for all banks came at the beginning of the second quarter of 2022.“Any talk of interest rates rising at this point causes people to think about whether their bank is the best place for their money,” Julia Hill, a University of Alabama law professor focused on banking, told Yahoo Finance.US banks lost $472 billion in deposits in the first quarter, according to a quarterly report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which was the largest since the FDIC began collecting quarterly industry data in 1984 and marked the fourth consecutive quarter of industry outflows.The biggest drops during that quarter belonged to certain regional banks. First Republic, for example, lost more than $100 billion and eventually was seized by regulators and sold to JPMorgan.But some banks that lost deposits during the first showed some of the biggest increases in the second.Western Alliance (WAL) and Zions (ZION) in Phoenix and Salt Lake City both showed a 7% increase in deposits. At First Horizon (FHN) in Memphis the gain was 6.4% and Comerica (CMA) in Dallas saw a 2% rise.Western Alliance was among the regional banks that gained back deposits in the second quarter.

By paying more, they are cutting into a key measure of profitability. A number of them revised down their estimates of revenue or lending profits for the rest of the year.But if these banks don’t pay up, “they can just say goodbye to depositors,” said Yokum, the CFRA analyst.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 3.0%, which is fairly typical for the industry. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo Wells Fargo's Dividend Forecasted To Be Well Covered By EarningsSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable.Wells Fargo has established itself as a dividend paying company with over 10 years history of distributing earnings to shareholders. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 30%, which means that Wells Fargo would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet.The next 3 years are set to see EPS grow by 32.0%. The future payout ratio could be 39% over that time period, according to analyst estimates, which is a good look for the future of the dividend.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.98 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.40. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 3.6% per annum over that time. We're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments the total shareholder return may be limited.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. However, Wells Fargo's EPS was effectively flat over the past five years, which could stop the company from paying more every year. While EPS growth is quite low, Wells Fargo has the option to increase the payout ratio to return more cash to shareholders.In SummaryIn summary, it's great to see that the company can raise the dividend and keep it in a sustainable range. The payout ratio looks good, but unfortunately the company's dividend track record isn't stellar. This looks like it could be a good dividend stock going forward, but we would note that the payout ratio has been at higher levels in the past so it could happen again.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

First Republic, for example, lost more than $100 billion and eventually was seized by regulators and sold to JPMorgan.But some banks that lost deposits during the first showed some of the biggest increases in the second.Western Alliance (WAL) and Zions (ZION) in Phoenix and Salt Lake City both showed a 7% increase in deposits. At First Horizon (FHN) in Memphis the gain was 6.4% and Comerica (CMA) in Dallas saw a 2% rise.Western Alliance was among the regional banks that gained back deposits in the second quarter.

FALLON via Getty Images)Even PacWest, a bank that came under intense scrutiny in the spring and agreed to merge with smaller rival Banc of California this past week, showed only a 1% decline in deposits after posting a 17% drop in the first quarter.The most aggressive deposit rates currently offered are coming from smaller commercial banks, according to Ken Tumin, a senior analyst with LendingTree who runs an online resource called DepositAccounts.com.Woburn, Mass.-based Northern Bank, the 353rd largest lender in the US with $2.8 billion in assets, currently offers a 5.6% interest on a one year CD.“A lot of these midized banks in the last several months have been more and more aggressive with deposit rates, especially with CDs,” Tumin said.This is not entirely good news for some of these smaller banks. By paying more, they are cutting into a key measure of profitability. A number of them revised down their estimates of revenue or lending profits for the rest of the year.But if these banks don’t pay up, “they can just say goodbye to depositors,” said Yokum, the CFRA analyst.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

147,306d917e-e7b3-3089-9fcd-aa69a713ebcc,PFE,2023-07-29,11 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-magic-formula-stocks-111357541.html,1690629237,STORY,"['BRK-B', 'PFE', 'JNJ', 'MRK', 'XOM']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 11 best magic formula stocks to buy now. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now.Magic Formula investing strategy was first described by legendary value investor Joel Greenblatt in his 2005 book entitled The Little Book That Beats The Market. When Greenblatt says he has a formula that beats the market, the world listens, since he has an impeccable track record. Greenblatt’s hedge fund Gotham Capital posted compound annualized returns of over 34% from 1985 through 1994. The magic formula investing strategy was apparently too simple. According to this strategy investing in top-ranked large cap stocks with strong high earnings yield and a high return on invested capital (ROIC) beats the market.Magic Formula: Too Simple to be True?Joel Greenblatt was aware that this strategy sounded too good and simple to be true. That’s why in his book he repeatedly asks the reader the question that what is the guarantee, if any, that this magic formula investing strategy actually works and is not just a random fluke? After sharing a lot of historical data to prove how the magic formula investing strategy actually works over longer periods of time, Greenblatt begins to address the question about the timelessness of this strategy.“…In order for the magic formula to make us money in the long run, the principles behind it must appear not only sensible and logical, but timeless. Otherwise, there is no way we’ll be able to “hang on” when our short-term results turn against us. As simple as it may seem, knowing that two plus two always equals four can be a pretty powerful concept. No matter how many people tell us differently, no matter how long they tell us, and no matter how smart all those people appear to be, we are unlikely to waver in our conviction. In a similar way, our level of confidence in the magic formula will determine whether we can hang on to a strategy that may be both unpopular and unsuccessful for seemingly long periods of time.”Story continuesThe Link Between Return on Capital and Earnings GrowthGreenblatt then goes on to establish the link between high return on capital and earnings growth. He expands his concept of return on capital and says if a business is posting high return on capital and plans to invest all or major chunk of those returns to expand the same business, there’s a high chance that the business in question will keep growing its earnings. The magic formula investing strategy, Greenblatt emphasizes repeatedly, does not promote investing in companies with average return on capital let alone poor return on capital. The strategy makes a ranking system that looks for top companies with highest return on capital and earnings yield. This way, if a business has high return on capital and earnings yield that means the business has some kind of advantage over its competitors that it can maintain in the future as well.Joel Greenblatt repeatedly acknowledges that the magic formula investing strategy might not work in several instances and performs poorly in many situations especially when the holding period is short. He emphasizes the importance of holding stocks and why it’s easier said than done:“Most people just won’t wait that long. Their investment time horizon is too short. If a strategy works in the long run (meaning it sometimes takes three, four, or even five years to show its stuff), most people won’t stick with it. After a year or two of performing worse than the market averages (or earning lower returns than their friends), most people look for a new strategy— usually one that has done well over the past few years. Even professional money managers who believe their strategy will work over the long term have a hard time sticking with it. After a few years of poor performance relative to the market or to their competitors, the vast majority of clients and investors just leave! That’s why it’s hard to stay with a strategy that doesn’t follow along with everyone else’s.”Value underperformed for several years before it made a comeback with a vengeance when inflation, rate hikes and highly volatile geopolitical situation started to crush the global financial markets. While Joel Greenblatt has always been a fan of value investing, he’d already started to adapt a hybrid investing strategy to take up passive investing to make up for value underperformance. In a 2017 report, Bloomberg reported how Gotham Asset Management was inculcating index trading. The report at the time quoted Greenblatt who said:“It’s a hybrid that answers a lot of the questions that active management has failed to answer,” he said. “This strategy will dwarf them over time.”The Bloomberg report said that Greenblatt’s hedge fund introduced Gotham Index Plus in 2015. The intention behind this step was simple: instead of putting all capital in active management, put some in the S&amp;P 500 index and then invest in stocks they consider undervalued and short those they believe will fall.11 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy NowJoel Greenblatt of Gotham Asset ManagementOur MethodologyFor this article, we used Joel Greenblatt’s Q1’ 2023 portfolio and picked his top 11 stock holdings.Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now11.

If you want to skip a primer on small cap investing and want to jump ahead to the top five stocks in this piece, then head on over to 5 Best Small Cap Pharma Stocks to Buy. The pharmaceutical industry is one that has profited a lot from the computing revolution. Throughout the years, and especially in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, a handful of biotechnology stocks have soared. For instance, BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), one of the manufacturers of the coronavirus vaccine, has seen its shares jump by 661% in the past five years despite the fact that they are now trading at roughly $105 - levels significantly below the late 2021 peak which saw the share price touch nearly $400. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s shares have grown by slightly less, but like BioNTech, have dropped from what were perhaps record high levels in 2021.On a broader level, the pharmaceutical industry is made up of both biotechnology companies and giants such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). These companies have market capitalizations in hundreds of billions of dollars and they sell pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products. And quite interestingly, the returns of the biotechnology and the pharmaceutical sector have been nearly similar over the past two decades or so. The iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB), which has been trading since early 2001 is up by roughly 280% since then while the iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (NASDAQ:IHE) has gained close to 265% since 2006. During the same time period, the S&amp;P500 index has returned roughly 214% since 200 - implying that the two exchanged traded funds that broadly target the biotechnology and the pharmaceutical companies have somewhat outpaced a broader collection of well running firms in lucrative industries.This out performance by the pharmaceutical sector comes despite the fact that Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is actually trading below the levels it was trading at the turn of the century in 2000 as its stock was hovering around $40 in 1999 but is currently trading around $36. Pfizer, like other firms, also benefited from the heightened interest in the medicine industry after the coronavirus pandemic, especially since its vaccine demonstrated high efficacy in combating the virus. Yet, even as Pfizer's share price is wrought with cyclicality, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)'s shares have gained more than 600% since 2000 - so if you had invested a $1,000 in the stock back then, your money would have been worth $6,000 by now.Story continuesSince it is both a stable and a highly growing sector at the same time, the pharma industry is made up of all types of firms. Some of these heavily invest in research and development and operational expansion while others payout dividends. Dividend stocks offer a nice advantage of an added payout from the stock which can either be reinvested or used elsewhere. Our take on the 12 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy in 2023 shows that the dividend yields in the sector for stocks that hedge funds have piled into can range between 5.4% to 0.6% with most of the values ranging around 3%.As a whole, the pharmaceutical industry was slated to be worth a massive $1.5 trillion in 2022 and it is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% to sit at $2.1 trillion by the end of 2026. The sector is expected to benefit from a growth in global population age as more seniors and others require regular medication for everyday diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. This growth is projected despite the relatively stringent regulatory requirement for some hot sectors such as precision medicine which have seen 450 drugs withdrawn since the late 90s due to adverse reactions.Our detailed take on the pharmaceutical industry highlights growth and disruption areas, with generics posed to threaten the position of established companies and revolutionizing treatments for previously un treatable ailments such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) changing the landscape of global medicine and promising products that were once thought to be unachievable. As to how generics threaten the position of established companies, well, once the patents expire the same medicines are manufactured by several other firms which reduces prices and steals market share from the incumbents.Small cap stocks are some of the trickier investments since while the low share price has the potential for explosive share price growth, the stock can be liquid and cause equally large losses. Several financial executives have shared their belief that 2023 might be the year for small cap investing. For instance, Jonathan Boyar of Boyar Value believes that the small cap sector was one of the cheapest in the market in February, while Bank of America's head of small cap strategy echoed similar sentiments during the time when she shared that in the case of a recessionary downturn, small cap stocks might provide greater downside protection when compared to large cap stocks.As to what's in store for the pharma sector, here's what the management of Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) had to say during the firm's Q1 2023 earnings call:In Q1, revenue declined 11% versus Q1 2022. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenues increased 10% or 12% on a constant currency basis, highlighting solid momentum for our business despite a substantial headwind from a loss of exclusivity in the United States, which did not yet face meaningful generic competition in the base period. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 230 basis points to 78.4% in Q1 2023. The increase in gross margin percent was driven primarily by lower sales of COVID-19 antibodies, partially offset by lower realized prices. Total operating expenses increased 15% this quarter.Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12%, driven by higher marketing and selling expenses associated with recent and upcoming product launches and indications. R&amp;D expenses increased 23%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets. This quarter, we recognized acquired IP R&amp;D charges of $105 million or $0.10 of EPS. In Q1 2022, acquired IP R&amp;D and development milestone charges totaled $166 million or $0.15 of EPS. Operating income decreased 38% in Q1, driven by lower revenue, primarily due to 0 sales of COVID-19 antibodies this quarter, paired with higher R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 23% for the quarter and reflected a negative impact of approximately 150 basis points attributable to acquired IP R&amp;D charges.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some great small cap pharma stocks out of which the top picks are Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. (NASDAQ:COLL), Pacira BioSciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:PCRX), and Supernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SUPN).10 Best Small Cap Pharma Stocks to BuyM. A.

Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.13 billion.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at CER.Rise in Product SalesProduct sales rose 5% at CER to $10.9 billion, driven by sales of its non-COVID products. Product sales beat our estimates of $10.6 billion.Among AstraZeneca’s various therapeutic areas, Oncology product sales were up 25%.

Sales of other medicines declined 23%.During the quarter, AstraZeneca recorded collaboration revenues of $193 million. Alliance revenues were up more than 200% year over year to $341 million, driven by continued growth in revenues from partnered medicines.Sales of Some Key DrugsIn Oncology, Tagrisso recorded sales of $1.49 billion, up 10% year over year on strong demand as a first line and adjuvant treatment. In China, sales benefitted from rising patient demand, which offset the National reimbursement drug list (NRDL) renewal price reductions. Though Tagrisso sales met the Zacks Consensus Estimate, it slightly missed our model estimate of $1.55 billion.Imfinzi generated sales of $1.08 billion in the quarter, up 58% year over year, driven by increased use in biliary tract, liver and lung cancers. Product sales from Imjudo were included in the Imfinzi line. Imfinzi sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $922 million and $843 million, respectively.Story continuesLynparza product revenues rose 9% year over year to $717 million, owing to usage growth in all approved cancer indications. Increased use in first-line HRD-positive ovarian cancer and higher uptake for an expanded label in breast and prostate cancers boosted sales in Europe. However, Lynparza sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $756 million and $845 million, respectively.AstraZeneca markets Lynparza in partnership with Merck MRK. The profit-sharing deal between AstraZeneca and Merck was inked in 2017. AstraZeneca &amp; Merck’s Lynparza is approved for four cancer types, namely ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic. In addition to Lynparza, the deal included Koselugo.Calquence generated sales of $653 million in the quarter, up 34% year over year, benefiting from the increased new patient market share.

However, sales of Zoladex rose 5% in the quarter.In CVRM, Farxiga recorded product sales of $1.51 billion in the quarter, up 41% year over year, reflecting volume growth across all regions and growth of the SGLT2 inhibitor class in general.

In Emerging markets, Farxiga is witnessing growth in Emerging Markets. Farxiga sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38 billion and our model estimate of $1.42 billion.Brilinta/Brilique sales were $331 million in the reported quarter, down 3% year over year, due to an unfavourable gross-to-net adjustment. While sales in Europe were affected by clawbacks, sales declined in Canada due to generic erosion.In R&amp;I, Symbicort sales rose 1% in the quarter to $600 million. Pulmicort sales rose 13% to $124 million. The upside in both drugs were driven by strong growth in Emerging Markets.Fasenra recorded sales of $406 million in the quarter, up 16% year over year, driven by increased market share performance in Europe and the United States due to market leadership.

AstraZeneca’s RSV antibody Synagis recorded $87 million as revenues, which were up 16% year over year, driven by an early start to RSV season in Japan.Profit DiscussionAstraZeneca’s core gross margin of 82.4% was up 2 percentage points at CER as the dilutive effect from profit-sharing arrangements were offset by a positive mix due to increased contribution from oncology and rare disease medicines. COVID-19 medications, which were dilutive to gross margin, declined substantially in the quarter, thereby improving the company’s gross margin mix. Core selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8% to $3.30 billion.Core research and development expenses rose 8% to $2.57 billion.

The company also maintained its 2023 outlook despite declining sales of its COVID products.Shares of AstraZeneca were up 4.4% in pre-market trading on Jul 28 due to the better-than-expected Q2 earnings results despite declining sales from COVID-19 therapies.In the year so far, the stock has increased 0.5% compared with the industry’s 1.8% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAstraZeneca noted that product sale improvement in China can be attributed to increased patient demand, which is expected to offset the pricing pressure associated with NRDL and VBP programs.AstraZeneca PLC Price AstraZeneca PLC PriceAstraZeneca PLC price | AstraZeneca PLC Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, AstraZeneca has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

If you want to skip our primer on the stock market and the economy, then head on over to What Are The Best Stocks To Buy Right Now? Top 5 Stocks. When it comes to the turmoil in the U.S. economy that kicked off with the coronavirus pandemic and was extended due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, July 2023 has been the climaxing month. The start of the month saw investors wait with bated breaths about a crucial jobs report that would have provided the first signal about the Federal Reserve's plans for future interest rate hikes. While the central bank had nearly penciled in a 25 basis point interest rate increase for July, the concern surrounded future decisions, especially for the next meeting in September. The month started off with rather shocking private payrolls report that nearly took the wind out of the rally in the first half of 2023, as the data showed that more than twice the number of jobs were added than analysts were actually expecting.This shock was followed by new jobs data from the Labor Department that actually undershot expectations and provided a breather to analysts and investors. Then, inflation for June also saw a cooling off and led to the annual figure sitting at 3% and ending up being below the Dow Jones consensus estimates of 3.1%. However, more drama was in store for investors as July's final week settled in. This was in the form of two additional data sets that enabled an understanding of how far the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have made it into the economy and whether there is any justification for the Fed to even consider raising rates in September or later.The first data set was the GDP growth report from the Commerce Department. This report, like several others before it, provided a conflicting set of conclusions. On a positive note, it showed that the American economy grew by 2.4% in the second quarter with the growth accelerating from 2% in the first quarter. It added that price indexes also grew at a slower pace, lending credence to the belief that no further hikes might be required since inflation is cooling. The second quarter GDP growth data was met by another data release again from the Commerce Department. This was the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index which is also the Fed's favorite inflation tool. Prior to the release, economists were expecting the core PCE to sit at 4.2% annually and 0.3% over the month, and the data met these estimates. The pure PCE, namely prices that also include food and energy, stood at 3% in June, for the slowest pace in two years, and provided a lot of respite to jittery currency markets in particular as all major currencies gained against the U.S. dollar.Story continuesWhile the pure PCE is the Fed's favorite inflation metric, the central bank also monitors the labor and jobs market through several reports. One of these is the Employment Cost Index from the Labor Department. It revealed that civilian compensation costs in America rose by just 1% in Q2 2023 - for the slowest pace of increase since the second quarter of 2021. Annually, in June 2023, wages grew by 4.6% in June, slowing down from 5% in the first quarter. Combined, this data set shows that wage pressures are slowing down, and opens up hope for this trend to continue in the future to bring down inflation and not tip the economy into a recession.So, what's going on in the stock market now that the clouds finally might be disappearing? Well, the market, as you might know, has been on a tear this year. The NASDAQ 100 index closed Friday after gaining 1.85%, while the NASDAQ Composite, the S&amp;P500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) were up 1.90%, 0.99%, and 0.50%, respectively. This brings the year to date gains of the NASDAQ 100 to an exact 45% - and at a time when many had predicted that American economic output might be on the decline. As to whether this market optimism is warranted, Brent Schutte, the chief investment officer of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management believes that those that have made money on the market are done by now and the recent euphoria comes from folks who missed out on the fireworks during H1 2023.He simply put his sentiment as:Those same people who are probably piling in right now were wrong about their outlook nine months ago and now they’re reversing course. I’m pushing in the opposite direction. The equity market will have some difficult months ahead.So, in a market where most people are confused about what's really going on for months, the true question is which stocks should one buy.

On Jul 26, the Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5.25-5.5%. This marked the highest range of the Fed fund rate since March 2001. Notably, since March 2022, the central bank hiked its interest rate in 10 consecutive FOMC meetings.Prices of cryptocurrencies are inversely related to the market interest rate. The primary reason for last year’s disappointment was the Fed’s decision to pursue stringent monetary policies and a rigorous hike in the benchmark interest rate to combat 40-year high inflation.Cryptocurrencies have resumed their northward journey this year after a highly disappointing 2022. However, after the Fed hiked the rate again, prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) fell 0.8%, 0.9%, 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively.Cryptocurrencies may face volatility in the near-term as the central bank said that the decision of the future rate hike will depend solely on economic data. At this stage, investors should accumulate cryptocurrencies using a buy-on-the-dip strategy. Every dip in crypto prices will be a good purchasing point in order to gain handsomely once the Fed’s tighter monetary control comes to an end.Stocks In FocusNVIDIA Corp.

The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at International Business Machines’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines Is International Business Machines Still Cheap?Good news, investors! International Business Machines is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $181.80, but it is currently trading at US$143 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. International Business Machines’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.What kind of growth will International Business Machines generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for International Business Machines. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since IBM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on IBM for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy IBM. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Home Depot, Inc., Philip Morris International Inc. and IBM Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Home Depot have lagged rival Lowe's (+4.3% vs. +17.5%) and the broader market (+4.3% vs. +20.1% for the S&amp;P 500 index) in the year-to-date period, reflecting worries about the retailer's exposure to cyclical forces.That said, the company has been witnessing significant benefits from the execution of the ""One Home Depot"" investment plan, which focuses on expanding supply chain facilities, technology investments and enhancement to the digital experience.The interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have helped consistently boost web traffic for the past few quarters. The company remains on track with its strategic investments to build a Pro ecosystem.However, HD posted dismal first-quarter fiscal 2023 performance. Results were impacted by a more broad-based pressure across the business, driven by softened demand versus expectations. A deflation in lumber prices and unfavorable weather have also hurt the results. HD also provided a conservative view for fiscal 2023.(You can read the full research report on Home Depot here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Philip Morris have outperformed the Zacks Tobacco industry over the past year (+7.0% vs. +5.0%). The company has been benefiting from its solid pricing power. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company's performance in the second quarter of 2023 and is likely to remain a driver.A focus on reduced-risk products, especially IQOS, has been working well for the company, which is witnessing a continued product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products. These upsides are likely to boost organic revenues in the full-year 2023.However, Philip Morris has been battling cost-related headwinds. The company expects to make additional growth-oriented investments in 2023, which may impact margins. Also, soft cigarette shipment volumes and volatile currency movements have been concerns. In full-year 2023, cigarette shipment volumes are expected to decline by 1.5-2.5%.(You can read the full research report on Philp Morris here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of IBM have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (+15.7% vs. +12.3%). The company is witnessing solid net sales growth in the software segment driven by healthy hybrid cloud adoption and solid demand trends across RedHat, automation, data in AI and security.Strong foundation of research and innovation, a broad portfolio that caters to various industry requirements and diverse global market presence set it apart from its competitors. IBM is also poised to benefit from the Watsonx platform.However, declining trends in the infrastructure vertical are hurting top-line growth. Intense competition from other established players in cloud services is putting pressure on margins.

QuoteSegmental DiscussionProximity Americas: Total revenues for the segment rose 19.9% year over year to Ps. 72,099 million (US$4,205.5 million). The increase can primarily be attributed to a 15.3% rise in same-store sales on 7.4% growth each in store traffic and average ticket. The gains mainly stemmed from robust growth across the OXXO categories due to the rising demand for thirst and gathering occasions, such as beer, snacks, and other beverages. The results also benefited from the rise in mobility-driven occasions due to continued recovery across markets.The Proximity Americas division had 22,059 OXXO stores as of Jun 30, 2023. Operating income accelerated 18% year over year. The operating margin for the segment declined 20 bps to 10%, owing to higher operating expenses.Proximity Europe: Total revenues for the segment was Ps. 10,833 million (US$631.9 million).

The company reaffirming its plans to produce 400,000 EVs through the first half of 2024, and 1 million by the end of 2025.PAUL JACOBSON: We're talking about double EV production in the second half of the year. And momentum is building. We've known this for a little while now. When you combine it with the tangible results, I think it's a great story for investors as well.Story continues- Shares of Ford in after hours here, up on the back of their latest quarterly results.TOM NARAYAN: If you dig into the numbers, definitely good margins out of-- especially the blue segment and pro especially.- Second quarter results showed a slowdown in its electric vehicles. The automaker now expects full-year losses in its Model e unit to hit $4.5 billion. Previously, it saw losses of $3 billion.TOM NARAYAN: In the long run though, '24 or '25, I do see EV adoption pick up. So it's something that they're going to have to find an answer for eventually.- All of that considered, I think there's a major opportunity for investors to continue to evaluate where some of the pro market demand is here and where Ford can really accelerate, even within its EV business where some of the crossover between that pro-business is and where their advancements in electrifying the broader fleet.]"

However, the results that Ford reported on Thursday were the result of strong pricing and the demand for its internal combustion engine vehicles. Meanwhile, its EV transformation is going slower than expected and therefore, Ford isn’t getting any closer to challenging the dominance of the EV king, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).Second Quarter HighlightsThe Blue Oval automaker generated $45 billion in revenue during the April to June quarter, which translates to a 12% YoY rise. The revenue increase included a 39% rise in the EV business with automotive revenue amounting to $42.43 billion and topping the expected $40.38 billion.Ford earned a net income of $1.92 billion, or 47 cents per share, substantially up last year’s comparable quarter when it earned $667 million, or 16 cents per share. Adjusted EBIT jumped from last year’s $3.72 billion to $3.79 billion while adjusted margin melted from 9.3% to 8.4%. Adjusted EPS amounted to 72 cents, significantly topping the expected 55 cents.SegmentsThis was the second quarterly report in which Ford broke down its financial results by business units.Ford Blue that covers the traditional business operations earned $2.31 billion while Ford Pro commercial business earned $2.39 billion. However, the EV unit lost $1.08 billion.Uplifted 2023 guidance but also a warning of a greater EV lossFord is now expecting full-year adjusted earnings to be between $11 billion and $12 billion, improving the previously guided range between $9 billion and $11 billion. Adjusted free cash flow has also been lifted from $6 billion to a range between $6.5 billion to $7 billion.As for the EV business, Ford is now expecting to lose $4.5 billion as it warned of slower than expected adoption. It previously anticipated roughly $3 billion. Capital expenditures are expected within the $8 billion and $9 billion range.Story continuesSlow EV Progress Overshadowed The Q2 BeatAlso on Thursday, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson evaluated Ford’s EV production growth a disappointing, while also warning that labor negotiations with the United Auto Workers are another reason for caution. Ford CEO Jim Farley admitted that the legendary automaker has more work to do in order to do, specifically aimed at reducing costs, improving quality and streamlining its operations. On a more positive note, Farley also said that persisting supply chain disruptions are now easing. During the reported quarter, Ford dropped the price of its electric F-150 pickup, following the discounting footsteps of Tesla to boost demand. Ford also joined the Tesla charging network, gaining access to the best EV charging infrastrucutre and technology. But it's still nowhere near to challenging Tesla on the EV front.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the solid-state battery market and explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 3 Cheap Solid State Battery Stocks to Buy.The lithium-ion batteries commonly utilized in smartphones and electric vehicles (EVs) currently available in the market are predominantly liquid-state batteries. These batteries employ a liquid electrolyte solution to facilitate the movement of ions between the cathode (positive) and anode (negative), resulting in the generation of electrical potential. In contrast, solid-state batteries, as implied by their name, eliminate the liquid electrolyte and substitute it with a solid material such as ceramics or glass. This shift to a solid substance enables the functioning of the battery. According to a research report by Allied Market Research, the global solid-state battery market size was valued at $0.5 billion in 2020, and is projected to reach $3.4 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 18% from 2021 to 2030.The advantages of solid-state batteries are twofold. Firstly, they offer enhanced safety compared to liquid-state batteries, which are susceptible to hazardous failures when damaged. Secondly, and of significant importance to electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, removing the liquid component from batteries allows for increased electrical generation capacity. The technology has achieved significant advancement in recent years.This battery technology has also caught the eye of the U.S. government and the aviation industry. This past year, NASA's Solid-state Architecture Batteries for Enhanced Rechargeability and Safety (SABERS) team successfully developed a high-performing solid-state battery with the potential to store ample electricity and discharge it rapidly, making it a promising candidate for efficiently powering electric aircraft. Regarding this breakthrough, Rocco Viggiano, principal investigator for SABERS at NASA’s Glenn Research Center made the following remarks:Story continues“We’re starting to approach this new frontier of battery research that could do so much more than lithium-ion batteries can. Not only does this design eliminate 30 to 40 percent of the battery’s weight, it also allows us to double or even triple the energy it can store, far exceeding the capabilities of lithium-ion batteries that are considered to be state of the art ”Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), the automotive giant, has made significant strides in solid-state battery technology, proclaiming a ""technological breakthrough"" that could revolutionize the range capabilities of their electric vehicles (EVs). According to Toyota's assertions, advancements in aerodynamics, design, and battery technology will enable their EVs to travel over twice the distance of current models, covering a remarkable 1,200 kilometers on a single charge. Additionally, they anticipate a quick recharge time of 10 minutes or less. The company plans to introduce these advancements to the market between 2027 and 2028, aiming for a commercial rollout. They further express optimism that ongoing research could extend the cruising range even further, reaching an impressive 1,500 kilometers on a single charge. By comparison, the long-range version of the Tesla Model 3 currently offers a range of 602 kilometers.While relatively new and emerging compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries, solid-state batteries are set to generate hefty profits if the aforementioned developments are anything to go by. This becomes more evident when we factor the various ambitious goals that certain EV makers have set for themselves. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) has set an ambitious target to manufacture 1 million electric vehicles annually by 2025. Similarly, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) aims to produce 2 million electric vehicles per year by 2026. Meanwhile, Volkswagen's vision is even bolder, aiming for 80% of EV sales in Europe and 55% in the U.S. by 2030.6 Cheap Solid State Battery Stocks to BuyPhoto by Kumpan Electric on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of cheap solid-state battery stocks to buy, we shortlisted 6 stocks that are either directly involved in the solid-state batteries, or are set to benefit from the technology's growth. We made use of the Finviz stock screener to list down stocks that have P/E ratios less than 20 (as of July 25). Typically, the average P/E ratio is around 20 to 25. Anything below that would be considered a good price-to-earnings ratio, whereas anything above that would be a worse P/E ratio. Data from around 943 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the first quarter of 2023 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.You have to keep in mind that this is an emerging technology, and it may be completely replaced by a superior technology at a future point, or abandoned in favor of the current lithium-ion batteries.

This comes after Ford's second-quarter earnings beat, forecasting a slower-than-expected EV adoption into 2024. Yahoo Finance Live examines the pricing of Ford's Model E and compares the outlook for other EV automakers.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Let's talk about Ford because those shares are moving lower after its second quarter results showed a slowdown in its electric vehicles. The automaker now expects full year losses in its Model E unit to hit $4 and 1/2 billion. Previously, it saw losses of $3 billion. Ford CEO Jim Farley saying in a statement that, quote, ""EV adoption will be a little slower than expected.And in another blow to the company, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said this morning, Ford is recalling over 870,000 of its F-150 trucks due to risks with its electric parking brake. So it doesn't seem like that is a huge issue, but it's a high number of vehicles. And it's their best selling vehicle, so something to keep in mind here.What's so interesting to me here with Ford in this EV story is that effectively all of the EV makers, not just Ford, but Ford seems to be showing a lot of stress from this, you know, people don't want to spend as much on this stuff. They might want electric vehicles, but they don't want to pay what they see as overpay or too premium of a price for electric vehicles. So that seems to be the crux of the issue here. Everybody from Ford to Tesla is up against it, but some of the automakers are managing it better than others.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. The recall, of course, some of the big news this morning and coming off of the earnings. One thing that really stuck out to me was this pro line of business too. The margins that they're seeing in that part of the business and on a dollar basis, at least, kind of far outpacing what you're seeing across some of the Model E and even the ICE business that lingers as well.Story continuesAll that considered, I think there's a major opportunity for investors to continue to evaluate where some of the pro market demand is here and where Ford can really accelerate for even within its EV business, where some of the crossover between that pro-business is and where their advancements in electrifying the broader fleet with regard to larger contracts that they're going to be able to take on could be in the future here.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. I mean that pro line is all well and good, but people want to see this big EV bet delivering and paying off, and it's not happening here. The company says it's still trying to make an 8% return on battery powered models before interest and taxes in 3 and 1/2 years. But it didn't seem too convinced of that forecast. And that's also something now that analysts, investors are questioning.BRAD SMITH: I remember all the hype around the Ford Lightning. I still want to try out a ride in the Ford Lightning.JULIE HYMAN: So you look cool.BRAD SMITH: The Lightning, the GM Hummer out there, got to try them all.JULIE HYMAN: Rivian.BRAD SMITH: The Rivian, yes! The R1T, yeah. All right. Well, cool. We'll take a ride this weekend.]"

GM, Unum Group UNM, StoneCo Ltd. STNE and Affiliated Managers Group AMG.5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks to Add to Your PortfolioPrice-to-book ratio or P/B ratio is essentially the ratio of stock price to book value, i.e. how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.In value investing, it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong. There are a number of investment styles for finding great stocks at attractive values.While considering valuation metrics, though price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are the first choices, the P/B ratio is also emerging as a convenient tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.Here's the formula for P/B ratio:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Magna International, General Motors Co., Unum Group,StoneCo Ltd. and Affiliated Managers Group are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.Understanding Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company's balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders' equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company's balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.Story continuesA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock's price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Aurora, Canada, Magna International is a manufacturer and supplier of complete automotive components.

SAM reported second-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While the top line declined from the year-ago quarter, the bottom line increased. The performance mainly reflected strong growth in Twisted Tea, offset by continuing challenges in the hard seltzer category.Boston Beer witnessed improvements in financial performance and volume, bolstered by the timely occurrence of the July 4th holiday. This positive outcome is a result of the consistent execution of operational plans.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 0.9% in the past three months against the industry’s 0.5% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings per share of $4.72 in second-quarter 2023 increased 9.5% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.45.

This was partly offset by higher brand investments of $10.2 million mainly related to investments in consulting, as well as elevated salary and benefit costs. Our model estimated these expenses to decline 1.2% to $153 million in the quarter under review.General and administrative expenses rose 15.6% year over year to $44.9 million mainly due to increased consulting and legal costs, and higher salaries and benefits costs.Story continuesFinancialsAs of Jul 1, 2023, Boston Beer had cash and cash equivalents of $207.8 million, and total stockholders’ equity of $1,087.2 million.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the logistics industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Logistics Stocks to Buy.According to Precedence Research, the size of the logistics industry stood at $10.68 trillion at the end of 2022. The industry is set to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.48% to reach a size of $18.23 trillion by 2032. Meanwhile, London, UK-based professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) estimates that the logistics industry generates an estimated annual revenue of $4.6 trillion. Presently, the North American region dominates the logistics industry. The logistics industry can be broadly categorized into three notable groups based on their business models. A first-party logistics (1PL) provider is a basic form of logistics management where a company or organization handles its own logistics operations internally. A second-party logistics (2PL) provider comes into play when a company engages in a direct logistics partnership with another company. Meanwhile, a third-party logistics (3PL) provider is a dedicated entity that handles the transportation, inventory management, warehousing, and other services for any company.One of the main drivers in the growth of the global logistics industry is the boom in the e-commerce industry. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the contribution of e-commerce sales as part of total retail sales from 16% to 19% in 2020. Leading e-commerce companies like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), and PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) experienced their top-line increase by 70% between 2019 and 2021 and the total share of these prominent e-commerce platforms as a percentage of total global e-commerce sales increased from 75% in 2019 to 80% in 2021.  Such dynamic growth in the e-commerce industry has resulted in some of the biggest global logistics and shipping companies expanding their operations and investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), automated warehouses, the Internet of Things (IoT), predictive analysis, and real-time tracking.Story continuesThe logistics industry is anticipated to experience tailwinds as road connectivity in developing countries is now improving. This improvement in road connectivity is expected to offer greater upside potential to the best transportation stocks, such as CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX), FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP). One notable measure intended to give a boost to the industry is the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), also known as the New Silk Road, launched by China in 2013. The initiative includes a wide network of highways and railroads expanding into former Soviet countries in the West. Meanwhile, in the South, China intends to expand this network through its neighboring countries, Pakistan and India. China has been able to reach agreements with 147 countries of the world that are responsible for contributing two-thirds of the global gross domestic product (GDP). The biggest component of the BRI is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), with an estimated cost of $62 billion. To date, China has spent over $1 trillion on the BRI, with experts believing that the total outlay could reach $8 trillion by the time of completion. Investors seeking opportunities in the logistics sector are considering investing in trucking stocks with dividends and freight stocks.11 Best Logistics Stocks to BuyTravel mania/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe used Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 to shortlist the 11 best logistics stocks.

Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) from $200 to $207 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst anticipates modestly improving trends for the trucking industry during the second half of this year. There is a widespread belief that the truckload-levered transporters will see a bottom in Q2 2023.Wedgewood Partners shared its stance on J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“As we continue to familiarize our clients with our SMID portfolio’s holdings, we would like to discuss our significant exposure to the U.S. Transportation industry. We currently have three transportation holdings and have been substantially overweight the industry in comparison to the Russell 2500 index for several years. While these undoubtedly are cyclical business models, we see many long-term tailwinds for the domestic Transportation industry, which will provide attractive growth levels and will allow these companies to improve their returns on investment over time.J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) is the country’s largest independent provider of intermodal transportation services, with smaller businesses in trucking and logistics. Intermodal transportation refers to freight deliveries that require the use of more than one “mode” of transportation, most often including some combination of ocean, railroad, and truck between source and destination. J.B. Hunt generally provides the rail portion of these intermodal loads.J.B. Hunt benefited from the exacerbated shortage in Truckload capacity in both their intermodal business—where they could directly substitute railroad service for people who weren’t able to find TL capacity—and in their smaller, but rapidly growing Dedicated TL division, where the company takes over all or a portion of a shipping customer’s trucking fleet. While customers were paying significantly higher prices and still struggling to find any trucking capacity, they found it very attractive to contract for a dedicated, outsourced fleet with J.B. Hunt.”6. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Dollar Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $571,041,000Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.

And Josh, let's start with the first one and that's Roku that's closing the day up shares moving to the upside of 31%, rallying on better than expected earnings results here from the company.And Josh, I think there was lots of questions going into this report about whether or not Roku was going to hold up given all the macro pressures. Questions about the ad market exactly what that is going to do to Roku but again beating the Street's expectations here, and investors seem to be pretty excited about this.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Seana, it really comes down to just a couple of simple numbers here When you look at Roku what they did in the first quarter versus what they did in the second quarter. So first quarter, ad revenue was down 1% year over year, so it was down compared to the year prior.Fast forward to this quarter, the quarter they just reported for, Roku's ad revenue was up 11% year over year. That's just a massive jump, and a jump that I don't think people were fully expecting because, as you said, people have not felt that good about the ad market. There still is questions about the health of the ad market, but it is some positive signs.And one other note that I wanted to highlight there is just getting costs down. Their operation costs down 8% here. It had been up 42% year over year in the prior quarter. So just to be able to manage costs seems like a key thing that investors are focused on here. Again, people still wondering how that macro backdrop is going to affect Roku in the second half of the year, but maybe once those sort of storm clouds clear a little bit, might be better.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah, we know getting costs under control huge focal point here for investors, especially what we're seeing play out within this sector. A couple of other data points here that stuck out to me in this earnings report, active customer accounts that was up 16% on a year-over-year basis at 73.5 million streaming hours, up 21% from a year ago at 21 or 25.1 billion. Average revenue per user, though, that was off nearly 8% on a year-over-year basis, so some cause for concern there at least for Roku.JOSH SCHAFER: And then I want to take a look at the energy giants too, Exxon and Chevron following today. Exxon missing the Street's expectations in Q2 profits with profits declining 56% since last year. Now, Chevron posted a loss earlier this week, a 48% drop in earnings down from a year ago, but it did beat the Street's expectations. The two oil giants losing a combined $15.5 billion in profits since last year, Seana.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Certainly some worrisome trends here for Exxon, and we're seeing that pressure on the stock off just about 1%. The CEO Darren Woods trying to put a positive spin on this call saying that it was nearly twice when it comes to their earnings work right now.Nearly twice what they made in the second quarter of 2018. That doubling of earnings reflects our work in the intervening years to reshape our portfolio of businesses, invest in advanced products, also drive a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness.Lots of focus when it comes to Exxon and their presence within the Permian Basin. They also announced a record production effort in that region. It's on track here for overall growth of about 10% this year, but clearly, they have been under pressure as we've seen.The price of crude under pressure, below 80 bucks a barrel. Certainly, a headwind here for these larger oil giants.JOSH SCHAFER: Right. And I thought it was interesting too. You mentioned Chevron started pointing out some positives in the quarter, so, I mean, the stock wasn't down that much, right? We're not talking about a massive loss here. And I thought-- their CFO had an interesting comment to Reuters also pointing out that if you look at just earnings and profits, they haven't had this good of a quarter. If you took out their second quarter last year, it's their best second quarter since 2011. So really probably maybe they're not that disappointed in the quarter.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and they're up against very, very tough comps when we're comparing it to what we heard from Exxon back in 2022. All right, let's also take a look at Intel ending the day higher. The company's latest earnings results relaying a gain of just over 6%, one of the top performers in the Dow.Intel showing some signs that it did return to profitability after two straight quarters of losses. CEO Pat Gelsinger attributing the boost to a recovery in PC sales. He also said that the AI boom could potentially help drive sales even higher from here. Clearly, Intel has really struggled with the slowing growth or really the slowdown that we've seen across the board when it comes to the PC market.So this report really pointed to the fact that maybe the PC market had bottomed in the second quarter, and we're looking for that recovery to hopefully, at least in Gelsinger's eyes, he was very confident that it's going to pick up some steam here in the second half.JOSH SCHAFER: That's the key word here is bottom, right? That's a lot of times what you're looking for in these different calls depending on what the metric that was falling is people want to find that bottom because then it means things are probably going to go up, right?So Intel highlighting that PC inventory correction has likely ended, and they're going to come into a positive period there. Also I thought it was interesting again talking about OpEx and just savings. They're talking a lot about being able to save over the next couple of years and fixing that cost structure, which is something that people have been very focused on too.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, they've been very focused on. It certainly seems like the Street was encouraged by these results, although some still a bit hesitant. Oppenheimer was out with a note just commenting on these results saying that they are going to remain on the sidelines as the company's turnaround plans play out. So they're encouraged by the results that they did see this latest quarter, but they also want to see what the numbers look like for the current quarter, and then, of course, as we look ahead to the end of the year.All right, well, we are halfway through the second quarter of earnings. Let's check in on some of the biggest winners and losers so far. And Josh, we got to start off with what we've seen play out in the tech sector so far. And two of the names that stuck out to both of us this week was Meta and Snap. And what we heard from these two names was an extremely different story. Where do you want to start with?JOSH SCHAFER: Meta.SEANA SMITH: OK. Go for it. On a positive note. I like it.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, it's Friday. It's Friday, the market's up. Let's talk about positive things first, right? I thought-- I don't know. Meta it really stuck out to me you could really look at these stories in similar vein in terms of ad market, right? When you think about the fact that Meta says the ad market is doing well, Snapchat is still saying the ad market isn't doing well. Well, maybe one company is just better at providing ads to people on their social media, right?But I thought it was interesting too when you think about Meta and what happened with this quarter, to see this stock rally again on earnings and really not because of the metaverse was one thing that really stuck out to me. We're still not talking about the metaverse.SEANA SMITH: Although Zuckerberg in the earnings he talked--JOSH SCHAFER: Oh, he talked about it.SEANA SMITH: --he says he's very, very committed. But yes, you're right.JOSH SCHAFER: Because people are asking about how much they're spending on it, and that's still a long-term concern. But now they're talking about AI, right? AI is what is driving this. I brought with us one quote a call that says it all, Seana. I'll read this from Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg.He said that, ""Investments that we've made over the years in AI, including the billions of dollars we've spent on AI infrastructure are clearly paying off across our ranking and recommendation systems and improving engagement and monetization."" He specifically said later in the call he thinks AI is contributing to about 7% more time spent on these apps. Of course, then you can make more money with ads, right? So AI actually helping a company make money.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly. And that is what investors wanted to hear was questions about how long we would have to wait in order for these companies to start showing how AI is boosting their bottom lines. And to that point, CFO Susan Lee also telling analysts on the earnings call that AI helped advertisers better measure the performance of their ads.And like Zuckerberg was saying they had users spending more time on the platform, advertisers were spending more money on the platform given the fact that they had a better gauge of their performance of their ads. So certainly, AI contributing to Meta's very impressive quarter. When you take a look at that ad revenue of $31.5 billion, that beat the Street's expectations.Now let's compare it to what we heard from Snap because a totally different story there. Weakness in their advertising business. We know they're investing a lot in their AI tools and what they see as the future, which certainly did pressure profitability at least in this quarter.But I think just when you take a step back, the story hasn't really changed. Snap continues to struggle against the larger players within this space. They're going up against Meta. They're going up against Google Alphabet. And they have shown at least over the last several quarters that they're lagging pretty far behind, and they're struggling to even just remotely stay in the race.JOSH SCHAFER: I mean, we're showing it on the screen right now we just were with the earnings. If you're not a profitable company and your revenue is shrinking, your stock is going to react like this when you announce earnings, right? They just need to find a way to reinvigorate revenue growth, and right now they don't have that answer, and that's clearly what's weighing on shares. It's the second straight quarter that they've seen a revenue decline.They don't really have another product outside of snap itself. Maybe the AI chatbot helps it and brings in new customers, but you're sort of just wondering how they build more monetization here, and that path just doesn't look clear right now.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, it doesn't look clear. A bit of good news though, because we don't want to rain all over everyone's parade. There's some things to get excited about when it comes to Snap. More time spent on its spotlight videos. They did have stable daily active user growth. It could signal maybe a recovery ahead. Certainly, some trends that you would want to see in terms of potential future growth, but we'll see what happens there.JOSH SCHAFER: You're more positive than me.SEANA SMITH: I'm more positive. I'm trying to find the silver lining here. All right, let's talk about some of the reads on the consumer that we got this week. Josh, we heard from Royal Caribbean. We heard from Southwest. And like it was with Meta and Snap, two very different stories here.Let's start on the upbeat note when it comes to Royal Caribbean because this was just a blockbuster quarter here for the company. The shares-- as a result, the shares hitting the highest level that we've seen since prepandemic. CEO Jason Liberty coming out saying that the demand right now is just exceptional, and there's no sign of it slowing down anytime soon.JOSH SCHAFER: This is one of the clearest examples, I think, that we have of the overall conversation about the consumer that people want to spend on experiences and continue to spend on services, right? It's really playing out in the cruise lines, in multiple different cruise lines earnings. You take a look at those stocks throughout this year, they're all rallying at pretty much insane levels at this point. It's been very impressive.But that's been the run. That's been the conversation. And it's really just not surprising to see it come out in the earnings. On the other side, Southwest is dealing with a little bit of something different when it comes to demand, right? They have that demand for people to travel. You probably get on a flight before you go on your cruise. But it was interesting what they highlighted about business demand.And so the quote I want to bring up there. The quote from the call that says it all, Seana, from CEO Bob Jordan. He said, ""It's clear that travel patterns postpandemic are not what they were prepandemic. Some of that is leisure, a lot of that is business. I expect business to continue to come back, but I think it's going to trail the restoration of leisure here for a while."" So when does it come back back, I think is the biggest question looming over Southwest.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, that is a huge question. We've talked to a number of analysts. Savi Syth was one of the analysts that we spoke to earlier this week just talking about the rebound that some airlines are seeing from their business travel customers. Southwest obviously lagging behind. That's pressuring the company here. And as a result, their revamping their flight schedules for next year to reflect some of those postpandemic changes that they are seeing from their customers in regards to their travel patterns here.So a huge contrast to what we've heard from so many of their competitors out there in the space. When you take a look at United, American Airlines, clearly, in a better position there than Southwest. All right, Josh, this is fun. You got to come back another time to break it all down.JOSH SCHAFER: There'll be more earnings next week.SEANA SMITH: There always are at least for now.]"

As a result, management raised the sales and earnings view for fiscal 2024.Quarterly results were backed by strength in the HOKA ONE ONE brand, as well as solid gains from the direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels. Growth in brands, strong balance sheet and a stable operating model poise Deckers well for success. Over the long term, management is focused on key drivers, which include building HOKA to a $1-billion plus brand, growing the UGG brand, driving DTC business via consumer acquisition and retention, and scaling international markets to boost growth.Shares of this Goleta, CA-based company have risen 10.6% in the past three months against the industry’s 11.9% decline.Let’s Delve DeeperDeckers delivered quarterly earnings of $2.41 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of $2.22 per share.

The UGG DTC business also witnessed growth, backed by more than 20% increase internationally.Gross margins for the quarter were 51.3%, up 330 basis points from last year's 48%. This was buoyed by lower freight costs, a higher mix of the HOKA brand’s revenues and an increased mix of DTC business, slightly offset by adverse foreign currency exchange rates and select closeouts of the seasonal inventory.SG&amp;A expenses climbed 15.6% year over year to $275.7 million. This was driven by reinvestment in major areas of the business, including strategic marketing, supply-chain footprint, enhanced e-commerce capabilities and talent across the organization.The company’s operating income came in at $70.7 million, up 25.6% from the year-ago quarter.

187,db45bea5-f3b9-37ac-bf79-d19ce6da6b8b,V,2023-07-29,Visa (NYSE:V) shareholders have earned a 12% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-nyse-v-shareholders-earned-110028294.html,1690628428,STORY,['V'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) shareholders have enjoyed a 69% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 54% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 12% , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Visa In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Visa achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 14% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 11% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Visa has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Visa will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Visa the TSR over the last 5 years was 74%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveVisa shareholders have received returns of 12% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the general market return. That gain looks pretty satisfying, and it is even better than the five-year TSR of 12% per year. Even if the share price growth slows down from here, there's a good chance that this is business worth watching in the long term. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Visa better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Visa .If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip our primer on the stock market and the economy, then head on over to What Are The Best Stocks To Buy Right Now? Top 5 Stocks. When it comes to the turmoil in the U.S. economy that kicked off with the coronavirus pandemic and was extended due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, July 2023 has been the climaxing month. The start of the month saw investors wait with bated breaths about a crucial jobs report that would have provided the first signal about the Federal Reserve's plans for future interest rate hikes. While the central bank had nearly penciled in a 25 basis point interest rate increase for July, the concern surrounded future decisions, especially for the next meeting in September. The month started off with rather shocking private payrolls report that nearly took the wind out of the rally in the first half of 2023, as the data showed that more than twice the number of jobs were added than analysts were actually expecting.This shock was followed by new jobs data from the Labor Department that actually undershot expectations and provided a breather to analysts and investors. Then, inflation for June also saw a cooling off and led to the annual figure sitting at 3% and ending up being below the Dow Jones consensus estimates of 3.1%. However, more drama was in store for investors as July's final week settled in. This was in the form of two additional data sets that enabled an understanding of how far the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have made it into the economy and whether there is any justification for the Fed to even consider raising rates in September or later.The first data set was the GDP growth report from the Commerce Department. This report, like several others before it, provided a conflicting set of conclusions. On a positive note, it showed that the American economy grew by 2.4% in the second quarter with the growth accelerating from 2% in the first quarter. It added that price indexes also grew at a slower pace, lending credence to the belief that no further hikes might be required since inflation is cooling. The second quarter GDP growth data was met by another data release again from the Commerce Department. This was the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index which is also the Fed's favorite inflation tool. Prior to the release, economists were expecting the core PCE to sit at 4.2% annually and 0.3% over the month, and the data met these estimates. The pure PCE, namely prices that also include food and energy, stood at 3% in June, for the slowest pace in two years, and provided a lot of respite to jittery currency markets in particular as all major currencies gained against the U.S. dollar.Story continuesWhile the pure PCE is the Fed's favorite inflation metric, the central bank also monitors the labor and jobs market through several reports. One of these is the Employment Cost Index from the Labor Department. It revealed that civilian compensation costs in America rose by just 1% in Q2 2023 - for the slowest pace of increase since the second quarter of 2021. Annually, in June 2023, wages grew by 4.6% in June, slowing down from 5% in the first quarter. Combined, this data set shows that wage pressures are slowing down, and opens up hope for this trend to continue in the future to bring down inflation and not tip the economy into a recession.So, what's going on in the stock market now that the clouds finally might be disappearing? Well, the market, as you might know, has been on a tear this year. The NASDAQ 100 index closed Friday after gaining 1.85%, while the NASDAQ Composite, the S&amp;P500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) were up 1.90%, 0.99%, and 0.50%, respectively. This brings the year to date gains of the NASDAQ 100 to an exact 45% - and at a time when many had predicted that American economic output might be on the decline. As to whether this market optimism is warranted, Brent Schutte, the chief investment officer of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management believes that those that have made money on the market are done by now and the recent euphoria comes from folks who missed out on the fireworks during H1 2023.He simply put his sentiment as:Those same people who are probably piling in right now were wrong about their outlook nine months ago and now they’re reversing course. I’m pushing in the opposite direction. The equity market will have some difficult months ahead.So, in a market where most people are confused about what's really going on for months, the true question is which stocks should one buy.

If you want to skip our introduction to the investor, his background, and how some investments have performed over the year, then head on over to Billionaire Jeff Vinik's Top 5 Stocks.Jeff Vinik has a short history in the hedge fund industry. He set up his fund first in the 90s and then shut it down later after making remarkable returns. Then, he tried setting up his fund again but shut it down in less than a year after citing difficulties in raising capital. A graduate of Harvard University, he is known primarily for running one of the biggest mutual funds in the U.S. and then starting his own hedge fund called Vinik Asset Management.Both of these earned him his fair share of fame in the finance industry. Under Mr. Vinik's management, the Fidelity Magellan Fund earned quite a bit of controversy as he was criticized for moving the fund's money away from attractive technology stocks into bonds. This was the time when semiconductor stocks (which are all the buzz these days) were in their early phases of their stock market presence. This was also the time when investing in mutual funds - especially by folks who were using their personal savings  - was peaking, as 3 million Americans had piled $3 trillion into the industry.At Magellan, Mr. Vinik created quite a bit of controversy when it came to light that he had sold large portions of the fund's holdings in semiconductor stocks at a time when the shares were peaking. The semiconductor sector is well known for its cycles of ups and downs, with the latest one undergoing right now as chip makers wait while chip designers' product inventory is digested in the retail chain. Back in the early 1990s, Taiwan and South Korea were rising in stature in the chip world (these two now have some of the most important chip companies in the world). The start of the decade was marked by a strong performance from the Asian firms, but America, which was still a global chip manufacturing base back then, was struggling from an economic contraction in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, high inflation, and high interest rates (the economy is also experiencing somewhat similar conditions over the past year or so).Story continuesThis crunch created the perfect conditions for a boom in 1995 and the subsequent slowdown which was also reflected in the stock market. Just as all this was happening, Mr. Vinik had written to investors of the Magellan Fund that chip firms, such as Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) were solid investments. This was in a letter that was mailed in November as part of the fund's semiannual report. However, controversy surfaced when the Washington Post reported that Mr. Vinik had actually started selling Micron shares in October and before investors received the letter. This selloff was part of a broader exit from the technology sector with other stocks also being sold. Less than a year after his decision, he would quit Magellan and set up his own hedge fund, with some speculating that the increased scrutiny from 1995 contributed to him leaving Fidelity.Vinik Asset Management would go on to make a big impact in the hedge fund industry right off the bat. In the first year, the hedge fund's return would sit at a whopping 93.8% and then go on to an average of 48% for five years. After this burst of performance, Mr. Vinik would return $4.2 billion to investors and close the fund to outside investment in 2000. He would, however, try to open up his hedge fund twice again, first in 2005 and then in 2019. The first run would be quite successful as Vinik Asset Management would go on to operate for nearly eight years before a downturn in gold stocks and other factors would make it return capital. The second run was short lived, with Mr. Vinik explaining that it had become difficult to raise capital.So, today we'll take a look at how his long term investments would have performed ten years after Vinik Asset's final serious foray into the stock market. Some firms that would have performed well are eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR).Billionaire Jeff Vinik's Stock Picks and 10-Year PerformanceOur Methodology To compile our list of Jeff Vinik's long term stock performance, we first listed his fund's top twenty investments during the first quarter of 2013, which is the latest data available.

Price and EPS SurpriseMarriott International, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMarriott International, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Marriott International, Inc. QuoteFor revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $6.05 billion, suggesting growth of 13.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Let's check out the factors that are likely to have influenced the quarter.Key Factors to NoteRevenuesMarriott’s second-quarter revenues are expected to have increased on a year-over-year basis, courtesy of robust leisure demand, strong global booking trends and easing of travel restrictions throughout Asia Pacific (particularly in Greater China). These factors are likely to have enabled the growth of revenue per available room (RevPAR), especially on a global basis. This reflects the boost in occupancy rates and average daily rate on a year-over-year basis. With global trends improving, the recovery momentum is likely to have continued in the quarter under review.Owing to an increase in RevPAR and higher co-branded credit card fees for the second quarter, Marriott anticipates gross fee revenues to be in the range of $1,205-$1,225 million, up from the previous quarter’s reported value of $1,073 million.For the quarter, our model predicts gross fee revenues to be $1,224.5 million, up 14.1% year over year. We also anticipate owned, leased, and other revenues to increase 16.7% to $424.9 million year over year.The company expects to witness strong year-over-year growth in the international markets, primarily in Asia Pacific, in the second quarter. The travel demand and booking trend recovery momentum in China have majorly added to the anticipation.Geographically, for the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects RevPAR year-over-year growth in worldwide, international, and U.S. &amp; Canada markets to be within the respective ranges of 10-12%, 27-29% and 5-7%.We expect RevPAR in worldwide, international, and U.S. &amp; Canada markets to grow 10.2% to $131.56, 29% to $117.29 and 5% to $138.16, respectively, year over year. We also expect Asia Pacific RevPAR to grow 32.7% to $104.84 year over year.For the second quarter, our model also predicts total number of rooms to increase 3.8% to 1,558,254 units on a year-over-year basis.MarginsAlthough persisting inflation and economic challenges are potential headwinds, Marriott is still likely to witness margin and earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. The improvement in global trends and RevPAR growth are likely to have helped the company to survive the tough economic conditions.For the second quarter, Marriott expects general, administrative, and other expenses to range within $250-$245 million, up from $216 million reported in the prior-year quarter.  Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range within $1,140-$1,165 million, up from $1,019 million in the year-ago quarter.For the quarter, we expect the company’s general, administrative, and other expenses to increase 6.5% to $246 million year over year. Also, adjusted EBITDA is expected to rise 12.8% to $1,149 million year over year.Furthermore, we also expect adjusted EBITDA and operating margins to increase 20 basis points (bps) to 19.3% and 50 bps to 16.6%, respectively, year over year.Story continuesWhat Our Model IndicatesOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Marriott for the quarter to be reported.

Adjusted earnings per share of $1.86 was better than the estimate of $1.72, but revenue of $19.2 billion was just shy of estimates. The telecom company also raised its full-year guidance slightly. In an interview with Yahoo Finance Live, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert cites three reasons for the quarterly results, saying ""customers are coming to us more, they're staying with us more, and they're buying up our rate card voluntarily."" Sievert recently saw his contract extended by 5 years, putting him in charge into 2028. When asked what T-Mobile will look like in 2028, Sievert says the world is ""going to see a company in 2028 that is the market leader"" and ""that is the best in the world at connecting customers to their world.""Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Well, T-Mobile shares edging higher after the company reported mixed results after the close last night. Profit coming in above analysts' expectations, but revenue did fall a bit short of the Street's estimates. Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi sat down with T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert and asked him first about his takeaways from the quarter.MIKE SIEVERT: You know, It's really simple. I mean, customers are coming to us more. They're staying with us more. And they're buying up our rate card voluntarily. I mean, on the coming to us more, do you know, this quarter Q2 was the biggest quarter-- for Q2, in eight years at T-Mobile in terms of postpaid phone net add growth. And we did it in part because of the second thing, they're staying with us. This was the best churning quarter in T-Mobile history, with the lowest churn in the industry for the first time.Then the third thing, they're buying up the rate card. In fact, for the first time ever, we introduced Go5G Plus, and it instantly became our most popular plan. And it happens to be our most premium plan.BRIAN SOZZI: Is this just a factor of or is the function of T-Mobile being the low price leader in this industry and that's why you're not seeing what we're seeing on some of your competitors where people are still having problems paying their bill?Story continuesMIKE SIEVERT: Well, it's interesting I mean, when you have a network performance like ours, which is twice as fast as the next nearest competitor and reaches twice as much land mass, with the fastest version of our 5G, people want more of it. And so they're voluntarily self selecting up our rate card. And as I said, our most premium offer is also our most popular offer, with 60% attach among new customers in Q2.BRIAN SOZZI: I think every quarter we have talked maybe going over two years, whatever it is, Mike, you've been consistent in raising your guidance. Why does this continue to happen and how many more guidance lifts do you think you have in the belt?MIKE SIEVERT: Well, over 2 and 1/2 years ago at our analyst day, we laid out a strategy for this company that showcased that not only would we build the best network, we would have the resources to defend the best value, and we were going to go after massive under-penetrated segments where there's lots of opportunity for T-Mobile. And this is a differentiated strategy.And what we have been delivering ever since then is remarkably consistent execution against that strategy. And that's why we can set goals beat them and then raise them.BRIAN SOZZI: Talk to us about how you generate cash. You continue to throw off a good amount of free cash. Why are you seemingly creating more of this than a lot of your peers and how do you plan to spend it?MIKE SIEVERT: Well, T-Mobile's cash flows year-to-date are cash development per revenue dollar. Think of it as cash flow margin, so the highest in the industry. And that's despite having the lowest prices and the fastest growth, things that you would think would suppress cash.And so it's really remarkable, and it shows the resilience of our strategy. It shows that we've been able to take our superior spectrum resources and deliver the best network. That with our superior balance sheet, we're able to defend the best value. And we've been out executing.And so because of that, not only are we outgrowing everyone on service revenue top line, but we're translating that into double-digit EBITDA growth, best in the industry, and the highest cash flows per revenue dollar year-to-date in the industry.BRIAN SOZZI: Stock's off about off its 52-week highs from seven or eight months ago. Do you plan to get more aggressive with buybacks this quarter?MIKE SIEVERT: Well, the board authorized an initial $14 billion program as part of an aspiration we communicated for up to $60 billion over three years. And so we're well on our way.The authorization that we have right now expires in September. And so we will continue executing against that. And then as a board, we will deliberate about when and how big and when to start the next one. But the thesis that underlies it, which is the massive cash flow expansion of this business, is fully intact.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, I have to-- I have to follow up, Mike. I mean, do you think you can announce something bigger than what you have been executing on?MIKE SIEVERT: Well, again, we executed 14 billion. We're almost done with that program, on our way to an aspiration we talked about, a three-year program of $60 billion. So mathematically it shows that most of the opportunity is still in front of us.BRIAN SOZZI: And you know, this-- by the way, this cash flow, it doesn't just stop in '25. I mean, this model has been consistent, resilient, reliable. That means you've got '26, '27, '28 to look forward to as well, as cash flows continue to evolve on this business.I really enjoyed the team's breakdown on the earnings call, Mike, about why your margins may be below some of your competitors. Do you think you can close the gap with them?MIKE SIEVERT: Well, we have geographical differences. For example, a lot of our backhaul costs flow through OpEx. Whereas for them, it's CapEx. And we have an offsetting CapEx efficiency.Our CapEx of 9 to $10 billion a year in our current year, as well as our ongoing guidance, is the best in the industry. That's why you have to look at it on a cash basis. And you have to remember that we're outgrowing everybody and defending the lowest prices in the industry. And yet still, delivering better cash production per service revenue dollar.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, speaking of defending, the pass month is-- your competitors have been out there defending what they may or may not have in terms of lead cables in the ground. And that issue reported by the Wall Street Journal has really dented both of those stocks, not yours though. Do you have any lead cables? Have you identified any problems with inside of your business you're going to have to address?MIKE SIEVERT: Well, I am not and don't plan to become an expert on lead leaching. And so we-- we're a pure-play wireless company, so this isn't our issue.But I saw all that unfold, and I know our friends are dealing with a lot. Some of it may be real, some of it may not. I just don't know.BRIAN SOZZI: Fair enough. So take us through, you recently signed a five-year extension to your contract. That takes you what, to 2028? What's your-- what's your vision? What does this company look like by 2028?MIKE SIEVERT: Well, first of all, I'm having a ball. You know, I've been here 11 years, I've been CEO for 3 and 1/2 years. And part of why I do this is we have an incredible team. And for us to build something lasting and special in this country, which is a superior way for people to connect, that's so exciting. Our mission is to be the best in the world at connecting customers to their world. And we're on our way. So that's kind of what motivates me.I think you're going to see a company in 2028 that is the market leader, that is the best in the world at connecting customers to their world, that has reshaped itself around technology and AI and machine learning.Our vision to become a deeply data-informed, AI-enabled, digital-first company is something that will make its way more and more into the fore in the coming years. There's so much change to accomplish. So I'm having fun.BRIAN SOZZI: What's T-Mobile's role in AI?MIKE SIEVERT: Well, we employ AI all across our business. I mean, unlike in a lot of people that sort of suddenly discovered it because they heard of ChatGPT last year, we're a technology company. So we've been AI as has been around a long time.And we deploy it deeply with our partners in terms of algorithms on how our network prioritizes connections and assigns spectrum bands to each customer. We apply it in our marketing algorithms because we're a pretty sophisticated marketer.We apply it increasingly, and we'll do even more in terms of how we handle and route customer care calls and digitalize and give people self-care opportunities, and how we prioritize capital and projects for our network and many other places in our business. And of course, large language models, which are the kind of new flavor of AI, just open up even more opportunities.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I'm going to have to go back to college, Mike. But before we let you go, since we last spoke, Apple came out with a new headset. It is very expensive. I don't know if I'm getting one.But nonetheless, a lot of people are likely to go out and buy these things. Do you see an opportunity for your business there? I imagine a device like that needs to be connected at very high levels.MIKE SIEVERT: Well, you know, I'm very excited about anytime there's a new and great things happening in the marketplace. And so that's a big moment.I remember when the first PDAs came out. Remember the Newton years ago? Nobody could afford that. And so people said, well, will handheld devices ever be a thing? Look at the world we live in today. And so obviously, these are exciting developments.And to your question, what big innovative devices and software solutions need is an ultra-high capacity network because our lives are connected. And that's what we do. We've built the highest capacity network in US history. We're way in front of our competitors. And we intend to defend that lead for years to come.BRIAN SOZZI: And just so the younger folks out there realize, PDA is personal digital assistant. Did I get that right, Mike? Did I get it?MIKE SIEVERT: Yeah. You remember the Newton? It was too expensive for anybody to buy. But people said, therefore nobody would ever have a handheld device. I mean, that's not the world we live in.BRIAN SOZZI: [INAUDIBLE] I come from the foldable phone era, which look, we're seeing foldable phones come on now, Mike. I mean, do you see these as a big opportunity? Is this a flash in the pan? I mean, are we going back in time here?MIKE SIEVERT: Of course, no. Listen, that's exciting, and Samsung's been a real innovator in this area. What we do is we just let the consumer be the guide. And some people have really been attracted to those things. Other people like the big flat screens. And look, our job is to make sure we partner with all the best, and importantly, connect all those devices to the highest capacity network that's ever been built.- Thanks to T-Mobile CEO, Mike Sievert, and of course, our very own, Brian Sozzi.]"

Goldman Sachs Telecom Analyst Brett Feldman details how replacing the lead cables could ""elongate the time frame from transforming from an operator of older, slower networks to an operator of advanced high-speed networks."" Feldman highlights the competition between service providers to transition into wireless, while also commenting on T-Mobile's position in the telecom sector.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- The Department of Justice, an Environmental Protection Agency are investigating telecom giants Verizon and AT&amp;T for the potential health and environmental risks from a network of toxic lead sheathed cables running across the US. Now, this comes after a ""Wall Street Journal"" investigation revealed that AT&amp;T and Verizon and other telecom companies left more than 2,000 toxic lead cables on poles, under waterways, and in soil across the US.Reporters tested near the cables showing that dozens of spots registered lead levels exceeding EPA safety guidelines. Joining us now is Brett Feldman-- Goldman Sachs Telecom Analyst. Good to see you, Brett. So talk about how this is affecting the price targets that you have for the telecom companies that you're following.BRETT FELDMAN: Yeah. Well, thanks for having me on. This was a surprising issue to investors. It's not something that had been talked about by the companies, it's not something we had heard regulators talk about prior to this series by the ""Wall Street Journal."" And candidly, investors really don't know what to do with this information. It's very unclear the extent to which this really is a new risk factor for these companies.But just to put in context how concerned investors are, AT&amp;T and Verizon are trading at some of the lowest valuations we've ever seen. An easy way of looking at that is simply looking at their dividend yields, which are offering you generally over 7 and 1/2% right now. The only times we have ever seen valuations that low for these stocks in the last 20 years is during periods of genuine global crises.Story continuesSo the Global Financial Crisis and the onset of COVID lockdowns. It has affected the way we think about these stocks, not because we specifically know how to factor this into our forecasts, if we even need to, but it's pretty clear and it's going to take the market a little bit of time to digest this and to think about what this might mean going forward. And for that reason, it's our view that you will probably continue to see these stocks trade at historically or near historically low valuations at least over the near term.JULIE HYMAN: Brett, it's Julie here. What's interesting as well is that the companies themselves, they've talked about this but they do seem to have downplayed it to some extent or what little information they've given us has sort of said that their exposure is not huge. Do you think that they have done a good job addressing what was in those ""Wall Street Journal"" stories?BRETT FELDMAN: I think the narrative is still unfolding. You know, initially, we didn't have a lot of information to work with. This wasn't a category of information that we, typically, got disclosure on. Over the last two weeks, AT&amp;T and Verizon have given us a high-level view to help us just think about the presence of lead sheathed cables in their network.I think the point they're trying to make is that because those cables are so old, they intrinsically make up a very small portion of their networks. And so we're starting to get a little bit of insight. But you go back to a point I made earlier, which is that the market still doesn't really know what to do with this based on what we do know about the size of their traditional landline networks, in terms of how many locations are in their regions, based on some of this new disclosure they've given about the length of the cabling.You can see that AT&amp;T probably has more exposure, yet Verizon has lost more market value. That doesn't really make a ton of sense. And I think it just shows we haven't gotten to a point where the investment community really thinks that they have a framework for understanding how to digest all of this.- I mean, and they acknowledged AT&amp;T did it as well in these most recent earnings and during the call as well, that the industry began phasing out these replacements or the placement of these lead clad telecom cables in 1950s. But they continue to be used in the power grid.And so all of that considered, is the unknown from the investor perspective, how much it's going to cost them to go out where mandated to go and retrieve these cables, reel them in, whatever that kind of strategy or operation even looks like, or on the other side of that, if they could see severe fines.BRETT FELDMAN: You know, we have no idea how to figure out whether there could be fines or whether there could be legal action. It's just too early. And we don't have a framework for that. What we do is we look at it as fundamental analysts. And the point that we made is, if you look at AT&amp;T, for example, there are about 57 million households that are in their traditional region.But they're only able to offer a fiber to the home, internet connection to about 20 million of them today. They have a huge project underway to try to convert more of those homes away from these old telecom cables, some of which might have led, to really advanced fiber cables.If going forward, they're going to have to spend more time with that process, maybe because the local public utility commissions asked for environmental surveys or because they have to remove cabling that historically may have left in place, it could elongate the time frame from transforming from being an operator of older, slower networks to an operator of advanced, high speed networks. And that's a really big deal.If you look at network operators with advanced networks, their profit margins are about twice the level. We see at companies like AT&amp;T in their old region. So any friction associated with this transition really does degrade their ability to amplify the shareholder returns that they can achieve. And that's putting aside whether they might face some sort of external legal or regulatory issue.JULIE HYMAN: Well, and that's kind of what I wanted to get at as well. I mean, these are businesses that absent the lead issue, that they're slowing, right? I mean, listen. Telecom was never a huge growth business, right? It was more viewed as a way for investors to get dividends, for example. Do investors, though, need to change the way they look at these companies in an environment when, for example, so many people are cutting the cord, there's a lot of discounting going on in the mobile side of the business. How should people be thinking about them?BRETT FELDMAN: Well, you raise a good point. Before these headlines hit, telecom stocks hadn't traded particularly well anyhow. And that's for the exact reason you just mentioned, which is that we've seen some deceleration in growth. During the onset of COVID lockdowns, telecom providers, cable operators, they all saw huge lifts in demand for their services, particularly, their premium tiers of services.The highest-tiered mobile plans were very popular, the highest-tiered broadband plans were very profitable. And we've come off those highs, and the market has been bracing for deceleration in these categories. All of these major providers reported results this week. And the biggest surprise were that numbers are actually a little better than we expected.We are seeing slowing, we're not seeing quite as much slowing as we would have expected. But what investors continue to see and what worries the market a bit is how much competition has emerged between the wireless carriers and the cable companies. So just as an example, the two biggest wireless carriers in the US, which are Verizon and T-Mobile, added more home internet customers, that's home broadband connections in this last quarter than the cable companies did.But the biggest cable companies, which are Comcast and Charter, added significantly more new wireless customers than we saw at the major wireless carriers. And so there's this increasing degree of competition against the backdrop of slowing growth that has the market a little bit concerned.JULIE HYMAN: And then finally, just quickly here, I wanted to ask about your top pick in this business, which is T-Mobile, which you just mentioned. It's up this year but not by a lot. But it has pretty consistently been outperforming the legacy providers. How is it going to continue to do so?BRETT FELDMAN: Yeah. A great point there. T-Mobile is something of a unique story in this sector. So while the sector hasn't seen a lot of growth, T-Mobile has. And it's really because they just continue to take advantage of their acquisition of sprint, which closed over three years ago. It's allowed them to gain share in parts of the market that historically haven't participated in, including rural communities and the business market.And as a result, they're still leading in subscriber growth. They haven't captured all the cost synergies in their reported financials yet. And so they're leading in profitability growth. And most exciting, I think, for this company, is it's the most compelling capital return story. They are in the process of a very significant share repurchase program. We expect that they will repurchase $60 billion of stock over the course of this year, next year, and 2025. That's over one third of their total market value.And during that period of time, we expect that the cash flow that they generate per share will compound annually north of 20%. There's nothing else in the category like that. And I think as investors continually see visibility into that unfolding, the stock will continue to outperform. It really should begin to outperform more than it has so far.- We appreciate that breakdown. Brett Feldman-- Goldman Sachs Telecom Analyst, thank you so much.BRETT FELDMAN: Take care.]"

First, Intel benefited significantly like many other semiconductor companies during the pandemic because of the PC boom. And then that boom turned into a bust over the last few quarters. So we are coming off of the troughs. We are coming off of the lows and things are stabilizing. From a demand standpoint, the PC market is starting to stabilize. And for Intel, they have been under shipping the end market because of the excess inventory, you know, buffer inventory of components built by customers during the pandemic. So that inventory is being worked down, so things are normalizing and looking up for Intel.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So Srini, when you look at the recovery for PCs and data centers, what sort of numbers would you need to see to really see a convincing rebound or essentially a new normal post-pandemic.SRINI PAJJURI: Yeah. So just to kind of give you some numbers. During the pandemic, we were looking at close to 350 million units of PC shipments per year. That has come down to about 250 to 260 million units. And our expectation is that this is not a growth market. You know, I think Intel management believes that this is a growth market, maybe low single digits at best.Story continuesOn the corporate side, I think there's still a relatively stable demand. Consumer is somewhat mixed and part of it is China as well. Overall, our expectation is that it's going to be a stable market. But at the same time, we do see an opportunity for Intel and other chip suppliers because of the functionality increasing potentially. We do foresee potentially some AI functionality getting into PCs, so that helps the pricing, the ASPs because you need more powerful CPUs going forward. So that's a tailwind to Intel.But again, our main, you know, bull case on Intel is not predicated upon the PC business. It's more on the data center side and also, you know, their manufacturing roadmap getting back on track.BRAD SMITH: Is your base case also include them being able to maintain profitability?SRINI PAJJURI: Of course. You know, if you look at Intel's profitability, they never lost. I mean, I think the last time they lost money was back during the, you know, financial crisis in 2009. And that was what one quarter. And that happened again in Q1 of this year. Management was forecasting another quarter of losses, but now they reported profitability this quarter.The free cash flow is still a little bit of an issue. But even that is getting better. They're spending a lot of CapEx on manufacturing. But, you know, our expectation is that even free cash flow will turn positive second half of this year, and that should also help the stock going forward. But profitability and free cash flow is very important for us.JULIE HYMAN: So, Srini, if you're focused on demand and data centers in particular, the company did say sales were down 15% year over year in that division. What's going to change there that's going to help demand?SRINI PAJJURI: Yeah. So look, I think, again, even data center is another market that benefited significantly during the pandemic because the work from home partly. And then now we are seeing a lot of investments going to AI and machine learning. AI requires specialized processors, you know, GPUs and accelerators.Intel doesn't have a strong position currently in that market. That's dominated by Nvidia. And as the spending is shifting to AI related, you know, workloads there is an impact on the CPU market where Intel is the dominant supplier.But at the same time, you know, the cyclical correction, the cyclical headwinds are fading even in data center CPUs. And our expectation is that longer term, AI will benefit not only GPUs, but also CPUs. But in the short-term, there is some impact, and that's the reason. But even with all those issues, Intel's numbers were better than expected even in data center. So I think that's the reason the stock is reacting positively today.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And, Srini, as we look at the AI story, I mean, on the earnings call, we saw from Pat Gelsinger saying that Intel plans to build AI into everything that they build. But as Sean Hollister from The Verge says, Nvidia is selling the right kind of shovel in this AI gold rush. How should we think about how Intel is positioning itself in this?SRINI PAJJURI: Yeah. So it's a very interesting market. I mean, AI is not new. AI has been around for several years. What changed since last year is the ChatGPT, what we call the large language models. This is generative AI. So most of the generative AI applications are today are run in the cloud. You have to train these massive models and you need a lot of compute. And that's only available in the cloud. You can't simply do that in edge devices like PCs or servers.So initially, we expect most of the investment to be in data centers as a result, but as applications emerge, it's possible that we'll see local processing of AI applications, especially as we deploy some smaller models. There's a lot of talk about, for example, personal assistants. Do you need to go back to the cloud every time you ask the personal assistant something, right?So if you have an application on your PC or on your smartphone, you will need more powerful processors to run those PCs and smartphones as well. So there is an opportunity there.And Intel also participates in other markets in 5G infrastructure, for example. So there's an opportunity to use AI applications. I mean our view is that AI will be in pretty much every application that we use every workload, so anywhere there is compute and, you know, Intel participates in that market. And I do see a benefit longer term, but for short-term, I think most of the spending is going to GPUs.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. Well, great having you on with your insights. Srini Pajjuri there, Raymond James Managing Director and Senior Analyst, thanks so much. Have a great weekend.SRINI PAJJURI: Thank you.]"

Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, delivering an earnings surprise of 5.8%, on average.Let’s check out the factors that have shaped BDX’s performance prior to this announcement.Factors to NoteBD Life SciencesOn second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call in May, BD confirmed that it continued to witness lower COVID-only testing revenues, which led to a decline in its Life Sciences segment. However, excluding COVID-only testing, an uptick in the Life Sciences segment’s base revenues was solid. Strong growth across both Integrated Diagnostic Solutions (IDS) and Biosciences (BDB) business units was witnessed.Strength in IDS reflected strong base business revenue growth. This was driven by growth in Microbiology, aided by the adoption of BD Kiestra IdentifA and Total Modular Track solutions, and Specimen Management and continued double-digit growth from Molecular In-Vitro Diagnostic assay leveraging the incremental BD Max installed base. BDB unit has also been recording strong Research Reagents growth and continued strong demand for its BD FACSymphony A1/A5 SE research analyzers combined with improved BD FACSLyric.These trends are likely to have continued in third-quarter fiscal 2023 as well. This, in turn, is anticipated to have contributed to the strength in base business despite the expected ceaseless fall in COVID-only testing revenues. This is likely to have significantly driven up the segmental revenues.BD has launched a few products in recent months. In June, the company announced the worldwide commercial launch of a new automated instrument, BD FACSDuet Premium Sample Preparation System.Story continuesIn May, announced the worldwide commercial launch of a new-to-world cell sorting instrument, BD FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter, featuring two breakthrough technologies (BD SpectralFX Technology and BD CellView Image Technology). These products are likely to have witnessed robust customer adoptions, thereby pushing up the segmental revenues in the fiscal third quarter.In May, BD received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for the new BD Kiestra Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus imaging application. This raises our optimism about the stock.However, the continued decline in COVID-only testing revenues is likely to have weighed on BD’s Life Sciences segment’s revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2023. Despite this, on the fiscal second-quarter earnings call, management stated that its base revenue growth and consistent execution of its margin goals are enabling BD to offset lower COVID-only testing revenues and the latest foreign exchange rates while reinvesting in the business to drive future growth. This looks promising for the stock.The Zacks Model estimates the BD Life Sciences revenues to be $1.32 billion, suggesting an improvement of 0.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and EPS SurpriseBecton, Dickinson and Company Price and EPS SurpriseBecton, Dickinson and Company price-eps-surprise | Becton, Dickinson and Company QuoteBD InterventionalThis segment continued to witness a strong worldwide performance in Advanced Repair and Reconstruction in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Continued strong market adoption of Phasix hernia resorbable scaffold and double-digit worldwide growth in Biosurgery (aided by Arista AH absorbable hemostat) resulted in the upturn. Strong procedure volumes had also contributed to the Surgery’s performance.Revenues in Peripheral Intervention were also strong. Double-digit growth in Peripheral Vascular Disease on the back of the Venovo relaunch, global penetration of Rotarex and the strong growth in Oncology in the United States and Greater Asia acted as tailwinds. Robust Urology and Critical Care revenues were driven by double-digit growth in the PureWick franchise (which addresses chronic incontinence) and Endourology.These trends are likely to have been continued in the fiscal third quarter as well, thereby significantly pushing up the segmental revenues.A notable announcement in this segment was BD’s inking a definitive agreement to sell its Surgical Instrumentation platform to STERIS. The company will provide additional details about the divestiture, expected to close within BD's fiscal year 2023, subject to customary closing conditions, in its fiscal third-quarter earnings call.The Zacks Model estimates the BD Interventional revenues to be $1.16 billion, suggesting an uptick of 1.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Other Factors to NoteBD is likely to have witnessed continued momentum in its Medical segment. Continued strong performance in Vascular Access Management and investments in high-growth end markets like Pharmacy Automation, among others, resulted in this uptrend. BD is also likely to have benefited from continued capacity investments in BD Hypak and innovation in products like BD Effivax, BD Hylok and BD Neopak.In May, BD announced expanded customer availability of an all-in-one prefilled flush syringe with an integrated disinfection unit, BD PosiFlush SafeScrub. On the fiscal second-quarter earnings call, management confirmed the launch of PowerMe midline catheter in China. These products are likely to have witnessed robust adoption in recent months, thereby driving up revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the current unstable macroeconomic business environment, resulting from the supply-chain constraints and inflationary pressures, is likely to have weighed on the company’s fiscal third-quarter revenues, raising our apprehension.The Estimate PictureFor third-quarter fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.83 billion, implying an improvement of 4.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus estimate for EPS is pegged at $2.89, indicating an increase of 8.7% from the prior-year period’s reported number.What Our Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for BD this time around.

209,7b5b8271-71b8-3d46-9da2-21278e2c8607,MCK,2023-07-29,Pick These 4 Stocks With Superb Interest Coverage Ratio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pick-4-stocks-superb-interest-150100328.html,1690556460,STORY,"['ATO', 'LECO', 'ORLY', 'MCK']","[Given the current economic scenario, investors should gauge the changing market dynamics and accordingly chalk out a sturdy investment strategy. The Federal Reserve's most recent action of increasing the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points has propelled it to its highest level in 22 years. This decision, though aimed to check inflation, has stirred concerns among investors. As the benchmark interest rate climbs to a range of 5.25%-5.5%, investors may face challenges in balancing risk and return.Well, you can simply arrive at a decision to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns when the market is facing myriad issues. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision.Well, a company should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio called the interest coverage ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. LECO, McKesson Corporation MCK, Atmos Energy Corporation ATO and O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. ORLY are four stocks with an impressive interest coverage ratio.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company. The company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.The interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Story continuesWhat’s the Strategy?Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest coverage ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Lincoln Electric Holdings, a leader in the engineering, design, and manufacturing of advanced arc welding solutions, automated joining, assembly and cutting systems, plasma and oxy-fuel cutting equipment, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of B.

(AP) — A judge in Florida on Friday refused to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Gov. Ron DeSantis appointees against Disney’s efforts to neutralize the governor's takeover of Disney World’s governing district.The judge in state court in Orlando denied Disney's motion in the lawsuit that says the company wrongly stripped appointees of powers over design and construction at Disney World when it made agreements with predecessors, who were supporters.The case is one of two lawsuits stemming from the takeover, which was retaliation for the company’s public opposition to the so-called Don’t Say Gay legislation championed by DeSantis and Republican lawmakers. In the other lawsuit, in federal court in Tallahassee, Disney says DeSantis violated the company’s free speech rights.The governor has touted his yearlong feud with Disney in his run for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, often accusing the entertainment giant of being too “woke.” Disney has accused the governor of violating its First Amendment rights.Attorneys for Disney had argued that any decision in state court would be moot since the Republican-controlled Legislature already has passed a law voiding agreements that the company made with a prior governing board made up of Disney supporters that gave design and construction powers to the company.The entertainment giant had asked that the state court case be put on hold if it's not dismissed until the federal lawsuit in Tallahassee was resolved since they covered the same ground and that lawsuit was filed first.In that case, Disney sued DeSantis and his appointees to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District in an effort to stop the takeover, saying the governor was violating the company’s free speech and “weaponizing the power of government to punish private business.”DeSantis wasn’t a party in the state court lawsuit.The fight between DeSantis and Disney began last year after the company, facing significant pressure internally and externally, publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades, a policy critics call “Don’t Say Gay.”Story continuesAs punishment, DeSantis took over the district through legislation passed by Florida lawmakers and appointed a new board of supervisors to oversee municipal services for the sprawling theme parks and hotels. But before the new board came in, the company made agreements with previous oversight board members who were Disney supporters that stripped the new supervisors of their authority over design and construction.In response, DeSantis and Florida lawmakers passed the legislation that repealed those agreements.Disney announced in May that it was scrapping plans to build a new campus in central Florida and relocate 2,000 employees from Southern California to work in digital technology, finance and product development. Disney had planned to build the campus about 20 miles (30 kilometers) from the giant Walt Disney World theme park resort.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

If those deals were voided, the district has said it would nearly wipe out Disney's federal case against DeSantis.A Disney spokesperson said the decision ""has no bearing"" on the federal lawsuit seeking to ""vindicate Disney's constitutional rights.""""We are fully confident Disney will prevail in both the federal and state cases,"" the spokesperson said in an email.A spokesperson for the oversight district declined to comment.The skirmish began last year after Disney criticized a Florida law banning classroom discussion of sexuality and gender identity with younger children. DeSantis, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, has repeatedly attacked ""woke Disney"" in public remarks.DeSantis rallied lawmakers to pass bills that reconstituted the district as the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District and transferred power over the board to the governor from Disney. Lawmakers also retroactively invalidated agreements that Disney reached with the prior board of what was then the Reedy Creek Improvement District on the eve of it being brought under DeSantis's control.Disney filed its lawsuit in April against the governor in federal court, claiming DeSantis ""weaponized"" state government against the company for attacking the classroom gender discussion law.Disney asked the federal court to prevent the state from enforcing the laws directed at the company and to reinstate the development agreements favorable to Disney that were struck with the prior district's board.

Both the bottom line and top line beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Quarter DetailsThe company reported GAAP earnings of $1,481 million or 35 cents per share against a net loss of $454 million or a loss of 11 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The significant improvement was due to a better-than-expected performance across most operating segments, leading to solid revenues for the quarter. The bottom line also gained from lower operating expenses and income tax benefit.Non-GAAP earnings in the reported quarter were $547 million or 13 cents per share compared with $1,148 million or 28 cents per share a year ago. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17 cents.Intel Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseIntel Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseIntel Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Intel Corporation QuoteGAAP revenues in the reported quarter were $12,949 million, down 15.5% year over year. Despite the year-over-year decline, quarterly revenues were more than $900 million above the mid-point of the guided range. The top line beat the consensus estimate of $12,025 million. In response to supply chain issues, the company is closely collaborating with customers and suppliers to effectively address their most critical needs. Intel envisions a sustained recovery in the second half of the year with normalization in inventory levels and improvement in long-term PC outlook driven by higher usage compared to pre-pandemic levels.Segment PerformanceBy segments, Client Computing Group (CCG, 52.4% of total revenues) revenues were down 11.7% year over year to $6,780 million. This was largely due to global TAM (total addressable market) contraction and inventory reduction by OEMs. However, it exceeded management expectations and was well above our estimates of $5,799 million. The company expects shipments to align more closely to consumption patterns in the second half as the pace of customer inventory burn slowed.Datacenter and AI Group (DCAI, 30.9%) revenues fell 14.7% year over year to $4,004 million. This was due to OEM inventory reductions and competitive pressures. However, it exceeded our estimates of $3,779.1 million. Intel witnessed TAM contraction across all CPU market segments. The company has a singular focus on regaining performance and TCO leadership across all workloads and use cases from enterprise to cloud, as the business is expected to return to normal demand levels.Network and Edge Group (NEX, 10.5%) revenues declined 38.3% to $1,364 million as elevated inventory levels and soft demand trends with sluggish recovery in China affected segment sales. Various firms have also delayed infrastructure investments owing to macroeconomic uncertainty. The segment revenues fell short of our estimates of $1,516.4 million.Mobileye (3.5%) revenues were relatively flat at $454 million, primarily driven by higher demand for EyeQ products. Intel Foundry Services (IFS, 1.8%) revenues were $232 million, up 307% on increased packaging revenues and higher sales of IMS Nanofabrication tools, while All Other (0.9%) revenues were $115 million, falling 47.7% year over year.Story continuesOther Operating DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin was 39.8%, down from 44.8% in the year-earlier quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin contracted from 9.3% to 3.5%.CCG's operating income was up 18.6% year over year to $1,039 million, while DCAI's operating loss more than doubled to $161 million, primarily due to higher unit costs. NEX's operating loss was $187 million against an operating income of $294 million on lower revenues, while that from Mobileye declined to $129 million from $190 million a year ago on higher investments.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityAs of Jun 30, 2023, Intel had cash and cash equivalents of $8,349 million, with $46,335 million of long-term debt. During the first six months of 2023, Intel generated $1,023 million of cash from operating activities compared with $6,700 million in the year-ago period.OutlookFor the third quarter of 2023, Intel expects non-GAAP revenues to be $12.9-$13.9 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin is likely to be 43%. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be around 20 cents per share. The company anticipates customer inventory levels and business uncertainties to stabilize gradually. Intel expects the macroeconomic headwinds to ease steadily in the second half of the year.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderIntel currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Here are some other top-ranked stocks from the broader industry.InterDigital, Inc.

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President, M&amp;A, John Faucher.John FaucherThank you, Allison. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the Q2 2023 earnings press release and related prepared materials and our most recent filings with the SEC including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the Q2 2023 earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our Q2 results and our 2023 outlook, and we will then open it up for Q&amp;A. Noel?Story continuesNoel R. WallaceWell, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. So a few quick thoughts this morning on our strong quarter of top and bottom line growth and clearly along with the improved 2023 outlook we provided. On the first quarter call, you'll recall, I highlighted 3 priorities for the year: driving organic sales growth as we face tougher comparisons; executing on productivity and revenue growth management to fund brand investment while also delivering on our earnings targets; and improving our cash flow performance. While not without its challenges, in Q2, we made strong progress on all 3 of these. On organic sales growth, Q2 showed the strength of our global portfolio as we delivered our strongest quarterly growth on a 2-year stack basis since Q3 2008. with both organic volume and pricing growth accelerating on a 2-year stack basis. We delivered organic sales growth in all 6 divisions and in each of our categories grew in the mid-single digits or higher. We are laser-focused on returning to balanced organic sales growth, and we believe the investments we are making, combined with easier comparisons, give us a path to improved volume growth going forward as we leverage increased brand support and innovation while still delivering profit growth. The strength of our revenue growth management efforts, combined with our progress on funding the growth, drove improvement in our gross margin both sequentially and year-over-year. Our Base Business SG&amp;A was down 30 basis points in the quarter, a strong sales growth, lower logistics costs and the benefits of our 2022 global productivity initiative drove operating leverage even as we increased advertising spending by 20%. Combined with our gross margin expansion, we delivered 60 basis points of operating margin expansion in the quarter. This enabled us to deliver upside versus expectations in the quarter despite continued pressure from below-the-line items, including the impact of higher interest rates and tax. As you've heard me say, it's this virtuous combination of growth-driven leverage, revenue growth management, cost containment and productivity to drive investments in capabilities and brand building which drove the strong quality of this quarter's results. We believe it also lays the groundwork for our performance across the balance of the year and into the future. And finally, our strong cash flow performance continued in the quarter, which is helping us offset some of these below-the-line headwinds. Free cash flow was up more than 50% in the quarter and is more than up -- up more than 80% year-to-date through net income growth and improved working capital performance, and pleasingly, particularly in inventories and payables. So I'm pleased with how we started the year, but I'm also well aware of the challenges and uncertainty ahead of us. Our goal is to deliver consistent, high-quality compounded top and bottom line growth to drive shareholder value. And I believe Colgate-Palmolive has the brands, the global footprint and the people to deliver. So with that, I'll turn it over to the Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And Our first question today will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.Dara Warren MohsenianSo another impressive quarter of organic sales growth. And as you mentioned, the CAGR is accelerated on a multiyear basis, but it was driven by pricing more than entirely. And obviously, from here, we're going into a period where we're cycling higher pricing. So can you just talk about conceptually at a high level, how you think about the balance of organic sales growth going forward, level of visibilities that volume can come back as pricing drops off? And maybe within that question also, if you could just touch on the global Oral Care share and the performance in the quarter and prospects going forward. That would be helpful also.Noel R. WallaceSure. Thanks, Dara. So let me go back to a couple of the comments I made in my opening statement and really talk about how we're trying to work to improve the quality of the P&amp;L, which puts us in the best position to drive compounded long-term balanced growth top and bottom line, which is what we've been talking about for quite some time. As you know, we're coming out of what has been the worst raw material environment in decades. So our plan is with the combination of the revenue wealth management we talked about and the discipline that we're putting across the company in that area, more pricing and productivity, we can restore our gross margins. And that's been the key focus. We believe that if we exit this type of environment with a structurally lower gross margin, you're going to be in a hole that's very difficult to dig yourself out of in the future, particularly because you need the gross margin to fund the investment in capabilities and the brand building, which you certainly saw in the quarter. We want to grow margins while still investing behind our brands and sustain a consistent organic sales growth, which we're clearly demonstrating. The key to do is getting pricing in the P&amp;L. We certainly focused our teams on the ground in that area. Because the depth and duration of this cost inflation that we're experiencing has been an issue, and you simply can't do it with one round of pricing. It needs to be consistent and deliberate and purposeful. And now as we look at cost inflation slowing overall, there are still places where we see margin pressure. So we -- of course, we need to take additional pricing, and this has had an impact on the volume. Maybe a couple of examples. China is a good example. We've taken pricing on our Hawley &amp; Hazel joint venture in order to improve profitability long term to drive the necessary investments in digital, the premium innovation required in that market, and a continued shift to e-commerce. And as you know, China is a very difficult market in which to take pricing. And in the short term, that hasn't -- that's had an impact on our volume through lower promotions and wholesaler inventories as we look to set the new pricing in the market. But the long-term implications of not restoring margins are more problematic. I'd go on to North America as well, where we're working to improve the health of our business and our brands through shifting more consistent brand support from above the net revenue line to obviously into margin expansion. This will improve health of our brands and our P&amp;L. We're seeing this play out in our non-promoted share, which is growing, which is a healthy way to grow the business. In the short term, was the volume impact from reduced promotions more than we expected? Yes, it was. But the good news is we've adjusted the P&amp;L, we've strengthened it and we can adjust moving forward as we see the opportunities provide themselves. So while we're delivering both sales and profit growth along with increases in brand support in the middle of the P&amp;L, it's clearly a healthier way to drive the business. If I look at the Hill's business, we're still seeing high levels of cost inflation, as you've heard us talk about in the first quarter, and gross margins are still down year-over-year. So we've taken additional pricing to get the right margin structure for this business for the long term. Much of the Hill's volume decline in the quarter was in emerging markets as much of the time is due to go-to-market changes or shipments that we had. The good news is the EMEA or our Europe business, and particularly there we were strong, U.S. volumes were only down slightly in the quarter against a very difficult comparison with pricing as you saw up in the teens. But we're focused on getting Hill's back to volume growth the right way. This is a business that responds very well to science-driven innovation and strong advertising. We want to make sure that it's well funded and through the gross margin expansion that you've seen. And Hill's saw the biggest advertising increases in brand building in this quarter and will continue to fuel that investment. So I understand the importance of gaining volume growth, as you asked. We know we're all focused on that and as you are. But as I said, we want to do that in a way that sets us up structurally for long-term profitable growth. That means a good visibility towards restoring our gross margin to previous levels through revenue growth management and productivity that we've been talking about, well-funded advertising and the ability to drive operating leverage with the strong innovation that we're bringing to the market and healthier brands. So with a lot of great work by Colgate people, we have gross margin, overheads and logistics trending positively. We just finished the first half where we increased advertising by 17%. We have put additional pricing in place. We have strong innovation across all the divisions and categories. And we have second half volume comps that are easier by about 500 basis points. So we feel we're very well positioned. So with that, let me turn it over to the other questions.OperatorOur next question will come from Filippo Falorni of Citi.Filippo FalorniJust a follow-up on the prior question, Noel. You mentioned the need to take incremental pricing. Can you give us a little bit more color which category, country combination are you taking more pricing? What has been the response so far, and generally, like the magnitude relative to the prior price increases?Noel R. WallaceSure. And let me just come back to a quick finish on Dara's point. He asked about market shares. Dara, so our market share -- global market shares are up on toothpaste around the world. Strong growth obviously in Europe, a little softness in North America, as you've seen in the scanner data. And we're obviously addressing that as we go into the back half. Latin America shares look good. Asia shares look good. Africa shares look really, really strong. We're up or flat in all 11 markets where we read shares there. So overall, oral toothpaste shares are pretty good.Filippo, on your question regarding the pricing, certainly in some of the higher inflationary markets, we will probably still see pricing in the back half of the year. Take Turkey, take Argentina, take Pakistan and some of the other higher inflationary areas around the world. We took pricing in the second quarter in North America. Obviously, that had some impact on volume in the quarter, but we'll see deliberate and very focused pricing where we have margin pressure. On the Hill's business, clearly, we've seen ag prices accelerate through 2022 and into '23. So we're taking pricing commensurate with that as we move into the back half. But it will be more isolated and targeted the bigger price increases are in the P&amp;L. And as you heard us talk about, we took a lot of pricing in 2022. About 58% of the pricing in the P&amp;L this year is flow-through from last year. So we still have a little bit to go, but most of it is in the P&amp;L already.OperatorOur next question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.Bryan Douglass SpillaneNoel, maybe just kind of tying it back to Dara -- maybe this ties back to Dara's question. But in the prepared remarks, you talked about -- on a percentage of sales basis, SG&amp;A would be up in North America, Europe and Hill's to support volume acceleration. And I guess as we look through the results, it looks like it's been pretty good in Europe, like you've gained share. So maybe if you can, for some context, in terms of that investment, how much of it is -- like where has each of those geographies progressed relative to the investment? Is it right to read that you're having an impact in Europe and you still have some catch-up to do in North America? Just want to get some color on that.Noel R. WallaceAbsolutely. Thanks, Bryan. Yes, I'll start with Europe. Obviously, we've increased investment there, and we're seeing terrific response to particularly the elmex and meridol brands where we've elevated our investment there, but likewise, on the Colgate brand. So a lot of the efforts that we've had on premium whitening have played out to drive incremental share in Europe. So that investment across that business is certainly playing out. But importantly, the investment in Europe is broader based than just Oral Care. We have a wonderful relaunch on Sanex, that's underway across Europe. We're putting investment behind that. We relaunched our Soupline business in France, which is a big business for us. And we've launched the Suavitel, the Soupline Hearts, which we're putting investment behind that. So I think what's important is with operating margins back to growth, it's giving us a lot more flexibility to support a wide array of brands, particularly in Europe. And that would be the case likewise in Latin America, where we've obviously seen a little pickup in exchange. So on a local currency basis, we're getting more advertising. And I'd also point to the fact that we're getting more efficient and targeted with our advertising with some of our digital skills that we're implementing across the world. North America, it's taking a little bit more time. You certainly have seen the promoted share fall off. But as I mentioned in my comments to Dara, the important thing is our non-promoted volume share is growing. And that's a clear reflection of the fact that we've increased support on the brand and building the health of the brand. If you look at the attributes of the Colgate brand, particularly in North America, we're seeing good movements in terms of how we measure the health of the equity. So good news there. Asia, likewise, good response. We've obviously seen a falloff on our biggest business, which is Darlie due to the price increase. But the Colgate business overall, where we've added more support similarly is responding very, very well. And we couldn't be more happy with the progress we're seeing in Africa on the Oral Care business with the elevated increase that we're seeing. Advertising doesn't respond immediately. It takes quarters after quarters of consistent growth. And what's important, back to the quality of the P&amp;L, is that with the quality of the P&amp;L where it is, it allows us to sustain that advertising. In this quarter, you obviously saw us increase it. And that's clearly the strategy because over the long term, consistent levels of advertising play out for brands the best.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.Andrea Faria TeixeiraNoel, you mentioned the balanced volume and pricing, obviously, impressive to see some of the green shoots in Africa and Eurasia. Can you talk also about the brand support above the line you mentioned in North America and elaborate more on that? And obviously, that has been a main drag to global volumes. And I understand it takes time, of course, to see volume share rebound. But do you see in terms of like when should we see some improvement there as you talk to your customers? And then sorry to get a second part of the question, but I want to understand also your impressive rebound in margins in the quarter came through. Even looking at your prepared remarks, you mentioned raw material and packaging, you still ahead of 540 basis points negative impact. So I'm thinking about the cadence of this inflation, if you can comment and then how we can expect that from here? I know you reiterated margins up, but I just want to see to the P&amp;L, what would be the puts and takes there?Noel R. WallaceSure. Thanks, Andrea. So on above-the-line expenses, obviously, when you're in an environment of inflation and recovering cost and taking pricing either through list prices or revenue growth management, it involves a reallocation of your promotional dollars for 2 reasons. One, you want to ensure that when you're taking list price increases, you see that pricing in the market and you get consistency of implementation around the retail environment. So that was an important part of the second quarter pricing we took in North America. To do that, you need to pull back on some of your promotional volumes. That was done, one, because some of those promotional volumes are unprofitable. So as I mentioned earlier, we are very focused in North America on building brand health and getting back to consistent delivery of share growth with advertising and innovation through simply -- and simply taking some of the reliance on promotions away. Did we pull back a little bit too much perhaps but we're going to be very thoughtful moving forward on how we put grocery net back into the North America business, to ensure that we continue to grow margins and obviously grow share at the same time. But we will ensure that, that happens in the back half. But I can tell you that we're going to be very thoughtful on how we approach all the categories relative to promotions to ensure we maintain the margins in the P&amp;L. And around the world, I think we were quite consistent with the above the line where we had list price increases. We were managing promotions. We'll have a little bit easier comps as we've talked about on pricing -- harder comps on pricing in the back half but easier on volume. So I think we'll see a better balance between our organic growth as we move through the back half of the year, but we'll still see a little bit of pricing moving through, as I mentioned, upfront. On the margin line, clearly very pleased with the progress that we're making both at the gross profit level and the operating margin level. And I remind everyone that our gross profit does not include logistics and cost of goods. So if you take logistics, obviously, we had a very strong quarter relative to gross profit acceleration. And our SG&amp;A was down despite the fact that we took a 20% -- we implemented a 20% increase in advertising. Let me turn it over to Stan. He can give you a little bit of color on how we're thinking about raw materials phasing out through the balance of the second half.Stanley J. SutulaThanks, Noel. So raw materials, as we look towards the second half, we will see these moderate. But there are pockets that actually are going up, and predominantly, they're impacting Hill's. So around ag and proteins, those continue to escalate. So while on a year-on-year basis, these will moderate slightly coming off of the first half, there still will be a headwind in the second half of the year. Now we continue to drive funding the growth savings. The teams have done a really nice job on driving that productivity, and we will carry that through the back half of the year as well. So we do expect margin to improve in the second half and continue that momentum. And then obviously, just as we look at FX, it's going to bounce around here a bit. And in particular, we've seen pressure in Africa/Eurasia countries as well as Asia Pacific. So overall, we do expect margins to improve in the back half of the year.OperatorOur next question is from Olivia Tong of Raymond James.Olivia Tong CheangGreat. First, can you just elaborate a little bit on what the impact of logistics is just so we can kind of compare you to your peers? And then specifically on the U.S., could you just talk about the path forward? I mean, we talked about the -- what's driven some of the challenges so far in terms of volume. But could you talk about the actions that you're planning to take for the second half, whether it's some relaxation in terms of the pullback and reinstating perhaps some of the promotion or other actions that you're planning to take with respect to the U.S.Noel R. WallaceSure. Thanks, Olivia. I'd ask you to reference the Q on details on logistics. There's a lot more detail in there. And if you're not finding what you need, obviously follow-up with John and Stan afterwards. On the volume cadence, certainly, as you look at the back half, as I mentioned, the comps get much easier. But despite that, we're going to be very deliberate in how we think about volume creation in the back half. We're going to be thoughtful, as I mentioned, continuing to focus on the structure of the P&amp;L, which we believe is absolutely imperative for the long-term sustainability of the company. We think that we can keep the gross margin accelerating, we'll keep the advertising in the P&amp;L, and not simply chasing unprofitable volume. So we're going to be very focused on that. That being said, we do expect a slightly heightened promotional environment in the back half. As cost tend to level out, we'll see probably a little bit more promotions. I will say that around the world today, we have not seen an elevated promotional environment. We are recently starting to see more volume being sold on promotions but not the frequency of promotions there or the depth of promotions in the market. So that's an important aspect. But we're going to be very deliberate in how we think about the promotional cadence in the back half, probably a little bit more in the U.S. But the rest of the world will be very targeted where we see competitive needs to put more money there. But so far, it's been quite constructive. And we continue to believe pushing our brands through innovation and top -- and advertising is the healthiest way to grow the business longer term.OperatorOur next question will come from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.Jason M. EnglishStan mentioned earlier the elevated degree of inflation that's continuing to impact but also the new price increases. How should we expect them to translate into margins? I mean, it's good to see the moderation in gross margin expansion this quarter. But we're still down a lot from where we were. What is the right level of profitability for that business on a normalized basis? And what is the pathway to getting there?Noel R. WallaceYes. Thanks, Jason. So again, we are taking aggressive pricing across the Hill's business, as you've seen through the recent quarters, and we continue to see some inflationary prices on ag prices. Now do we think that's going to continue into '24? Unlikely, but we want to assure we continue to take pricing this year to recover that. Is there a number that we're targeting? No. We want to continue to do this in a very thoughtful way. We see real opportunities to continue to grow both gross profit and operating margin at Hill's in a healthy way quarter-to-quarter moving out, particularly given the pricing that we'll see flow through the back half of the P&amp;L and hopefully a more benign cost environment. We also have mixed opportunities that we're very focused on as we get the new Tonganoxie plan up and running and the wet -- and we get wet capacity building that will allow a little bit of margin accretion on mix. So we're pleased with that. We're getting the productivity through the plants operating more efficiently. So we'll see that. And obviously, as the private label business comes off, that will be a natural organic accretion to both gross profit and operating profit at the end. So good aspects to -- as we see the business projecting over time. We're going to ensure that we're competitive relative to pricing in the market. We're going to continue to ensure that we keep the high levels of advertising there on the Hill's business, which you saw in the quarter. So overall, we feel pretty good about the phasing of gross profit accretion moving forward.OperatorOur next question will come from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.Stephen Robert R. PowersI wanted to ask more of a general question on the state of the advertising industry as you see it. You talked obviously making increases, the 20% increase this quarter. I guess the question I'm left with is just how you're seeing the efficacy of that advertising. Do you believe the efficacy is up commensurate with the increased dollar investment? Or is there inflation or other dynamics cutting into that efficacy just as you see the environment today as you plan ahead?Noel R. WallaceYes. Thanks, Steve. I'll take you back to CAGNY. When Yves presented a lot of our digital advancement and the digital transformation and ultimately how our focus on digital advertising is yielding a much higher ROI, we have the ability to analytically measure that much more effectively than we have in the past. Our copy effectiveness is getting much better. So we're seeing the efficacy delivered there through the brand health measures that I talked about earlier. We're obviously spending more money on generating first-party data. That allows us to obviously look more holistically across the market and get more targeted media that's more personalized and effective, which has been terrific. And as I mentioned upfront, the non-promoted volume share in the U.S. is a big metric for us, because that clearly indicates that our advertising is driving more non-promoted share. So we were up about 100 basis points in non-promoted share. And that's excellent. That's exactly what we want. Now we may have pulled back, as I mentioned, a little too much on the promotion, but we'll get the balance right as we move forward. So the efficacy overall, we're very pleased. And that's clearly demonstrated in some of the market share performances we have around the world where we've had elevated advertising to support that, particularly across some of the brands -- non-Colgate brands. I mentioned Sanex in Europe. We talked about the Suavitel business and the Axion business in Mexico, which is obviously well supported. So overall, we see a more healthy balance of advertising across our categories. And over time, this is going to lead to more sustainable growth.OperatorOur next question will come from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.Robert Edward OttensteinGreat. A quick follow-up and then my other question. Where your volumes are down, particularly in the U.S.? Has that gone to competitors? Or is it more of a function of consumers postponing purchase or orders being postponed? So that's just kind of the follow-up. And then my main question is where you see yourself in digital and e-commerce. Arguably, a few years ago, you were unsatisfied and have made a lot of investments, and they're certainly panning out particularly in China. Do you believe that you're kind of where you need to be, to be fully competitive globally in digital and e-commerce now?Noel R. WallaceYes. Thanks, Rob. So on the volume, particularly in the U.S., as I mentioned already, we saw some -- our promoted share fall off across a couple of our categories in the U.S. as we pulled back on some of the promotions and established some of the new pricing. Where it's gone to is a multitude of the competitors, obviously, where they have not pulled back on their promotional levels as much. And therefore, we saw a little bit of migration to them. But clearly, that consumer typically responds to promotions, whether it's couponing or otherwise. And they're not that difficult to get back, but we want to get -- we want to get those consumers back in a much healthier way moving forward. So the overall structure of the U.S. P&amp;L improves, and that's pretty consistent around the world. When you pull back on promotions, you're going to have a highly driven consumer that looks at pricing and value, and you need to ensure that you're obviously providing that value moving forward. So we'll get the balance right. Our digital -- on that, we've talked a lot about our digital transformation. Yes, 3 years ago, we weren't where we needed to be. And I would say we're very, very pleased with where we are today. We do an external study with BCG, which assesses all of our peer group vis-a-vis their digital capabilities. And 3 years ago, we were below the peer group. Today, we are above the peer group. And we're not best-in-class yet, so we feel we've got more room to go. And Brigitte and Diana and Prabha and all the operating units are very focused on this, and we feel we've got good plans in place to continue to advance that. And our goal is absolutely to become best-in-class.OperatorNext question is from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.Lauren Rae LiebermanGreat. I was hoping to maybe talk a little bit about Latin America. I know it's a market where you've been putting a lot of premium innovation in place. It's been a core part of the strategy, particularly in Oral Care. And yet there's significant inflation in some markets. So I was just curious for an update there maybe on premiumization versus affordability, what you're seeing in terms of consumer trends outside of the reported results, but kind of what the dynamics are from a consumer environment standpoint and how you're managing those 2 ends of the pricing ladder.Noel R. WallaceYes. Thanks, Lauren. So you saw the results, another strong organic sales growth for Latin America. And pleasingly, after 5 quarters of double-digit pricing, we saw volume improve in Latin America. And I think this is a good proxy for as we think about pricing in other markets and coupling that with strong advertising, ultimately the volume will come back. It's a quite resilient consumer. They're accustomed to inflationary pricing. But as long as you're bringing a collection of strong innovation and continuing their brand support, which is vitally important to come out of these tougher times with stronger brands, you see the volume return to category. So both Mexico and Brazil delivered volume growth in the quarter and both had very strong growth organically given the fact that they also took pricing. So overall, really pleased with what we're seeing in Latin America. And likewise, we're seeing the velocity and the turns improve more than we anticipated given some of the inflationary pressures in those markets. Now we shall watch it very carefully as the inflation continues to mount. But overall, structurally the P&amp;Ls are in good shape, and the consumer seems to be quite responsive to the innovation and the pricing that we're putting in the market. So overall, we feel we're in a very good place.OperatorQuestion is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel.Mark Stiefel AstrachanWanted to ask a question on the Hill's business. Again, just maybe thinking about category in your business. So how are you thinking -- or what are you observing from the category standpoint? We can obviously see somewhat U.S. data, but curious how you think about it around the world, that volumes overall are a little bit weaker. How much of that is a reflection of just all the pricing that you and your competitors are taking? Is there some of just sort of pause within the category over the -- after the last couple of years of really strong growth and adoption levels? And then longer term, how do you think about -- and maybe this goes to Jason's question a little bit, but how do you think about the contribution to price and mix and volumes for that business over time? And how does that contribute to improving margins relative to where we are.Noel R. WallaceYes. Thanks, Mark. So clearly, another strong quarter for Hill's, double-digit organic sales growth. despite lapping. And I remind everyone that we're lapping 18% growth in the year ago period. So obviously, a really strong quarter. And the quarter a year ago was mid-single-digit volume, so ultimately, a good quarter. And on a 2-year stack, we were up. So looking quite strong. Categories softened a little bit towards the end of the category -- I mean, excuse me, the end of the quarter. You would expect that given the amount of pricing that's gone into that over the last 3 or 4 quarters. But overall, Europe continues to be very strong. U.S., strong despite very high comps. We anticipate that we'll see a little bit of sluggishness as we move forward in the categories, only because of all the pricing that's been taken. But that will be more around the discretionary items in pet specialty than food. Nutrition seems to be okay. I walked stores with some of the CEOs of the big pet specialty retailers recently, and they seem quite bullish relative to the nutritional and particularly the premium segment of the market, where you don't see a live elasticity in terms of when consumers trade off of diets, particularly on our prescription side. But we're going to have to watch that quite carefully because there's been a lot of pricing that's going into the category. Emerging markets continues to be a real growth opportunity for us. It's small for us right now, but we need to continue to focus on those opportunities, particularly in Latin America -- in Southeast Asia, to a certain extent. So overall, you'll see us focus on those moving forward. But the categories continue to be quite robust, particularly given the growth headwind -- growth head space that we have in emerging markets given we don't have high penetration there. So overall, we feel pretty good, but we're cautious on ultimately how the category continues to evolve from a volume standpoint as we see a lot of pricing going in those categories. But again, getting the P&amp;L structured right, getting gross margin up consistently over the next couple of quarters will be very important for us to maintain the high advertising levels that are so critical to drive penetration in that category.OperatorOur next question is from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities.Christopher Michael CareySo just a couple quick follow-ups for me. Just -- and apologies for asking a North America question. This is more about making sure expectations are set and we know how to think about this going forward. But a little bit of promotions come back in, but you're really focusing on a more sustainable total P&amp;L. Could still see some volume pressure for a bit until you lap some of these strategy adjustments that you made. And by the time we get beyond that, perhaps the volumes start to smooth out a bit more. So am I characterizing that correctly? And then second, just a quick clarification or follow-up. Olivia asked a question about freight. I think the 10-Q just says the year-over-year change. Stan, you had said 9.5% of sales was the freight number in Q1, and you expected it to trend low 9s for the rest of the year. Did that come through in the quarter? So thanks so much on those 2 items.Noel R. WallaceLet me -- Stan answer the logistics question, then I'll get back to your North American question.Stanley J. SutulaYes. So logistics is playing out like we expected and improved slightly from the previous quarter. And we expect that, that improvement will also continue in the second half.Noel R. WallaceOn -- Chris, on North America, so I think you said it well. I mean, we're looking very deliberately to improve the structure of that P&amp;L as we move forward. Again, it's the inherent objective there is to improve brand health. So we will clearly continue to fund advertising. We will be very choiceful on where we start to look at elevating promotions to recover some of that promotional share. Our focus is driving non-promoted share moving forward. But we need to be careful that we're not pulling back too much there. So we'll monitor that moving forward. And we'll see. I think from quarter-to-quarter, there will be a little bit of volatility in the gross margin line as we move forward as we see costs ultimately level out and where the pricing and the mix ends up. But we feel good about the back half relative to our ability to continue to drive operating margin expansion. I remind everyone that North America -- the North America HPC business is about 20% of our total business. And what is so nice about the Colgate business is that we have such diversity of our business around the world that as we need to fund opportunities in North America or Asia, we will have the ability to pull from certain regions around the world. So we're well balanced in that regard. And I think North America has a good plan for the back half, and we'll be very deliberate on their spending, and their focus on recovering some of the share loss that we've had in the quarter.OperatorOur last question will come from Peter Grom of UBS.Peter K. GromSo I wanted to just circle back to the top line growth, which the second half organic sales guidance is still relatively wide and implies a decent flow, which makes sense as you start to cycle pricing. Can you maybe just talk about the moving pieces that would put organic revenue growth at the higher end or the lower end of that range as we move forward here? And maybe specifically, you mentioned several times throughout this call the sequential improvement on a 2-year stack for volume. And just given the step up in investment and innovation, should we expect that trend to continue as we move into the back half of the year?Noel R. WallaceYes. So it's tough to nail down exactly how the balance will end up. I mean, we'll have to watch it very carefully. It's going to differ by category and by geography. But clearly, the comps get easier from a volume standpoint in the back half. You heard me mention around 500 basis points. So that will certainly be a nice tailwind for us. And obviously, the comps on pricing get a little bit more challenging in the back half as we move forward. But we feel very good relative to the guidance that we provided and comfortable that we can achieve that. We'll see how the categories behave as the consumer continues to be rather fickle around the world. But as I mentioned, it's been very constructive promotionally. And so far, the resilience, particularly in markets like Latin America, and to a certain extent, Africa, had been very, very good where we've taken a lot of pricing. We'll watch North America quite closely. And obviously, we think we continue to have a lot of hedge based on the Hill's business as we continue to drive penetration and share growth, which, incidentally, I didn't talk shares on Hill's. They continue to respond very, very well with share growth in the quarter across most of our recipes, which is terrific. So we feel good about where we are in the guidance and we'll see where it ultimately ends up. Obviously, if there's upside, we'll take it. But we feel good that we're in a range that is responsible to continuing to keep the structure of the P&amp;L the way it is. A relative to the second part of your question was on was on advertising, Peter? Or what was it on?Peter K. GromNo, it was just the sequential improvement on a 2-year stack basis. Just recognizing that the comps get easier, if the 2-year stack improves, what does that actually imply? Because it would seem to imply it does improve that there could be some nice improvement in return to volume growth in the back half of the year?Noel R. WallaceYes, exactly. And you said it well. I think we'll start to see a return to volume growth in the back half of the year. The 2-year stacks, as I mentioned upfront, have continued to accelerate. We'll have to -- my expectation, you'd probably see that moderate a bit as we move through the back half. But volumes will improve. And as I mentioned, we still have some pricing coming through that we've taken this year, so we'll see the benefit of that, and a little bit of the flow-through from last year. So overall, I think we'll have a more balanced composition as we move through the back half of the year.OperatorThis concludes the Q&amp;A portion of the call.Noel R. WallaceOkay, I think that's -- great. Well, thank you, everyone, and thanks for the questions this morning. We continue to appreciate your interest in our company. Clearly, we had a strong quarter, and I hope you agree, the strategies and the plans in place to deliver consistent compounded profitable growth are there, and that will allow us to drive increased shareholder value. We couldn't do this without the incredible efforts from Colgate people all over the world, who continue to focus on execution of our strategy and the consistency of delivery. So I thank them and I look forward to talking to everyone in the third quarter.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.]"
222,d5c0f530-e621-35f7-bd23-7be4ca49bff0,CL,2023-07-29,10 Recession-Proof Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-recession-proof-stocks-billionaires-235457192.html,1690588497,STORY,"['JNJ', 'AAPL', 'ELV', 'CL', 'KO']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 10 recession-proof stocks billionaires are loading up on. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Recession-Proof Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.Latest data on inflation has upped the hopes of investors as market naysayers who had been warning of recession for several months are on the back foot now. Since inflation is still high and far above the Federal Reserve’s target, many still believe we can see a moderate recession in the coming months. But now there are many ifs and buts before such recession calls. For example, in June, talking to Bloomberg, Newedge Wealth's Cameron Dawson said that she expects a 350-point drop in the S&amp;P 500 in the next six months. She said the recession expectations could be “realistic” if you “start to see the whites of the eyes of a recession showing up."" But she also said that if earnings continue to show resiliency “then maybe that doesn't look like something that's in the cards.""Similarly, Tony Crescenzi, executive VP at investment management firm Pimco, said that he believes the US is already in a “growth recession.” Simply put, according to Crescenzi, growth recession is when the economy is not growing at its true potential and demand is lower than supply.He believes the US has the potential for an annual growth of 1.8% but he believes currently the growth is below that. However, there’s a silver lining here. Crescenzi thinks this growth recession would give supply a chance to catchup with demand. When the gap between supply and demand will narrow, the Federal Reserve won’t need to keep increasing interest rates.“The Fed could say we needn't raise interest rates any more, and if supply catches up enough, in a growth recession it can happen, then eventually there are interest-rate cuts,” Crescenzi said, in an interview with Bloomberg.In its Q3 outlook report, American Century Investments said that it takes time for monetary policy actions to show their real effects. The report said that while the economy is still strong and unemployment is low, there are areas that are slowing as the firm said it believes “ a recession awaits us down the road.” American Century said that it isn’t alone in its skepticism of policymakers’ ability to control inflation without triggering a recession. The report quoted former Fed economist Claudia Sahm who said that a recession was expected for a long time but  “we’re finally getting to the moment of truth.”Story continuesThe report also quoted American Century’s interview with former Kansas City Fed President Esther George who thinks that while the Fed’s intention is obviously not to trigger a recession, in case we experience a recession, it would not be the first time rate hikes have triggered one.American Century Investments also said that in light of expectations that inflation is here to stay, investors should protect their portfolios from inflation. And for that they should look for solid companies. Here’s what the report said:“Against a recessionary backdrop, we think equity style distinctions are less important. We’re emphasizing quality instead. This means we’re focusing more on companies with stable revenues, repeatable profits, low indebtedness, stable cash flows and predictable business models less sensitive to economic conditions.”However, the report does not paint all doom and gloom. It also said that in the second half of 2023 earnings are expected to remain strong amid lowering inventory of semiconductors and increasing economic activity in China and Asia.The report further highlights that while the markets rallied earlier this year, there is a lot of optimism among investors that the Federal Reserve might start cutting rates down the road. American Century believes this is not a correct presumption. The report said that investors should continue to invest in businesses that are positioned to gain in the long term instead of focusing on short-term, assumption-based dynamics of the market.Wells Fargo also published its mid-year outlook 2023 report in June. Wells Fargo said that the bear markets of 2022 and 2023 are expected to evolve into recession in the back half of 2023 or early 2024. Wells Fargo said that this would be the most predicted and longest anticipated recession. Wells Fargo said that economic cycles are natural and what’s important for investors is to position their portfolios accordingly.“Our guidance — to remain defensive in portfolio positioning — has remained consistent through this period, and we reiterate that guidance in our 2023 Midyear Outlook.”Wells Fargo also believes that after 2023 recession earnings will expand in 2024 and valuations will rebound. The bank said in its report that investors should prefer quality stocks, which have “sound balance sheets, strong levels of profitability and cash flow, the ability to generate consistent growth, and earnings stability.”“As is typical, equity prices likely will increase at a much more rapid pace than earnings can recover, leading to price/earnings (P/E) multiple spikes and above-average valuations in 2024. However, once the earnings recovery catches up to the price recovery during the back half of next year, we expect multiples to revert to average levels. The following chart illustrates how our view of earnings and multiple expansion could combine to drive returns this year and next, and how this expected interplay relates to history. It shows calendar-year contributions to return for the S&amp;P 500 Index from 2007 to 2022 as well as our forecasts for 2023 and 2024.”Recession-Proof Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnOur MethodologyBillionaires have also been anticipating a recession and it’s always interesting to see how they are positioning their portfolios according to market environment. For this article we first scanned and listed all stock holdings of the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund (VIG), which is considered among the top defensive ETFs investors prefer during recessionary environments. For each stock holding of the ETF, we looked for the number of billionaires having stakes in them using Insider Monkey’s comprehensive data of billionaire-owned stocks. We then picked 10 of these stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.Recession-Proof Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On10.

Elevance is the largest for-profit Blue Cross Blue Shield plan in the country, supporting the largest domestic membership base across the managed care industry.

Elevance scores well on both fronts, giving it strong bargaining power with providers, lower customer acquisition costs, deep population health data and analytics, and the ability to offer attractive health benefit packages. All this combines to create a formidable moat for its business.We also believe the management team is top-notch. Since joining Elevance from a senior leadership position at peer UnitedHealth Group, CEO Gail Boudreaux has further leveraged the company’s scale advantage by expanding its internal healthcare services capabilities through a newly formed business unit called Carelon. As the industry transitions to a reimbursement system that emphasizes patient outcomes over procedure or testing volume, data analytics will be a crucial tool in managing patient care. Carelon has become the repository for many of these data analytics and healthcare service capabilities, and it should be an attractive growth platform for many years to come.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Safe Haven Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.US markets surged on July 12 after fresh data showed clear signs that inflation is cooling. This was yet another blow to analysts who were vehemently making predictions about recession for about a year now. Last month, after a separate report from the US government on economic data, Yardeni Research’s Ed Yardeni said that the “permabears will have to postpone their imminent recession yet again based on today’s batch of US economic indicators.” The analyst said that the “rolling recession” was becoming “rolling expansion.”Positive economic is also causing research institutes to improve their forecasts on the US economy. For example, Bloomberg’s survey of economists now expect real gross domestic product to be roughly flat next quarter on an annualized basis. This is much better than their previous forecast of a 0.9% decline.But all of this does not mean that the US economy is totally out of recession risk. In fact many believe the economy is still expected to suffer recession but later than expected. A Bloomberg survey still sees a 64% probability of a recession in the next 12 months.This is where defensive and safe haven investments come in. They are not for the recessions only. Wise investors pile into defensive stocks and safe haven assets to hedge against risks and volatility of the market. While gold is deemed as a safe haven asset, it failed to impress investors ever since the rate-hike spree began to hammer the financial markets. On the other hand, safe haven stocks such as defensive companies operating in evergreen sectors posted strong performance in 2022. An important thing to note here is that while billionaire investors showed an increased interest in safe haven and defensive stocks amid recession fears, many of the notable companies that are deemed defensive had been receiving love from billionaire hedge funds since way before the topic of recession started making headlines. Some examples of such solid stocks are Johnson &amp; Johnson, Coca Cola and UnitedHealth. These stocks have been popular among the elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey for years. These companies not only pay consistent dividends, they also have organic growth catalysts and products that are apparently safe from recession environment.Story continuesDespite positive data and a rally in stocks investors have been wary of going all in in the stock market. However, they are putting money in defensive ETFs. A WSJ report quoted Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street, who said:“There’s been a lack of expression of risk during this market rally. There hasn’t been a lot of conviction, and where there is, it’s mainly been into areas of the market you would consider defensive.”Defensive Stocks in Non-Recessionary Environment?When beginner investors make an effort to find defensive stocks, they often tend to focus on metrics like beta and the nature of industries. But data shows that low beta stocks are not always undervalued and one must pay attention to other metrics while choosing defensive plays. For example, when the stock market began to rally in 2023, defensive stocks fell, and their valuations became attractive. Even though the economy is coming out of recession risks, these defensive companies with strong fundamentals and great valuations are still attractive and could reward long-term investors who aren’t just looking for defensive stocks in panic to protect them from the next recession.A 2019 report from State Street Global Advisors mentions an interesting perspective in this regard:“Looking at the valuation of each of the conventionally defensive sectors, we see that the utilities and real estate segments as a whole are trading on a multiple of forecast earnings around 2 points higher than their long-term average. The utilities stocks in the low beta group on average are currently trading at a multiple of 19 times earnings, and the real estate and food &amp; beverage segments are trading at an average of 30 and 21 times earnings, respectively. When we think about investing defensively, risk measures are not enough. Valuation is also important, as are measures of financial strength, growth capability, or other measures of company quality. And the individual assessment of each stock is also not enough. Consideration of the interaction of stocks with one another (correlation) matters, too.”Despite the changing nature of market conditions, billionaire investors almost always maintain exposure to defensive stocks operating in industries like consumer staples, healthcare, utilities, energy, etc. The reason behind this is simple. Most of the notable defensive companies have stable, mature businesses. When financial markets get choppy and storms gather, defensive companies don’t waver. Asset management firm Robeco in a report mentioned that during the period between January 1929 to May 2023, defensive stocks were less volatile and had a lower risk profile when compare to cyclical stocks. The report said that defensive stocks (with beta value of 0.75) “respond less to market movements compared to cyclical stocks with a higher beta of 1.27. This lower sensitivity makes defensive stocks an attractive option for investors seeking to mitigate their exposure to market fluctuations.""Safe Haven Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnOur MethodologyFor this article, we first scanned the DEF - Invesco Defensive Equity ETF and listed all its holdings.

The company showed that it is maintaining margins and beating earnings estimates on strong sales and by selectively raising prices. TJX’s business model is to sell brand name and designer merchandise in limited quantities at every day discounted prices in stores with flexible, low-cost layouts. Its strategy is to tap into shoppers’ psychological need to “treasure hunt,” as the company describes it, to find unique, branded items at deep discounts. TJX buyers opportunistically purchase merchandise from vendors at deep discounts to keep the cost of goods low for stores. As the largest off-price retailer, the company has used its channel power to its advantage in recent months to gain steep discounts on merchandise as other retailers struggle to clear their inventory. We appreciate the company’s inventory management and pricing  prowess.

226,5afdde82-7eb2-3e6e-aa0c-531d4b082c7e,CL,2023-07-29,Oil up 5th week ahead of OPEC meet; resistance building,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-5th-week-ahead-opec-150300409.html,1690556580,STORY,"['CL', 'SCO', 'UCO', 'CL=F']","[Investing.com - Non-stop chanting about Saudi output cuts; forecast-beating U.S. economic growth and fewer Americans filing unemployment claims despite moderating jobs growth — oil has little reason not to rally.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude, along with London-based Brent oil both finished up for a fifth straight week, riding the rhetoric that supply was getting critically tight versus supply — although weekly petroleum data from the U.S. government barely supported that notion.But after a gain of as much as 14% for July alone, the rally is beginning to show some strain.The market treaded water most of Friday before settling higher towards the end. Earlier, longs in the game appeared undecided on whether to take profit and re-enter with new positions on Monday or hold on hold for another week till next Friday’s OPEC meeting where more jawboning on oil prices was expected.“OPEC knows it has a good thing going and it’s unlikely to pass up on the opportunity to use the hailer again to drive home the messaging of the perma cuts by the Saudis,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital. “Oil bulls also know that the cuts mantra will be echoing all of next week and that explains why so few want to take profit in today’s session.”The Saudis have pledged to take an additional million barrels per day off their production for all this month — and possibly forever — if that meant keeping the market above $80 a barrel at any time.That promise is a powerful motivator for oil bulls as Saudi production would theoretically drop by a total of 2.5 million barrels daily from their norm of 9.5 million a day. With cuts pledged by Russia and nine other oil producers participating in the production squeeze by the 13-member OPEC, the market is missing at least 4.0 million barrels per day in daily supply.Despite the widely-bandied about production cut numbers, weekly petroleum inventory data released by the U.S. government show a market getting by each week with more supply than thought — as well as light demand for fuel in what ought to be runaway consumption for the summer.Story continuesAt Friday’s close, WTI for delivery in September settled up 49 cents, or 0.6%, at $80.58 a barrel. The U.S. crude benchmark hit a new three-month high of $80.69 during the session, extending Thursday’s peak. For the week, it rose 4.6% after a cumulative gain of 11.4% over four prior weeks. With just another session left for July, WTI was also up 14% for the month.Brent for October delivery settled up 75 cents, or 0.9%, at $84.99 per barrel. The global crude benchmark finished the week up 4.8%, adding to the prior four-week gain of 9.8%. For July, Brent showed a gain of more than 12%.While there is no immediate threat of a reversal to the oil rally — not with an OPEC meeting round the corner — WTI was slowly headed toward the key resistance of $86, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“Holding above the 5-day EMA of $79.10 is a precondition for continuation of current bullish momentum,” Dixit said, referring to the Exponential Moving Average.He said the next immediate target of oil longs would be the 100-week SMA, or Simple Moving Average, of $85.30 and the monthly Middle Bollinger Band of $86.40“These two levels are likely to act as the resistance zone in mid-term,” he added.Related ArticlesOil up 5th week ahead of OPEC meet; resistance buildingOil posts fifth week of gains on signals of tighter supplyCold War-era atomic bomb site could host largest US solar development]"

In an interview with Yahoo Finance Live, Procter and Gamble CEO Jon Moeller says the ""consumer remains strong"" and that they are looking for brands they know and trust. P&amp;G does stand to benefit from a decline in commodity prices, with Moeller pointing specifically to the decline in petro and pulp prices, but he says labor costs and foreign exchange remain headwinds.Video Transcript- An improved inflation outlook and higher prices on products such as Tide led Procter &amp; Gamble to a better than expected fiscal fourth quarter, though the consumer goods business gave a fiscal 2024 outlook short of Wall Street's expectations. Sales and profit grew in all of the company's segments in the quarter and the shares right now are trading higher. Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi spoke with P&amp;G CEO John Muller on how he sees these results.JON MOELLER: Very strong. 8% organic sales growth, every category growing, five of the categories, so half of our portfolio growing double digits. 7 out of 10 categories building share. If you look at it on a geographic basis, same general story, every region growing. The US, our largest market, we grew 6% value share up 20 basis points, volume share up 50 basis points.And importantly, volume, which is going to be an increasingly important component of top line, is coming around. Take the US, for example, last quarters minus 3, minus 3, 0, plus 3 in the quarter we just completed. Strong earnings growth. 13% core earnings per share growth, 22% excluding currency. That all sets us up very well from a momentum standpoint as we head into our next fiscal year, which started 29 days ago.BRIAN SOZZI: Talk to us about the volume declines in some of the businesses. Are you seeing a softening US shopper?JON MOELLER: No. If you look on a global aggregate basis in the quarter we just completed, volume was minus 1. So very, very modest decline, which you would expect with the level of pricing that we've been taking. And as I mentioned, in the US, our largest market, volume plus 3. So consumer remains strong. They continue to value brands that are known and trusted that perform in categories where we focus our portfolio, where performance drives brand choice.Story continuesSo it's been a good, gratifying experience overall in terms of the strategy that we've been executing to build superiority of our brands, product package, communication, go-to market, and value, and that's being reflected in consumer behavior.BRIAN SOZZI: P&amp;G has been in the enviable position, John, of having relatively smaller exposure to private label brands. I believe the stat from Evercore pegged it at about 18% of your portfolio leveraged to, or just competes, with private label. But within that 18%, in that number, I mean, do you see consumers trading down to private label?JON MOELLER: There are some consumers who are, but again, we're building share so that dynamic isn't pronounced by any stretch of the imagination. And we've given them an easier trade down path, if they choose it, within our portfolio, as we've extended the brands take tide, for example, now with the offering of Tide Simply, which we didn't have in the last economic turndown. So if they need to trade down, they can do it within our brands and maintain a very high performance level. There's some trade down to private label, but I think if you look over the last three years, we're talking small basis point increases in share while we've been simultaneously building share.BRIAN SOZZI: One number that jumps off this page-- and we haven't had we haven't been able to talk about this in some time, maybe two years lower, commodities cost, John. Wow. Within your next guidance, you've built-in $400 million in savings. I almost didn't think the day would ever come. Where are you seeing the biggest declines commodity wise?JON MOELLER: In the petro complex and in pulp are the primary areas. It's not all one way. There are commodities that continue to increase. Obviously, we're dealing with other cost pools as well, where the markets are tight like labor. And there's a significant foreign exchange headwinds still, about the same number, about $400 million after tax as we head into next year. So it's not all about roses, but it's a lot better looking than it was last year at this time, and our guidance reflects that.BRIAN SOZZI: Are you seeing-- I think it was this week. Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey coined it intense inflation overseas. Are you seeing that overseas in your markets, and then the US inflation picture starting to moderate?JON MOELLER: Well, definitely, the US picture is moderating some. There's still significant inflation in Europe, which may have been what James was referring to. And obviously, with a very unfortunate situation in the Eastern part of that continent, there's continued pressure on pricing just from a supply standpoint.BRIAN SOZZI: In terms of pricing, P&amp;G and a lot of other consumer products, Giants, have been able to push through higher prices the past two years to offset some of that inflation. But well, now that it's slowing down, what do you do with prices? Are you able to take them down? Do you want to take them down? I mean, how do you think about it?JON MOELLER: Pricing has been a positive component of our top line growth for 49 out of the last 51 quarters. So it's part of our business model, which is driven by innovation, and to the extent that we can bring better, referred, more delightful products and experiences to consumers. There's a modest amount of pricing that that affords.BRIAN SOZZI: How would you grade the Chinese economy right now? Of course, you have exposure there through various segments. That economy, from the outside looking in, looks to have really slowed down. What are you seeing?JON MOELLER: Well, versus six months ago, it's really picked up. Versus 4, 5 years ago, it's a little bit slower. But we grew our business in China 4%. I expect that number to continue to increase modestly as we move on. But things are picking up.BRIAN SOZZI: Over the next 12 months, John, before I let you go, what products should investors most be excited about? We've talked repeatedly about increasing innovation at P&amp;G. Do you have more breakthrough stuff coming?JON MOELLER: We always do. I'm not going to talk about future innovation, but you and I were talking before. We went on the air about our Dawn business, our hand dishwashing business, where we've had two major innovations, Dawn Powerwash and the Easy Squeeze bottle, the upside-down bottle. And behind those innovations across the US and Europe, we grew that business 17% last year. We built share 1 and 1/2 points in the US, 1.1 points, I think, the number was in Europe. So the team is constantly looking for ways to bring further delight to consumers, and I think those are two examples of doing that very well.BRIAN SOZZI: That brings up another good point. How does your team find some of these use cases? Because they ultimately help you to drive a higher price, higher sales, and better earnings. I didn't know I needed soap sprayed out of a bottle. I didn't know I needed a capless bottle, but to me it makes a lot of sense. What is the origin story of these things?JON MOELLER: The majority of it is just a proximity to and a deep understanding of consumers and their attention points. And once we understand those tension points, we try to solve them. So take the capitalist bottle. I don't know about you, but for years when I've watched this, it's kind of a messy experience, and the cap gets covered with the product over time, and no one likes that. So that's attention point, and our team was able to identify a solution.It wasn't easy, but generally overcame that issue and made it even easier to wash by just simply taking the bottle and dispensing as opposed to having to turn it upside-down. So these are little things that make a difference. And when you can solve them and do it in a delightful way, good things happen.- And that was John Mueller who was the CEO.]"

JNPR reported solid second-quarter 2023 results, with the bottom and top lines beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company reported a top-line expansion year over year, driven by the solid momentum in AI-Driven Enterprise solutions and healthy demand trends in Enterprise vertical. An improvement in logistic and supply-chain costs supported the top line. However, declining trends in Cloud vertical and macroeconomic headwinds partially impeded revenue growth.Net IncomeQuarterly net income, on a GAAP basis, declined to $24.4 million or 7 cents per share from $113.4 million or 35 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. Despite a top-line improvement, higher costs of revenues and operating expenses led to a decline in the net income.Non-GAAP net income was $189 million or 58 cents per share compared with the respective figures of $136.4 million or 42 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.Juniper Networks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseJuniper Networks, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Juniper Networks, Inc. QuoteRevenuesTotal revenues were $1,430.1 million, up from $1269.6 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,419 million. Solid growth in the Enterprise vertical and growing adoption of AI-Driven Enterprise solutions boosted the top line. However, declining trends in Cloud vertical partially reversed this trend.Product revenues stood at $963.2 million compared with $839.8 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The top line surpassed our revenue estimate of $917.1 million. Net sales from Service were $466.9 million, up from $429.8 million in the year-ago quarter backed by the healthy demand for SaaS and software subscriptions. Net sales fell short of our revenue estimate of $497 million.By vertical, Cloud revenues declined to $311 million from $331 million in the prior-year quarter. The top line fell short of our revenue estimate of $332.7 million. Weakness in Cloud Ready Data Center and Automated WAN solutions induced the decline in this vertical. However, the declining trend was partially reversed by strength in AI-Driven Enterprise and Hardware Maintenance and professional services.Net sales from Service Provider marginally improved to $473.6 million from $470 million reported in the prior-year period. Revenues fell short of our revenue estimate of $555 million. A decline in Hardware Maintenance and Professional services impacted sales growth in this segment. However, a moderate improvement in all customer solutions led to 1% year-over-year growth.Revenues from Enterprise registered a sharp 38% year-over-year increase to $645.5 million from $467.8 million. Net sales surpassed our revenue estimate of $526.3 million. Growth in all customer solutions boosted net sales from this segment.By customer solution, Automated WAN solutions’ revenues amounted to $474.6 million, up 3% year over year. Net sales from AI-Driven Enterprise were $371.1 million, up 63% year over year. Revenues from Cloud-Ready data centers remained relatively flat year over year at $200.3 million. Hardware Maintenance and Professional services contributed $384.1 million to revenues, up from $378.5 million reported in the year-ago quarter.By region, revenues from the Americas increased by 13% year over year to $848.6 million. Net sales from the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) rose to $354.6 million from $337.2 million in the prior-year quarter. The improvement in the EMEA and the Americas was driven by sequential growth in Enterprise and Cloud verticals.In the Asia-Pacific, revenues were up 23% year over year to $226.9 million with improvement in all verticals.Story continuesOther DetailsThe non-GAAP gross margin was 58.3% compared with 56.2% in the year-ago quarter. Higher net sales, declining logistics and supply-chain costs, combined with a favorable software mix and pricing actions, led to the year-over-year improvement.Non-GAAP operating expenses were $592 million, up from $537 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The increase is primarily due to higher headcount expenses. The non-GAAP operating margin rose to 16.9% compared with 13.9% in the year-earlier quarter.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityIn the second quarter of 2023, Juniper generated $343 million of cash from operating activities compared with $266.9 million in the prior-year period.As of Jun 30, 2023, the company had $1,089.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, with $1,602.6 million of long-term debt.OutlookFor the third quarter, Juniper expects that soft demand trends are likely to impact sales in the Cloud and Service provider verticals. Macroeconomic uncertainty is likely to affect consumer spending.For the third quarter, management estimates revenues of $1,385 million (+/- $50 million). The non-GAAP gross margin is approximated at 58.5% (+/- 1%). Juniper expects non-GAAP operating expenses to be $585 million (+/- $5 million). It anticipates the non-GAAP operating margin to be 16.3% at the midpoint of the revenue guidance.The non-GAAP tax rate is approximated at 19%. Assuming a share count of close to 328 million, the non-GAAP net income is estimated at 54 cents per share (plus or minus 5 cents).For 2023, the company lowered its expectation for revenue growth in the range of 5-6%, down from 9% expected earlier. It raised estimates for non-GAAP gross margin from approximately 58% to greater than 58% in 2023.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksJuniper currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Welcome to the Juniper Networks Q2 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert. You may begin.Jess Ian LubertThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release furnished with our 8-K filed today, the CFO commentary posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. (Operator Instructions) With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.Story continuesRami RahimGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q2 2023 results. We delivered better-than-expected results during the second quarter, with total revenue of $1.430 billion, growing 13% year-over-year and exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Product revenue grew by 15% year-over-year, and we saw year-over-year growth across all geographies. Profitability was also strong in Q2 as our non-GAAP gross and operating margin both exceeded expectations, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58, towards the high end of our quarterly guidance range. Our Q2 results reflect strong execution by our teams as well as the improvements we're seeing in the availability of supply. We remain confident in our positioning from a technology perspective and our ability to capitalize as our customers build their networks for the next decade, which we believe will leverage AI-powered software automation, an area where we have invested meaningfully over the last few years. We believe these investments, along with our go-to-market focus, will enable us to not only deliver sustained top line growth but also improved profitability even in a challenged end market environment. With respect to demand, total product orders grew nearly double digits on a sequential basis. And while the year-over-year rate of decline improved relative to last quarter, it was still meaningful due to the strong sequential performance in Q2 2022. While we are continuing to see positive momentum in our Enterprise business, we experienced weaker-than-expected trends with our cloud and service provider customers, which we believe is due to the timing of projects and the digestion of prior purchases. Despite these trends, we continue to expect the decline in orders to moderate further over the next few quarters and return to year-over-year growth potentially as soon as Q4 of this year. From a vertical perspective, I remain extremely encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in our Enterprise business, which delivered record revenue results and accounted for more than 45% of our total revenue, representing both our largest and fastest growing vertical for a third consecutive quarter. Not only did our Enterprise revenue grow by nearly 40% year-over-year in the Q2 time frame, our Enterprise product orders also saw healthy year-over-year growth despite a 20% plus comp in the year ago period. Importantly, new logos grew by more than 30% year-over-year, which we view as an important forward indicator given the opportunity to expand after landing many of these accounts. Not to be overlooked, deal registration through the channel and commercial orders both grew by more than 40% year-over-year, which we think speaks to the differentiation of our products and our ability to capture share. Within the Enterprise, our campus and branch business had another record quarter in Q2, with our AI-driven Enterprise revenue growing more than 60% year-over-year. Customers are recognizing Juniper's clear and defensible leadership when it comes to AI-driven operations delivered via a modern micro services cloud. While the rest of the industry continues to talk, we have real AI solutions that deliver real results, including a 90% reduction in worldwide trouble tickets at a global software company, 85% pure store visits by IT at a multinational retailer and the fastest branch network rollout in the history of a national mobile operator. Revenue from the Mistified segment of our business, which are products driven by Mist AI, had a record quarter, growing by nearly 100% year-over-year in the Q2 time frame, with orders growing by nearly 40% year-over-year. Strength was broad across the portfolio, with record wireless, wired and SD-WAN revenue in the quarter, as well as record full stack wins where customers purchased several of these campus and branch products together. We view momentum with these full stack wins as a positive forward-looking indicator, given our belief that for every dollar of wireless there is $2 to $3 of wired switching and additional SD-WAN opportunity. Marquee new AI-driven Enterprise customers this quarter include a Fortune 10 technology company, a Fortune 50 financial institution, an American supercenter chain, the U.K.'s largest cycling retailer and a multinational manufacturing company. We introduced several new innovations to the Juniper Mist portfolio this past quarter, including the industry's first AI-driven, cloud-based network access assurance solution, which we believe has the ability to revolutionize a very dated NAC industry. In addition, we expanded our AIOps leadership by integrating the Marvis virtual network assistant with Chat GPT for enhanced knowledge-based queries using large language models. And we integrated with a leading Internet collaboration platform for superior video performance. Our Enterprise data center business also performed well in Q2, with Apstra reporting a record quarter both from a revenue and an orders perspective. The Apstra pipeline continues to grow, with new logos more than doubling year-over-year for a second consecutive quarter. And we continue to see strong hardware pull-through for every dollar of software, which we view as a positive indicator for our Enterprise data center prospects. Our automation-driven data center revenue in the Enterprise posted a record quarter, primarily due to the increasing adoption of Apstra. New cloud-ready data center wins this quarter include a Fortune 250 financial services firm, a large U.S. restaurant chain and a large U.S. government agency. The performance of our Enterprise business shows our diversification strategy is working. And given our level of portfolio differentiation balanced against a relatively modest share in the large markets where we compete, I expect us to grow both our Enterprise revenue and orders during the year, even in a more challenged macro environment. As highlighted over the last few quarters, we continue to see accounts across each of our customer verticals more closely scrutinizing budgets and project deployment time lines due to the macro uncertainties that are happening around the world. This is proving to be particularly true in the cloud, where we're seeing more customers digesting prior purchases and pushing projects to future periods. While these dynamics are likely to pressure our cloud business for the next few quarters, we remain optimistic regarding our longer-term growth prospects in the cloud, given our strong wide area footprint, the rapid traffic growth that continues in many of these customer environments and the opportunity to capitalize on the adoption of large language models and the build-out of AI clusters. To this last point, we expect AI adoption to drive a meaningful uptick in traffic growth that is likely to benefit our cloud wide area footprint over time. However, we also see an attractive data center opportunity emerging where we believe the performance and power efficiency of our custom silicon, the congestion management capabilities embedded within our Junos operating system and our support for technologies such as RDMA networking will position us well to capture share, particularly with Cloud Majors accounts that are likely to bet on Ethernet as the protocol of choice to support their AI cluster investment. In fact, we've already begun to see successes in non-hyperscaler accounts. Our Service Provider business performed as expected in Q2, but moderated on both a sequential and year-over-year basis following the strong shipments we experienced in the Q1 time frame. We expect this business to remain lumpy going forward as the continued momentum we're seeing with respect to 400-gig deployments, particularly with some of our larger Tier 1 customers, is being offset by incremental weakness with Tier 2 and Tier 3 carriers that are being impacted by the softer macro environment. Despite these headwinds, we remain encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in our Cloud Metro portfolio, where our new ACX7000 platform experienced a record quarter, both from a revenue and an orders perspective, and the pipeline of opportunities remain strong. We expect this business to build through the remainder of the year and become more material to revenue in 2024 and beyond. In summary, I remain confident in our strategy and optimistic regarding our long-term growth prospects. My enthusiasm is fueled by our continued Enterprise momentum and the attractive longer-term opportunities we continue to see in the cloud as well as the SP Metro opportunity. However, given the digestion of prior purchases, and the uncertain timing of customer deployments, particularly amongst some of our larger cloud customers, we have less visibility, and our revenue results are likely to be pressured over the next few quarters. Based on these dynamics, we are reducing our full year revenue growth forecast. We remain committed to delivering improved profitability and still expect to deliver greater than 100 basis points of operating margin improvement in 2023. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.Kenneth Bradley MillerThank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our second quarter results, then provide some color on our outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2023 with $1.430 billion in revenue, above the midpoint of our guidance and up 13% year-over-year. We delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.58, towards the high end of our guidance range driven by higher-than-expected revenue and gross margin. From a customer solutions perspective, on a year-over-year basis, AI-driven Enterprise led the way with a revenue growth of 63%. Automated WAN solutions grew 3% and cloud-ready data center revenue was flat. Looking at our revenue by vertical, on a year-over-year basis, Enterprise increased 38%, Service Provider increased 1% and Cloud decreased 6%. Total software and related services revenue was $318 million, which was an increase of 49% year-over-year. ARR was $319 million and grew 37% year-over-year. We were pleased to see nearly 60% year-over-year growth in our SaaS and software license subscription portion of our deferred revenue. We remain confident in our outlook for total software and ARR growth. Total security revenue was $168 million, up 6% year-over-year due to the timing of shipments related to improved supply. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 6 were Cloud, 3 were Service Provider and 1 was in Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 27% of our total revenue as compared to 34% in the second quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP gross margin was 58.3%, which was above the midpoint of the guidance, primarily driven by favorable software revenue mix and higher revenue volume, partially offset by higher inventory-related expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 10% year-over-year, primarily due to headcount-related costs, but were flat sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin was 16.9% for the quarter, which was above our expectations, driven by higher revenue and better-than-expected gross margin. Cash flows from operations were $343 million, which was benefited by approximately $200 million in deferred federal tax payments that will be paid later in the year. We paid $70 million in dividends, reflecting our quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share. We also repurchased $120 million worth of shares in the quarter. We exited the second quarter of 2023 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.3 billion. Despite the challenging macro environment, our results for Q2 were very strong, and I'm pleased with our team's dedication and commitment. Now I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. For the third quarter, we expect to see continued weakness in orders, particularly with our Cloud and, to a lesser extent, our Service Provider customers. We believe the softness in orders is largely attributable to customer digestion of previously placed orders and certain projects being pushed to future periods. We expect the macro environment to remain challenged, which may continue to impact customer spending. These factors are negatively impacting our revenue expectations. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to modestly increase sequentially in the third quarter of 2023. This forecast assumes supply chain-related costs improved, but remain elevated relative to prepandemic levels. We will continue to manage non-GAAP operating expenses prudently and expect a sequential decline in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2023. Turning to our expectations for the rest of 2023. As mentioned previously, we experienced weaker-than-expected order activity in the second quarter, particularly with our Cloud and, to a lesser extent, our Service Provider customers. We expect this weakness to continue into the second half of the year. As such, we are amending our full year revenue guidance to approximately 5% to 6% growth. However, we are raising our non-GAAP gross margin guidance from approximately 58% to greater than 58% on a full year basis, primarily driven by anticipated improvements in supply chain costs. Additionally, we still expect to deliver non-GAAP operating margin expansion of greater than 100 basis points as the benefit from higher non-GAAP gross margin and prudent non-GAAP operating expense management should offset the impact of lower revenue. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to grow double digits in 2023. Our long-term financial objectives have not changed. We plan to deliver sustainable revenue growth, improved operating margin and earnings expansion over time. Finally, I am pleased to announce we have declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. In closing, I would like to thank the Juniper team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this dynamic environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.Simon Matthew LeopoldI wanted to discuss the weakness you called out on the Cloud orders. I'm wondering if you see this as an issue actually stemming from AI projects pulling budget from the areas where Juniper has its use cases. And if so, how do you think about really the timing and extent of the eventual knock-on effect, which you mentioned? So I understand AI could be a longer-term tailwind. I'm looking for a little bit more substance on that comment.Rami RahimYes. Thanks for the question, Simon. I think the biggest issue right now that we're facing in the Cloud provider segment is the period of digestion. It's not specific to any one customer. It's broad-based. It's not even just hyperscalers, it includes the Cloud Majors segment as well. To the question around AI, and it being a priority, I definitely see it. There is no doubt that our Cloud customers are focusing pretty intensely on artificial intelligence, making sure that they're equipped to deal with the additional services they're going to be offering and the demand that's going to place on their network. While in the short term that might have a bit of a negative impact, I think, to your point, and long term, it's actually quite attractive for us for 2 reasons. To the extent that AI is a new killer app that's going to be offered by cloud providers to their customers, it's going to result in an increase of traffic across the board in areas -- in the wide area where we have significant footprint and, of course, in the data center. And I do think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that it could offer a nice new opportunity for us to participate in, in the data center, with AI clusters being built increasingly over time with Ethernet as an alternative to what is today, the technology of choice, which is InfiniBand. The timing to your question is it's difficult to call right now, but it's really in several quarters.OperatorThe next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.Samik ChatterjeeI guess I wanted to get a sense, you're trimming your revenue guide for the full year today by about $150 million or so. I mean the incremental weakness that you're mentioning related to the last quarter is Service Provider, but if you can break down sort of how much of that revision on the guide is really coming from Cloud versus Service Providers. And maybe just in terms of thinking about sort of the reduction here, I think investors are going to question sort of the discussion around elevated backlog that most companies have discussed for a while, just given that even with the elevated backlog, the visibility into revenue remains pretty limited. So how are you guys thinking about sort of backlog in terms of what that backlog implies going forward, particularly given that some of the macro trends are still influencing revenue on a more real-time basis?Kenneth Bradley MillerSure. Thanks for the question. Yes. So for the guidance, the reduction in revenue expectation for the year is largely Cloud, right? I would say, to a lesser degree, Service Provider, but the vast majority of that reduction would be attributable directly to our Cloud business. On a year-to-date basis, our Cloud business is down 10%. I think it's likely that it ends the year down double digits. And this is really due to the weakness we saw in orders late in Q2 as well as what we expect to see for the rest of the year. So the vast majority of that is Cloud. I believe our Service Provider business will stay within kind of our guidance range of plus or minus 2%. So that's going to be largely intact with our long-term model. And Enterprise is clearly way ahead of our long-term model, and I expect it to remain way ahead as we exit the year. So the revenue decline is really mostly a Cloud phenomenon. From a backlog perspective, clearly, backlog is coming down as we expect it to this year. I'll tell you, it came down a little bit more than we expected, given that the order weakness that we called out in Q2. So backlog is coming down. However, it still remains about 3x what we would normally expect in kind of a pre-pandemic historical level. And I expect to exit the year, I still expect to remain elevated as we exit the year at approximately 2x kind of normal historical level. So it's coming down quickly, but it still remains quite elevated. It is going to put some pressure on 2024 revenue growth. The backlog is a tailwind in 2023. It will be a headwind to 2024 as the backlog -- we will not have as much elevated backlog entering next year as we did this year. It's going to require us to have a recovery in bookings and orders. The good news is I expect that we will have a recovery in orders. I expect next year to be a strong bookings year for all of our verticals as we kind of go through this backlog digestion period and react to the current lead time. So this year is obviously putting a lot of pressure on bookings. It's resulting in a declining backlog. I think next year would be a little more normal while bookings will drive revenue growth.OperatorUp next, we have Tim Long with Barclays.Timothy Patrick LongYes, I wanted to touch on the Enterprise business. Obviously, good numbers. There are still a lot of new customers. Could you talk a little bit about kind of where we're at with kind of win rates, deal sizes, kind of cross-selling? If you just give us a little more color on what's driving that. And related, if you can just touch on -- we're seeing macro impact a lot at other places. It looks like it's starting or going to start hit that Enterprise networking area soon. How do you view the success you've had and the market share gains in a backdrop where we might be seeing more pressure overall in the industry?Rami RahimOkay. Thanks for the question, Tim. Yes. So I'm obviously very pleased with the performance of our Enterprise business. And really, this is in the face of macro-related headwinds. Enterprise is now our largest, our fastest-growing segment in Q2 with over 45% of total revenue. The level of differentiation that we have in our Enterprise portfolio has never been stronger. You see it in the numbers. Our AI-driven Enterprise business grew at over 60%. Mistified revenue grew at over -- at approximately 100% year-over-year. And we also saw some really encouraging signs with Apstra in the data center, specifically again for the Enterprise. So the question around -- really, it's around durability: What happens if there were going to be sort of signs of weakness in the market? I'd just say that the Enterprise market, if it was -- it's -- there are headwinds in the market today. Absent those headwinds, we'd actually be doing even better. We'd be posting even better results than we have right now. And as just a point of consideration, take a look at how our Enterprise business performed even during the early days of the pandemic, where peers in the industry were not seeing growth, we were seeing growth, and that was through new logos, share taking, which is really happening right now. I'm very encouraged with the forward-looking metrics, things like 30% growth in new logos, deal registrations up 40%. This is really an indication of how much opportunity our channel partners are bringing to Juniper. Commercial business up at over 40%. This is -- these are signs, I believe, of success to come in the Enterprise. So for that reason, I'm encouraged by the business traction thus far, revenue growth and order growth this year. And it's, I think, fairly easy to call revenue growth for next year in the Enterprise.OperatorThe next question is from Alex Henderson with Needham.Alexander HendersonGreat. Couple of just mechanics issues. Can you talk a little bit about linearity in the quarter, pricing in the quarter, whether the pushouts were both in Cloud and in the Service Provider? And when you talk about the scale of the '24 headwinds, can you give us some sense of what the scale is on that? Is it a 2% headwind, 4%, 6%, more? And what's the split there between Enterprise, Service Provider and Cloud?Rami RahimMaybe I'll start with the 2024 view. And then, Ken, I'll let you comment a little bit more about linearity and pricing. And Alex, I appreciate the question. So it's a little too early to provide guidance on 2024 all up, especially given some of the digestion that we're seeing in the Cloud and, to a lesser extent, in the SP segment. However, I do think it is possible for us to grow revenue in 2024, and I'll just walk you through just some of the puts and takes to that. Backlog draw, as Ken just mentioned, in 2023, creates a pretty meaningful revenue headwind for us in 2024. So if you think about it, orders would need to accelerate from here to overcome the backlog-related headwind that this year is presenting to next year. Now the good news is we do expect orders to grow and, in fact, to accelerate for the full year in '24. And in fact, we see the order growth to happen across all customer segments, in Cloud, in SP and in Enterprise. In the Enterprise, as I just mentioned, which is the bulk of our business, it continues to do well today, both from an orders and revenue standpoint, it's very easy to call revenue growth for Enterprise next year. Cloud and SP, I'd just say it's a little bit too early for us to call right now. Orders will accelerate. We don't know if they're going to accelerate fast enough to overcome the backlog-related headwinds for next year. So the summary, I would say is, so while 2024 full year revenue growth is possible, it really is going to depend on the timing of order recovery for Cloud and SP. And I would say -- I'm sure Ken would say this if I don't, we're committed to both margin and EPS growth next year, in 2024, irrespective of what Cloud and SP does.Kenneth Bradley MillerYes. From a linearity perspective, I'm actually going to answer a couple of things. First, for the Q2 orders, the weakness in orders really showed up late in the quarter. So that was something that happened late in the quarter. And our current visibility is that the second half of the year is also going to be down as compared to our previous expectations in the Cloud and, to a lesser degree, Service Providers. So it really did kind of show up late in the quarter. I do want to touch on linearity for next year as well. I do believe it's going to be more of a back-end loaded year, a little bit different than, say, this year. So the first half of next year is going to be, I would say, particularly challenged from a growth opportunity perspective. And full year growth is too early to call. It is possible, but there's a lot of moving parts there. But I would set up a back-end loaded year, given the current situation we see and the weakness we see now is likely to bleed into the first half of next year. The other question you asked a little bit on, Alex, was pricing. We really didn't notice a material change in pricing activity. It's always been a very competitive pricing environment. It's kind of deal-to-deal, hand-to-hand combat in many ways. So really nothing to call out from a more holistic point of view on the pricing side.OperatorThe next question is from David Vogt with UBS.David VogtMaybe, Rami, can I just follow up on the Cloud digestion sort of train of thought here? And how are you thinking about where Juniper kind of fits in or slots in as either the hyperscalers or the major cloud providers really start to accelerate maybe CapEx next year in terms of where you slot in maybe from a timing perspective? And along those lines, are you seeing some of the order digestion or maybe pushouts being driven by maybe a reallocation of CapEx from Cloud customers, whether it's the hyperscalers or maybe cloud providers? Are they spending more on GPU-enabled servers and compute, and maybe that's putting pressure on other parts of network spend? And would just kind of get some thoughts and color on what you're hearing from your customers at this point.Rami RahimYes, I appreciate the question, David. I think the biggest factor right now that's impacting our Cloud business is digestion. It's just unprecedented order growth over the last couple of years, now being followed by a period where they need to work through the products that they've ordered, they need to receive them. They need to deploy them, and then revenue will catch up. Or orders will recover and revenue will catch up afterwards. As I mentioned earlier, there definitely is a lot of attention and maybe even some diversion of capital investments to AI clusters, GPUs, that sort of thing. And yes, I think that can have a short-term negative impact, not the biggest impact. Again, it's not as big, I would say, nor as near as big as -- that's just of digestion. But the long-term impact of that AI cluster investment, in my view, is a net positive. And this is true for areas of the Cloud provider network where we have significant market share in hyperscale WAN, for example, but it also presents opportunities for Juniper to participate in AI cluster Ethernet networking, which I believe becomes more dominant in time.OperatorNext, we have Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas.Karl AckermanI was hoping to tie in -- or I have a follow-up question with regard to some of the comments you answered -- or discussed earlier. One is I understand that pricing has not really changed yet. At the same time, you indicated that orders were toward the end of the quarter. So I guess are Service Provider and Cloud customers pushing back on price towards the end of the quarter? Is that some of the reason for your cautiousness? And then that's a clarification. I have a short question as well.Kenneth Bradley MillerYes. So just to clarify, I was mentioning that at the end of the quarter, orders, the weakness showed up late in the quarter. So actually, our orders were weaker at the end of the quarter than we would have expected as we started the quarter. So linearity was not back-end loaded. In fact, it didn't come in as strong as we thought it would over the last few weeks of the quarter from a bookings perspective.Karl AckermanI see. And I was hoping if you can just maybe address why hardware maintenance and professional services had moderated the last 2 quarters despite the improving strength in Enterprise? I suppose should we expect that to flip going forward?Kenneth Bradley MillerYes. So our hardware and maintenance business really is an installed base business. So although current period in revenue and recent period revenue obviously matters, it really is about the installed base. And we have seen significant strength in that business over the last several years, where it's been growing pretty routinely, maybe not as much as product when product is growing well, but it grows -- it still grows even when products has a down period. So it's a pretty stable business that's growing in line with our expectations, to be honest with you. There is a shift happening as well to more software. So when you isolate just hardware maintenance and support, you are kind of underestimating the true power of our services business, which is on the software side, which shows up in a different line item.OperatorUp next is George Notter with Jefferies.George Charles NotterIf I go back to last quarter, if I remember correctly, you guys were also pointing to Cloud customers going through a period of inventory digestion. And I guess it seems like it really intensified over the last 3 months. I guess my question for you is, is that the right observation? And do you get any commentary from them about why that's intensified? And then also, I just want to make sure this isn't a market share issue. Any sense for market share or your participation share-wise in some of these accounts?Rami RahimYes. So to answer the second part of the question first, no, I do not believe this is a market share issue. Just keep in mind that in hyperscale, our dominant footprint is in the wide area. So it is very much around sort of capital intensity, specifically for wide area investment, and so on. The first part of your question, the answer is yes. I mean it did intensify. We obviously had some expectation of how long the period of digestion would take, how long it would take to deploy new projects and has it elongated. Having said that, it's important to say that projects that we have been working on, and competing for, remain intact. We have not seen Cloud providers cancel projects. 400-gig deployments in the wide area, for example, remain incredibly important, especially with cloud providers having to invest in new AI capabilities. Ultimately, that's going to generate more demand, traffic growth on their network across every use case. And the projects that were in place might have moved out in time, but they have not been eliminated. And it continues to be an intense area of focus for us at Juniper.George Charles NotterGot it. And then just a quick follow-on. I know you guys are working on new silicon for the PTX. I'm just curious about where that is. That's obviously, I think, an important new product delivery for Cloud customers. Just wondering where that is.Rami RahimYes. So I mean it's looking great, honestly. I mean the level of innovation and just the sophistication of the silicon technology that we've developed, and the latest Express silicon looks just absolutely remarkable. Customers that have had an early view of what we've developed are incredibly excited about it. I believe from a market fit standpoint, it absolutely is addressing some of these big cloud provider use cases that I just discussed, and we're getting close. So stay tuned.OperatorNext question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs.Michael NgI just had some follow-ups to your comments on Samik's question on backlog. So you started the year with over $2 billion in the backlog. Are you still expecting to exit the year with backlog levels around $500 million to $1 billion? Any comments on where those net backlog reduction sat in 2023 by customer vertical? And then I just have a quick follow-up.Kenneth Bradley MillerYes. So we still expect to exit the year on an elevated level, about 2x normal. And we define normal historically as we were $400 million plus or minus a bit for quite a period of time. So I'm talking about maybe the middle to the high end of that $500 million to $1 billion range that you talked about. $800 million, plus or minus $100 million or $200 million, would be where I'd expect our backlog to exit for the end of the year. So still elevated. To date, it's been coming down fairly proportionately across all verticals. We entered the year with a pretty balanced backlog as compared to what our revenue is. That said, I think we'll exit the year with a little bit more in the Enterprise side, and we'll probably burn through the Cloud backlog at a little faster rate than the other verticals, given some of the weakness that we've mentioned on the new orders.Michael NgGreat. That's really helpful. And just a housekeeping question. Orders being up nearly double digits sequentially, my model kind of suggests that implies down mid-20s on a year-over-year basis. Is that kind of in the ballpark?Kenneth Bradley MillerYes, we did see a modest improvement from last quarter on a year-over-year basis, and we expect modest -- we expect improvement going forward. And we could return to growth as soon as Q4. So yes, we are -- we did see some modest improvement. So that's in line, I think, with kind of where you are.OperatorThe next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.Meta A. MarshallGreat. I noted that you guys were saying that there was some elongation with maybe Tier 2 and Tier 3 Service Providers and Cloud. Those have been areas where you would had a lot of new customer wins in the last year. And so I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of, is this some of the new wins that you had over the last year just taking longer to implement? Or is it kind of broader across all of the customers within that area? And then the second question is just if you could give a sense of kind of what the overhang on gross margins is still from kind of expedite fees or kind of supply chain costs?Rami RahimOkay. Thanks, Meta. So the period of elongation has been mostly a Cloud, to a lesser extent, in SP. You are right, we have won, we've secured new projects over the last year or 2 that we have mentioned on these earnings calls. And even there, where we have started deployments, some of the deployments have just moved out in time. So it applies to areas where we have existing footprint and net new wins where we've started to see some benefit, but maybe not as much benefit as we would have otherwise enjoyed had this elongation not taken place. And again, it's mostly a Cloud phenomenon to a lesser extent, in the SP. And then the second part of the question, I'll leave it to Ken on the gross margin.Kenneth Bradley MillerYes. On the gross margin side, we are starting to see some recovery in those costs. I would point to logistics, in particular, that we're seeing some recovery there as well as some of the expedite fees. I still think there's 70 basis points, maybe a little more, maybe a little less, impact to supply constraint costs. So there's still opportunity for it to get better. The other thing I would add is we did call out -- I called out in my prepared remarks, we are seeing some higher inventory-related expenses that were in Q2, and I expect some of those to persist into the second half. But that's been factored into the guidance that we provided on gross margin.OperatorThe next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.Atif MalikGood to see orders growing double digits sequentially. I have a question for Ken. I apologize, I'm a bit new to covering Juniper. Ken, why provide a full year outlook given Cloud and Service weakness? Is this because of supply chain tightness that you guys saw during COVID, which stretched your lead times? I'm just trying to understand the rationale behind providing the outlook for this year and even commentary into next year.Kenneth Bradley MillerYes. So the commentary to next year, just to be clear, we are not providing an outlook for 2024. We're trying to provide you with the puts and takes, right? And we do think Enterprise, that is the one outlook we did provide. We do expect to grow Enterprise next year given the strength of our products and the differentiation we enjoy there. But Cloud and SP, way too early to call, therefore, too early to call the aggregate number. For this year, the rest of it really is just about Q3, what we're providing guidance for, and really Q4. And we did provide a range, 5% to 6%, for the full year. I do think that's -- based on current visibility, we feel comfortable with that guidance. We still have the elevated backlog that I mentioned earlier. That really does drive a good chunk of the revenue that we're going to recognize for the rest of the year. So it's just really the visibility we have now, we felt comfortable with that type of a range given where we are in the year.OperatorThe next question is from James Fish with Piper Sandler.James Edward FishLook, I know you guys are highlighting digestion and also highlighted Ethernet as the kind of the main protocol over InfiniBand. But Rami, for you, just any updated view why Ethernet will be best for AI workloads? And secondly, given the increased networking demands with AI, is this part of the reason for the optimism for orders to reaccelerate in 2024? And if so, why do you think Juniper's portfolio is best positioned to handle those AI workloads?Rami RahimOkay. So the optimism, I would say, is not just rooted in Ethernet being sort of the technology of choice for AI clusters, that's a component of it. But the optimism really is around the fact that traffic growth in Cloud providers continues to grow. Digestion can't happen forever. Eventually, they're going to deplete through their inventory and they're going to -- and Cloud providers are going to need to invest in their networks. To the extent that they invest in the wide area, we will benefit from that just based on our footprint. And then in the data center, as you know, we've got a very good footprint in the top 10 and in the broader Cloud Majors. And I would add to that, and it's an addition, that AI clusters moving to Ethernet would present a net new opportunity for us. And to your question about why Ethernet and not InfiniBand, I mean, obviously, today, most AI clusters are built with InfiniBand. In the future, however, Ethernet present -- has some distinct advantages. From an economic standpoint, it's got a broader ecosystem. So it's not just Juniper. There will be a number of players. They're going to be innovating in the Ethernet space to capture the requirement of AI clusters. That means from an economic standpoint, customers that want to deploy large language model-type clusters are going to benefit economically from moving to Ethernet. But I want to just highlight that this does not happen overnight. This is going to be something that will take several quarters, likely over a year or so, in order for Ethernet to start having a meaningful volume of business tied to AI cluster networking.James Edward FishHelpful. And if I could just follow up there on your comments. Any sense as to how much excess inventory the Cloud and Service Providers are holding versus normal? Is it more the inventory issue is on the Cloud side with kind of the deployment issue on the Service Provider side? Or is it kind of the same pane across both?Rami RahimWell, it's mostly a cloud provider thing. It's to a lesser extent in the service provider space Obviously, they're sitting on elevated inventory. When we talk about digestion, really, it means that they are drawing down that inventory and deploying it into their networks. I think your question is really getting to the timing. And we don't know with certainty at this point in time. I can tell you there's going to be several quarters before -- as they draw down inventory, do that deployment and they start to see the acceleration -- and we start to see the acceleration of orders again.OperatorThe next question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America.Tal LianiYes. Sorry to ask a third question on the same topic. I just wanted to get the numbers right. Last quarter, you said that backlog was roughly $1.7 billion and the drawdown was about $350 million. This time -- and in the past, you said that the normal backlog is $300 million to $400 million. So this time, you're saying 3x the backlog. So if I take the $400 million, the high end, it's $1.2 billion, and it means that the backlog drawdown went up from $350 million to $500 million sequentially. But then you're saying that by the end of the year, it will be $800 million to $1 billion. So that means that the -- you expect the backlog drawdown to slow down materially in the next 2 quarters. I just want to make sure that the numbers that we have are correct. Or if you can give us -- be a little bit more specific with that because I'm sure everyone is doing the same math to understand the backlog drawdown.Kenneth Bradley MillerYes. Let me add some specificity to the backlog. So we have talked about we ended the last quarter, Q2, at approximately 3x number of levels. We're between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, right? That would be our current backlog position, between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion. And I do still expect to exit the year at approximately 2x. I'm using $400 million as my average. So that means approximately $800 million. So currently, $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, expect to exit the year at approximately $800 million. That does presume a bit of a slowdown in the second half as compared to the first half. But that's obviously based on our expectations of shipments and bookings for the rest of the year.Tal LianiGot it. on the same topic, but differently, if the weakness is coming -- the order weakness is coming mainly from Cloud and a little bit less than in Service Providers, and on the other hand your Enterprise is very strong, so does it mean that the backlog drawdown is much more meaningful as a percentage of your revenues in these verticals? So I'm just trying to understand if we should assume that the backlog drawdown is mostly tilted towards the Service Providers and Cloud and less to the Enterprise given the difference in the revenue performance.Kenneth Bradley MillerYes. So I do expect this year, we'll exit with elevated -- I think the proportion will be more Enterprise versus how we entered the year, which was more proportional to our revenue. That said, our revenue is also starting to [slant] much more towards enterprise as well. So that backlog is getting the bookings growth. So the decline in that backlog is less than the other verticals, which are actually declining on a year-over-year basis. From a bookings perspective, revenue is holding up a little bit better, particularly Service Provider revenue, which is up on a first half basis. So yes, we are burning a little bit more in those 2 verticals as compared to our Enterprise vertical.OperatorWe have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

Reported EPS is $1.01, expectations were $0.97.Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Comcast's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.Marci Ryvicker: Thank you, operator, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. You'll first hear from Mike Cavanagh and Jason Armstrong. Then Brian Roberts and Dave Watson will join us and be available for Q&amp;A. I will now refer you to slide two of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations Web site, which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer. This conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.Michael Cavanagh: Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our second quarter results, which again demonstrate that our focused efforts to invest and innovate in businesses that offer significant revenue growth, while we carefully manage the contiguous areas with structurally lower growth is paying off. Total revenue grew 2%, and the sixth growth priority areas we have outlined: residential broadband, wireless, business services, theme parks, streaming and premium content creation in our studios, grew nearly 10% year-over-year, and now represent 55% of total revenue. This revenue growth combined with careful management of margins across all businesses generated mid single-digit EBITDA growth and double-digit earnings per share growth.Story continuesLooking farther into the future, we expect to continue to drive significant growth in these areas, and to continue to identify and invest in organic growth opportunities across our strong portfolio of businesses. We are also very clear-eyed about the challenges that we and our competitors face in other business lines, and have established thoughtful plans which will enable these businesses to continue to meaningfully contribute both financially and strategically. Importantly, the net effect of this approach is a path to sustained future revenue growth for the company in total, driving strong earnings and free cash flow growth for, what I expect to be, many years to come. Significantly, we have by far the strongest balance sheet among our core competitors, which allows us to continue to invest for growth while returning substantial capital to shareholders through both dividends and buybacks which will drive excellent free cash flow and earnings per share growth.Now, let me call out a few highlights from the quarter. For the first time in the company's history, we generated over $10 billion in quarterly EBITDA. And while the diversification of our businesses means there were several significant contributors, I would highlight three that stand out to me in the quarter and reflect the consistency of our investments and the resulting durability of our growth profile. The first is broadband ARPU growth of 4.5%. Stepping back, I am confident we have a winning hand in convergence. We are the largest broadband provider with a high-quality ubiquitous network, and the most cost-efficient upgrade path to higher speeds. In addition, we can compete effectively in wireless with a capital-light approach, and a very strong value proposition for our customers.We also have a long history of consistently surrounding our products with industry-leading features and capabilities, ranging from the coverage and control aspects of our WiFi experience, to content aggregation through our X1 and Flex platforms, which is how we have been able to achieve near-record low levels of churn and grow ARPU consistently quarter after quarter. This second quarter's 4.5% growth was no exception, and is a testament to our ability to appropriately balance rate and volume to effectively segment the market and surround our broadband product with industry-leading products and capabilities. The broadband market remains highly competitive, but we have and will continue to invest to sustain our position as a market leader. Second is our parks, which continues to be such a great story for us.Our teams have consistently introduced new and innovative attractions, leveraging both our owned or licensed IP. We opened Super Nintendo World at both Universal Hollywood and Japan, which helped drive the record results in the quarter. Later this summer, we will be opening a new Minion Land in Orlando, and we look forward to Donkey Kong, in Japan, next year, as well as starting the previously announced kid's theme park, in Texas, and the Halloween Horror experience, in Las Vegas. And I couldn't be more excited about the opening of Epic Universe, in Orlando, in 2025. Third is the strength of our film studios and in particular our animation business. Super Mario Bros. crossed over $1.3 billion in worldwide box office to date, making it the second-highest grossing animated film ever.This is another incredible achievement by Illumination and Chris Meledandri. We also invest in successful franchises like Fast, highlighted by the successful launch of the latest installment with Fast X during the quarter. Of course, we just released Oppenheimer, which gross about $180 million this past weekend to tremendous acclaim from critics and moviegoers alike. Oppenheimer is such a powerful and impactful movie, and we at Comcast couldn't be proud to work with Christopher Nolan to bring such an important movie to audiences globally. We have the very best roster of creative partners, and these innovative filmmakers enable us to invest in a strategic slate, which is one of the keys to our continued box office success where we remain number two in box office year-to-date.All of these results and accomplishments, from broadband differentiation, to studio leadership, to our park success are a function of our focused leadership team, commitment to innovation, strong balance sheet, and disciplined approach to capital allocation. As I look at our company, I am extremely bullish on the durability of growth drivers we have invested in so consistently, and in our continued ability to invest and deliver through a variety of businesses and economic cycles. This was also my first quarter with direct responsibility for NBCUniversal. And I observed in a note announcing some organizational changes a few weeks ago, NBCU is a very special place with tremendous opportunities ahead. I could not be more impressed with the depth of talent, and particularly with our leadership team.And I am very confident that the new streamlined organization we have just put in place, and which has been very well received will help us move even faster and make even better decisions. As you know, NBCU operates a diverse array of businesses, each with leading market positions. In addition to film and parks, which I referenced earlier, we have the number one TV portfolio by total audience, and our TV studio is award-winning and prolific. We're the number one most watched news organization in the U.S., and sports continues to be a huge driver, with the NFL, NASCAR, gold, Premier League, the World Cup on Telemundo, including the Women's World Cup going on right now, Big Ten starting this fall, and the Paris Olympics coming up next year. I am also confident that we have the right strategy for the future.We produce premium content through our studios, distributed through our TV networks, Peacock and third parties, and further monetize this content with our theme parks and consumer products. In streaming, we launched Peacock as an ad-supported model that is an extension of our existing business. We set out a plan, which we have adapted as needed, and Peacock is strong and growing. We gained two million paid subscribers in the second quarter, going from 22 million to 24 million paid subscribers. This growth was largely driven by conversion of Comcast subs to paying relationships which started in June. And we're very pleased with the results so far. Without a doubt, consumer trends such as cord-cutting and new competitors, particularly from the technology sector present challenges for us.And we are facing an uncertain macro environment which continues to pressure linear advertising. But I firmly believe that we have the business strategy, management dept, and financial strength to emerge as long-term winners and value creators as the landscape evolves at NBCUniversal, and across the company. Another challenge in the near-term are the writers and actors strikes. We remain committed to reaching a fair deal as soon as possible so we can get back to doing what we do best, which is making great content together. With that, let me turn it over to Jason.provider, network, datacenter, parallel, net, hardware, business, server, new, internet, tech, hub, broadband, cable, data, cords, port, socket, digital, adapter, rack,EvgeniiAnd/Shutterstock.comJason Armstrong: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We had a really strong second quarter. And to take you through it, I'll start with our consolidated results on slide four. Revenue increased 2% to $30.5 billion, while adjusted EBITDA grew 4% to $10.2 billion, a record level driven by continued operating leverage at our high-margin Connectivity &amp; Platforms business, as well as strong growth at Studios and Theme Parks. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 12% to $1.13, and generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow, while returning $3.2 billion of capital to shareholders. Our healthy level of free cash flow in the quarter includes the significant investments we're making to support and grow our businesses in six key growth areas; our connectivity businesses including Residential Broadband, Wireless, and Business Services Connectivity, Theme Parks, Streaming, and premium content in our studios.Taken together, these areas generated more than half of our total company revenue in the quarter, and grew nearly 10% year-over-year, consistent with the first quarter. Now, let's turn to our individual business results, starting on slide five, with Connectivity &amp; Platforms. As I get into these results, I'll refer to year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue for total Connectivity &amp; Platforms was flat at $20.4 billion. Our core connectivity businesses, domestic broadband, domestic wireless, international connectivity, and Business Services Connectivity increased 7% to over $10 billion in revenue, while video, advertising, and other revenue declined 7% to $9.8 billion. Our strategy continues to incorporate a strong focus on investing in and driving growth in high-margin businesses while protecting profitability in businesses with secular headwinds through disciplined cost management.This resulted in 170 basis points of margin expansion for Connectivity &amp; Platforms in the second quarter, while margins for our domestic legacy cable business improved 240 basis points, reaching a record high of 47.3%. Diving deeper into the details, first, I'll unpack connectivity revenue growth. Residential Connectivity revenue grew by 8%, reflecting 4% growth in domestic broadband, 20% growth in wireless, and 26% growth in international, while revenue for Business Services Connectivity grew 4%. Domestic broadband continued to be led by very strong ARPU growth, which increased 4.5% for the second consecutive quarter. As we have said before, our goal is to protect ARPU by retaining the appropriate balance between rate and volume, and to serve our customers' constant demand for more from our network.We continue to see the use cases for better and faster Internet increase. Demand for higher speeds is increasing, as is average network consumption, and our customers are hanging more devices off our network in their homes. The average monthly data usage for a broadband customer that doesn't take video from us is nearly 700 gigabytes, and continues to grow. In fact, this is nearly 70% more than the average usage from the comparable quarter in 2019, pre-pandemic. Additionally, nearly three quarters of our broadband customers are now in speed plans of 400 megs and above. That's up from less than 50% last year and less than 20% in 2020. We plan for our network and product capabilities to stay far ahead of demand, so that we maintain our position as the market leader, delivering the best broadband possible.To that end, our transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is progressing well. We are more than halfway through the year, and have implemented on mid-split technology at 25% of our footprint, and are on target to complete one-third of this build by year-end, with the first commercial launch of DOCSIS 4.0 in just a few short months. We are also hard at work when it comes to expanding our footprint. We've grown our homes and businesses past by 1.5% year-over-year to 61.8 million, and we are on pace to meet or exceed our goal of 1 million new homes and businesses past for 2023, with future footprint expansion remaining a high priority. Growth in domestic wireless revenue was due to higher service revenue, driven by continued strong momentum in customer lines, which were up $1.4 million or 30% year-over-year, to $6 million in total, including the 316,000 lines we just added in the quarter.This marked the seventh consecutive quarter of more than 300,000 line additions. We continue testing some new converged offers in the quarter, and we are encouraged by an increasing mix of new customers to Comcast. And we will continue to experiment with different offers over time. With just 10% of our domestic residential broadband customers taking our mobile offering, we have a big opportunity and long runway ahead for growth in wireless. International connectivity revenue grew to $1 billion, a record high, and demonstrates the strength of the Sky brand and the ability to leverage a leadership position in video, and extend that to connectivity with significant success. Broadband, which accounts for two-thirds of international connectivity revenue continue to grow at a mid-teens level, benefiting from both an increase in customers and ARPU, compared to a year ago.The remainder is wireless revenue, which tends to have more variable growth due to handsets, which contributed to the higher growth this quarter. Finally, on Business Services Connectivity, revenue increased 4%, reflecting stronger growth in enterprise and mid-market and a slight deceleration in growth from small business, where we are seeing a bit of macro economic pressure. The strong revenue growth overall in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video, due to customer losses since last year, as well as declines in other revenue, reflecting similar dynamics in wireline voice. And finally, in advertising, which was impacted by lower political revenue in our domestic markets and the macro environment. Connectivity in platforms total EBITDA increased 4% to $8.3 billion, and as I mentioned a moment ago, adjusted margin that expanded 170 basis points.This is driven by the mix shift to our high margin connectivity businesses coupled with very strong expense management. In fact every line of expense was down year-over-year, except direct product costs, which are success-based and directly associated with the significant growth in our connectivity businesses. Further on tacking our connectivity and platform's EBITDA results between residential and business, residential EBITDA grew 4% with margin improving 180 basis points to reach 38.9%, again, highlighting our favorable mix shift, while business EBITDA grew 5% with margin improving 40 basis points to reach 57.7%. Now, let's turn to Content &amp; Experiences on slide six. Content &amp; Experiences revenue increased 4% to $10.9 billion, and EBITDA increased 7.5% to $2.2 billion, driven by record results at parks and strong growth at studios, fueled by the success of Super Mario Brothers.Taking a closer look at the results, our media segment combines our TV networks and Peacock, matching our holistic approach to managing these businesses. As viewership shifts to streaming, our dual revenue strategy at Peacock, where we are growing advertising and distribution revenue, is offsetting declines in linear revenue. At the same time, we are managing costs at our linear networks, and reallocating some of these resources to Peacock, with the goal of maximizing profitability over the long-term across our media portfolio. You see that in our media results this quarter was stable revenue, a strong growth in Peacock offset the performance at our linear networks. Immediate EBITDA decreased 18%, which included a $651 million EBITDA loss at Peacock.To get a little further into details, domestic advertising declined 5% with underlying trends consistent to prior quarters, reflecting continued softness in the overall market, partially offset by strong growth in advertising at Peacock, which increased over 75% driven by strong demand. We expect these overall results in advertising to continue in the third quarter. Domestic distribution increased 2% driven by Peacock distribution revenue growth of nearly 70%. Peacock paid scribers landed at $24 million compared to $30 million a year ago and $22 million at the end of the first quarter. As Mike mentioned, in June we began an effort to transition Comcast bundle scribers who received Peacock for free to a paid relationship. We've made some nice progress to date as the conversion activity drove Peacock second quarter subscriber growth.And we are bullish on further increasing our Peacock subscriber base through the balance of 2023, driven by both our continued conversion efforts as well as strong programming in the second-half. Some highlights included strong line up of movies exclusively on Peacock in our Pay-One window including Super Mario Bros. coming August 3rd; a day &amp; date movie, Blumhouse, Five Nights at Freddy's coming at the end of October. And continued benefit from our next day broadcast Bravo content along with a strong sports lineup including Sunday Night Football, and for the first time, Big Ten. Turning to Studios, we had a great quarter driven by our film business including the latest installment of the Fast franchise and a tremendous success of Super Mario Bros.While theatrical revenue growth was offset by lower content licensing at our television studios due the timing of when we deliver content, the momentum in our film business led by the success of Mario fueled nearly $260 million in year-over-year growth in studio EBITDA. At Theme Parks, revenue increased 22% and EBITDA increased 32% to $833 million, a record level. Our park in Hollywood continued momentum from opening Super Nintendo World last quarter. The positive consumer reaction drove strong attendance and per cap growth, helping Hollywood to deliver its best quarter EBITDA in its history. Our international parks are both experiencing nice rebound post COVID. Our park in Osaka delivered a record level of EBITDA for a second quarter as it continues to benefit from strong demand from Super Nintendo World.And our park in Beijing enjoyed its most profitable quarter to date, resulting in strong improvement compared to last year when the park was largely closed due to COVID. In Orlando, our comparisons were impacted by unprecedented levels of visitation last year. But underlying momentum remains healthy as attendance was relatively in line with 2019 pre-pandemic levels while revenue was substantially ahead of 2019 levels. I'll now wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 7. As I mentioned previously, we generated $3.4 billion in free cash flow this quarter, and achieved this while absorbing meaningful investments in our network and theme parks. These investments drove a 20% increase in total capital spending, primarily driven by higher CapEx which was consistent with the outlook that we provided on our last quarter call.At Connectivity &amp; Platforms, CapEx increased to 11% with CapEx intensity coming in at 10.4%, primarily driven by investments to accelerate our home passed as well as transition our U.S. network to DOCSIS 4.0. Content &amp; Experiences CapEx increased by $344 million, driven by parks, with Epic accounting for the majority of this quarter's increase in spend. Turning to return on capital and our balance sheet, we repurchased $2 billion worth of shares in the quarter. In addition, dividend payments totaled $1.2 billion for a total return on capital in the second quarter of $3.2 billion. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 2.4 times, in line with our target leverage. With that, let me turn it over to Brian for a few words before we turn the call back to Marci.Brian Roberts: Thanks, Jason. I am really pleased with our team and this outstanding performance for the first-half of the year. It was a terrific quarter on all the great metrics you've just articulated. So, I would like to just zoom out a bit. And probably what's most exciting is the hopefully recurring and sustainable model that we are able to leverage our faster growing businesses which you laid out to generate revenue growth for the entire company. And then, we convert that all the way free cash flow per share that accelerates with the strength of our company and our balance sheet. I really couldn't be more proud of the team, excited about the future. So, Marci, let's turn it over to you for Q&amp;A.Marci Ryvicker: Thanks, Brian.

238,648fa314-4faf-3db8-b051-3881fa53981c,URI,2023-07-29,3 Under-the-Radar Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in August,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-under-radar-large-cap-210700658.html,1690578420,STORY,"['PAYX', 'TXT', 'URI']","[Stocks surged higher on Friday. The positivity came after the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge showcased cooling prices and hit its lowest level in nearly two years.Jay Powell didn’t declare victory over inflation when the Fed raised rates by 0.25% on Wednesday. But he certainly wasn’t hawkish either. Wall Street is growing increasingly confident that the Fed is all but done hiking. On top of that, the earnings picture is holding up very well as we get deeper into the heart of Q2 earnings season.  With this in mind, we dive into three somewhat under-the-radar large-cap stocks that all reported upbeat quarterly results already that investors might want to buy as we head into August.Paychex (PAYX)Paychex is a software company focused on payroll and other HR-centric offerings such as benefit management, insurance, and beyond. Paychex’s growing suite of HR-based software and technology has helped it amass roughly 740k customers across the U.S. and Europe. The firm is not a household name like Salesforce and some other business software companies. Yet Paychex boasts that its software helps pay one out of every 12 private sector employees in the U.S.Paychex has grown its revenue and earnings at steady clips over the last decade, including 14% top-line expansion in its fiscal 2022 and 9% in FY23—period ended on May 31, 2023—to reach $5 billion for the first time. Looking ahead, PAYX’s revenue is projected to pop 7% in FY24 and another 5% in FY25 to reach $5.62 billion. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are expected to climb by 10% in FY24 and 7% higher in its fiscal 2024, which comes on top of 13% EPS growth last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPaychex’s earnings revisions have continued to climb over the last several years and its more recent upbeat EPS trends help it grab a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. The company boosted its dividend payout by 13% earlier this year, with a yield of 2.8% right now. It is worth stressing as well that digital payroll services and more are nearly ubiquitous and never going out of style.Story continuesPaychex stock has climbed 210% in the last decade to top the S&amp;P 500 and its industry, which are both up around 180%. PAYX shares have surged 72% in the past three years, but are down around 1% in the past 12 months vs. the benchmark’s 10% climb. That said, the stock has ripped 16% higher since its Q4 FY23 report on June 29.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite the rebound, Paychex trades 9% below its record highs. Plus, PAYX climbed back above its 50-week moving average in early July and it is now above its 50-day and 200-day, with it prepared to complete the golden cross, where the shorter-dated trendline climbs back above the longer-term trend. Paychex is also trading at a 25% discount to its highs at 26.9X forward earnings and right near its own decade-long median.Textron (TXT)Textron operates in the broader Aerospace – Defense segment with a wide-range of offerings in the field, as well as far more commercial segments. TXT’s various units and brands include Bell, Cessna, Beechcraft, Pipistrel, Arctic Cat, and more. For instance, Arctic Cat is a leader in the snowmobile and the small off-road vehicle space such as ATVs and side-by-sides. Textron’s Cessna unit is a major player in the world of private aviation for business travel and other, mostly non-commercial flight.Textron’s Pipistrel segment is attempting to push the boundaries of electric aircrafts. TXT’s portfolio also includes Bell, which landed a potentially huge contract with the U.S. Army in late 2022. Textron’s next-generation helicopters are set to become the U.S. Army’s new long-range assault aircraft. The contract could be worth up to $80 billion based on multiple reports.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTextron, which currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), on July 27 posted an impressive beat-and-raise quarter. TXT topped our Q2 EPS estimate by 22%, with its adjusted earnings up 32% YoY. The company also boosted its bottom-line outlook to between $5.20 - $5.30 a share vs. our current $5.09 consensus, which would already mark 27% growth. Zacks estimates call for another solid year of bottom-line expansion in FY24 and strong revenue expansion. And expect analysts to raise these outlooks in the coming days and weeks following TXT’s Q2 report.Textron earlier this month said it approved a new stock buyback program. And six of the 11 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys,” next to five “Holds.” TXT stock is up 165% in the last 10 years to blow away its Aerospace – Defense industry’s 29%. This run includes a 121% surge in the last 36 months. TXT stock has, however, chopped around rather heavily over the last two years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTextron is now up 8% YTD, after it soared following its blowout Q2 results and guidance. TXT is attempting to hit new highs and break out of its current range. TXT is now back above its 50-week moving average and it soared above its 200-day. TXT currently trades below its average Zacks price target. Some investors might appreciate that it sits at around $76 per share, while Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman both trade for around $450 per share.Despite its long-term outperformance of the Aerospace – Defense industry, Textron trades at a roughly 40% discount at 14.4X forward 12-month earnings. TXT’s current valuation also represents 9% value vs. its own decade-long median and 32% compared to its own highs.United Rentals (URI) United Rentals is one of the world’s largest equipment rental firms. URI’s portfolio allows its customers, which include construction firms, utility companies, and far beyond, to rent scissor lifts, towable light towers, generators, and nearly everything else under the sun. The firm’s revenue was booming prior to Covid, with sales up between 15% to 21% for three straight years until they slipped in 2020. But URI quickly left its setbacks behind and posted 14% sales growth in FY21 and 20% in 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnited Rentals has been able to lift its prices alongside inflation, while benefiting from its Ahern Rentals acquisition in late 2022. United Rentals carried over its momentum into 2023, and it topped our Q2 earnings and revenue estimates on July 26. URI, which grabs a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now, also boosted its FY23 outlook. CEO Matthew Flannery said in prepared remarks that it remains “encouraged by the momentum we are carrying into the busiest part of our season as well as our customers’ continued optimism.” Current Zacks estimates call for URI’s sales to jump 20% in 2023 and another 4% in 2024. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to surge by 22% and 9%, respectively. And expect these projections to improve as more analysts update their outlooks. United Rentals aims to keep capitalizing on multi-year tailwinds across infrastructure, manufacturing, and energy and power.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchURI has surged 650% in the past 10 years to crush the S&amp;P 500’s 180% and the Zacks construction sector’s 160%. United Rentals is up 37% in the last 12 months, with it hovering around 8% below its all-time highs. The stock found support at its 50-week moving back in May, and its recent run has it trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. And URI is trading at a 40% discount to its own decade-long highs and right at its median of 10.6X forward 12-month earnings.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

244,afcdfb9a-cae6-3699-a973-8b463bc67e21,FIS,2023-07-29,What's in the Cards for Fidelity National (FIS) in Q2 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-cards-fidelity-national-fis-173300322.html,1690565580,STORY,"['FIS', 'BAH']","[Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. FIS is slated to report second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 2, before the opening bell.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fidelity National’s second-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $1.48, which indicates a decline of 14.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus mark for revenues stands at $3.7 billion, suggesting a 0.5% fall from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Earnings Surprise HistoryFidelity National has a decent earnings surprise history. Its bottom line beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average surprise being 2.3%. This is depicted in the chart below:Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseFidelity National Information Services, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseFidelity National Information Services, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. QuoteWhat Our Quantitative Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Fidelity National this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is the case here.Earnings ESP: Fidelity National has an Earnings ESP of +0.05% because the Most Accurate Estimate of $1.48 aligns with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: FIS carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Factors to NoteGrowing contributions from its Banking Solutions and Capital Markets segments are expected to have fueled FIS’s top-line growth. Elevated transaction and account growth due to volatility in the banking sector are likely to have driven recurring revenue growth in the Banking segment. The company estimates organic growth to be in the range of 0-2% for the segment. We expect Banking Solution’s second-quarter revenues to grow 0.1% year over year to $1.7 billion.Story continuesIn the second quarter, the Capital Market Solutions unit of Fidelity National is expected to have benefited on the back of growing sales volume and transition to SaaS-based engagements. The company estimates organic growth to be in the range of 4-6% for the unit. We expect Capital Market’s second-quarter revenues to grow 3.8% year over year to $655.9 million.Lower-margin revenue mix and cost inflation might have acted as a common drag on the segments’ quarterly performance. Moreover, the negative macroeconomic impact is likely to have affected Merchant Solution’s performance in the second quarter. We expect Merchant Solutions’ revenues to decline 0.9% year over year to $1.3 billion.Prudent investments in innovative technologies and an enhanced digital solutions suite are likely to have boosted operational efficiencies and expanded the customer base for Fidelity National in the second quarter. However, such technology upgrades escalate the expense level, which might have eroded its margins.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies from the Business Services space, which according to our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Lightspeed Commerce Inc.

248,a2a27726-9b76-3706-9e05-b92a0398c206,MCD,2023-07-29,15 Best Stocks Under $15,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-best-stocks-under-15-194909970.html,1690573749,STORY,"['COTY', 'MCD', 'PLUG', 'VALE', 'ET', 'NYCB', 'YMM', 'VOD', 'KEY']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 best stocks under $15. If you want to skip our take on the economy and the stock market, then head on over to 5 Best Stocks Under $15. July has been the tone setting month when it comes to the future of the U.S. economy. Throughout the month, multiple data sets have been released which indicate that not only does inflation appear to be cooling down but the economy might also remain resilient enough to avoid a recession that has been feared since mid 2022. The latest bit of economic data, that might have changed the status quo about what to expect from the economy and even the stock market later this year is the fresh GDP report from the Commerce Department. According to this data set, the American economy grew by 2.4% in the second quarter of 2023 - a figure that appears quite remarkable when we consider that output actually reduced in Q2 2022. The 2.4% GDP growth rate marked an acceleration over Q1 2023, and at the same time, while both total and disposable incomes grew, the rate of their growth slowed down as a tighter credit environment takes hold.The effects of this data on the stock market were rather muted as investors, already wary of the Federal Reserve's relentless tendency to raise interest rates, were fearful that the stronger economy gives the central bank more room to increase the rates by avoiding damage to the economy. In fact, the U.S. economy growth rate data came a day after the bank had raised interest rates by 25 basis points to take them to a 22 year high. As part of comments made with his decision, Fed chairman Jerome Powell pointed out that his staff was not forecasting a recession in the U.S. this year, and considering the rapid rate of interest rate hikes, the bank can afford to take a break and evaluate the economy before it delivers more hikes.At the same time, if the wage and labor market does not significantly slow down, then the Fed might raise rates even more if it thinks that higher incomes keep inflation above the bank's target range of 2%. On top of prices, the Commerce Department's economic growth data also outlined that the gross domestic purchases price index increased by 1.9% in the second quarter, slowing down from the 3.8% reading in Q1 2023. The Fed's preferred metric, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index without the impact of food and energy was up by 3.8% for a good drop over Q1 reading of 4.9%.Story continuesAnother crucial data set that can serve as a crystal ball of sorts for the rest of the year is earnings. Big firms often share their expectations for the short term, and on this front, we're lucky since corporate heavyweights such as McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski shared that his firm has not seen consumer sentiment shift and in fact it might be on a recovery trajectory to meet 2019 levels. This is probably due to the fact that higher disposable incomes have enabled people to keep up spending, and McDonald's is seeing strong interest from people earning between $45,000 and $100,000.And JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)'s CEO Jamie Dimon and CFO Jeremy Barnum shared their important insights into the economy during the bank's second quarter of 2023 earnings where they shared:Jeremy Barnum: Yes. So I am sure, Jamie has some views here. But in my in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super positive conclusions based on a couple of recent trends. And I think generally our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don’t get too much euphoria that over concentrates people on one particular predictions when we know that there is a range of outcomes out there. So obviously, we were talking a lot about the potential for a soft lending right now. No lending, neither, it’s inflation or whatever and — whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully. I don’t know, but the broader point is we continue to be quite focused on, Jamie’s prior comments that loss rates still have time to — room to normalize even both pandemics we’re probably over-earning on credit a little bit Obviously, we’ve talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit, so even, forgetting about whether you’ve got some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy is always today even in the central case, you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization.Jamie Dimon: Yes. I would just add, the 5.8% [unemployment rate] is not our prediction, that is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have to use which hypothetical for CECL. Asset predictions on something different and we don’t know the outcome. We trying to be really clear here, the consumer in good shape, their spending down their excess cash. That’s all. Tailwinds. If we go into recession, we’re going with rather good condition, low borrowings and good, our price-value still but the headwinds are substantial and somewhat unprecedented. There is more Ukraine Oil Gas, market, timing, unprecedented fiscal, needs of governments, few team which we’ve never experienced before, I just think people should take a deep breath of that and we don’t know those things because the soft landing in mild recession for our recession. And obviously, sure we will be the best.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some great stocks to buy that trade for less than $15. Some top picks are First Horizon Corporation (NYSE:FHN), Roivant Sciences Ltd. (NYSE:ROIV), and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.

Over the last year, McDonald's has also made a big stride to reach those who remember certain beloved characters from the chain's past — last October, the chain launched its ""Adult Happy Meals"" with 1970s and 1980s-era character figurines like the Hamburglar and Grimace. Another major announcement to come out of the July 27 second-quarter earnings call is the launch of a new restaurant concept — while sparse on details of what this would look like, chief executive Chris Kempczinski said that it would start testing ""a small handful of sites"" known as CosMc ""in a limited geography"" in early 2024.Continue reading]"

Reported EPS is $2.55, expectations were $2.52.Operator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald's Second Quarter 2023 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.Mike Cieplak: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski; and Chief Financial Officer, Ian Borden. As a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our Website as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and then reenter the queue for any additional questions. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our Web site. And now I'll turn it over to Chris.Chris Kempczinski: Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Last quarter, I talked about consistency, consistency in our numbers, consistency in the drivers of our business and consistency in the excitement across the system about the opportunities ahead. This quarter, the theme is -- well, if I'm being honest, the theme was Grimace. I mean, Grimace has been everywhere the past few months, all over the news and more than 3 billion views on TikTok. Not bad for a 52nd birthday. This viral phenomenon is yet another proof point of the power of marketing at McDonald's today. Aside from Grimace, what really stood out about this past quarter was our continued consistency. In Q2, we delivered yet another quarter of strong performance, achieving global comparable sales of 11.7% with double digit comparable sales across each of our segments.Story continuesWe're operating from a position of strength and continuing to gain share in most of our major markets despite headwinds and a challenging macro environment. The reason for this continued consistency is simple, our Accelerating the Arches playbook is working to help create a better customer experience. Renewed focus on the fundamentals, in part fueled by the reintroduction of the PACE program, has led to operational improvements and continued increases in customer satisfaction across most of our major markets. To further strengthen our foundation of running great restaurants, we recently created a Chief Restaurant Officer role in markets to keep our market teams focused on driving our strategic plan, execution and performance. Market CROs will also help ensure that innovative ideas generated in local restaurants can be leveraged in markets across the globe.Our success is fueling even greater ambitions. We're continuing to double down on our existing growth pillars while evolving our strategy through accelerating the organization to stay front footed with an eye towards the future. As we've previously shared, accelerating the organization is an initiative to reimagine how we work to bring the full breadth of McDonald's skills and experiences together to come up with the best solutions that can be scaled. We're bringing this to life through One McDonald's Way, horizontal ways of working and digitizing the organization. While we're just beginning to change our ways of working, we're already seeing early benefits. I've often said that the next great solution will come from our markets and in our restaurants.As I recently visited markets like China, Italy and Germany, I continue to be inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit of our system and how market teams are embracing these principles even more consistently. Visiting China truly brought to life the power of a highly digitized economy and our potential for global growth moving forward. With about 90% of our business currently coming through digital channels in that market, it was remarkable to see how the market has forged digital relationships with customers. China is also making tremendous progress in running the restaurants more efficiently, all with the use of data and technology. This will provide great learnings for the rest of our system. Our Canadian team is implementing a rigorous initiative review process to relentlessly prioritize work to actively stop projects that are less important and focus on solving the most meaningful problems for our customers.Using a new framework, the team has already cut their number of key business projects in half. We intend to learn from and scale this process to other markets as well. Additionally, our UK and Ireland team recently traveled to Germany to learn best practices from the market's best burger rollout. This is a prime example of the agile scaling of solutions and horizontal ways of working. And finally, last November, we launched our largest globally unified marketing campaign ever, Wanna Go to McDonald's, to celebrate the FIFA Men's World Cup. We're thrilled to extend this award winning brand platform with the FIFA Women's World Cup and write a new chapter in the story to meet this iconic cultural moment. This campaign will be brought to life in 28 markets through fully integrated social, digital streaming and content strategies that tap into local fan excitement.These are just a few examples of how a One McDonald's Way approach to common challenges will drive greater connectivity and efficiency worldwide. Key to enabling the company's scale solutions with speed and agility is the work of our new Global Business Services business unit, or GBS. GBS will unlock further efficiencies and capabilities of our people and resources. We will do this by developing digital tools for the organization, making data and insights more accessible across the system and growing our future talent pipeline. We'll continue to keep you updated on how our ongoing investment in this area will benefit the enterprise in the years to come. In addition to our accelerating the organization efforts, we're also focused on evolving our approach to capturing incremental customer visits.Central to that is restaurant development, also known as our fourth D. Our strong performance and strength of our brand has earned us the right to begin accelerating the pace of restaurant openings in our major markets over the next several years. While our primary focus is on opening traditional units, we are always testing and learning new ways to meet the needs of our customers. One example is the takeaway only restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas that opened in 2022. The restaurant site is considerably smaller than a traditional restaurant and as the way customers order and receive their food has changed dramatically over the past few years is geared toward customers based on their need state wherever they are. Another recent example of innovation I was able to see firsthand during my visit to China is the use of food lockers at busy locations with high in-store traffic.Upon arrival, delivery couriers can quickly unlock the designated locker and grab the customer's order without even entering the restaurant, removing friction for both the kitchen and the courier. And our new business ventures team is in the process of developing a new concept we will call [CosMc's], which we will test in a small handful of sites in a limited geography beginning early next year. [CosMc's] is a small format concept with all the DNA of McDonald's but its own unique personality. We look forward to providing you with more information about our development plans and new format innovations at our Investor Day at the end of the year. Finally, before I hand it to Ian, I want to recognize our teams and business partners in France who have handled the unrest in the market with remarkable strength and grace.It has been extremely disruptive to the business on top of an already challenging operating environment. Thanks to everyone connected to McDonald's brands for your dedication and commitment to the business as well as your efforts to keep everyone safe during this volatile time. I'll now turn it over to Ian.Ian Borden: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, the second quarter was yet another demonstration of consistently strong performance, guided by our Accelerating the Arches strategy and fueled by our outstanding execution. We're delivering delicious feel good moments to our customers in new and exciting ways by doubling down on our creative excellence and highlighting our core menu, all with the value and convenience our customers expect. Our performance speaks for itself and is a testament to the passion and dedication of our entire McDonald's system. With global comparable sales of 11.7% and consistent performance across our segments, it's clear that the McDonald's brand has never been stronger. In fact, the brand was at the center this quarter as we engage with customers in authentic and culturally relevant ways with campaigns rooted in consumer insights.As Chris touched on a few minutes ago, we took the nostalgic experience of celebrating birthdays at McDonald's and repackaged it for a new generation with none other than Grimace at the center. It quickly became one of our most socially engaging campaigns of all time with millions of reactions on our social media posts, a true demonstration of how the power of our brand emerges in organic and creative ways in our fans. It contributed to the strong double digit comparable sales growth for the quarter in the US. The passion for the brand was also evident in Italy with the launch of a truly unique creative platform. It celebrated the most loved and best selling beef burger in the market by asking customers, what would you do for a crispy McBacon?The answer came in the form of customers getting tattoos of their favorite McDonald's sandwich, driving brand affinity and elevating share gains. I've certainly seen a lot in my 30 years at McDonald's but this was a new one for me. Truly remarkable. As I’ve mentioned before, our chicken equities remain at the core of our growth strategy. The UK celebrated the 40th anniversary of another fan favorite, the Chicken McNuggets, by offering limited time sauces to reconnect with the Gen Z consumer. This was coupled with compelling media that showcased the fan truth that sharing your nuggets isn't guaranteed, even if your best friends. China also highlighted the Chicken McNuggets anniversary in a creative way with an integrated marketing campaign.10 Easiest Fast Food Jobs to Get in Americasaknakorn / Shutterstock.comFeaturing our 20-piece nuggets, it quickly went viral on social media and generated significant positive buzz among consumers. Spicy McNuggets, one of our most popular line extensions, were offered across various markets this quarter, including Australia and Germany. It is yet another example of how we modernize our core menu, adapt it to meet changing customer taste profiles and scale these new ideas across the globe. Both markets achieved significant lifts to the McNuggets line as a result and Spicy McNugget sales reached an all time high in Australia. Our ambition on chicken includes further scaling emerging equities across markets. The McCrispy Chicken Sandwich, for example, has now scaled to over 10 of our largest markets, including Spain just this past quarter.The sandwich is already resonating with our customers, bringing attention to our chicken portfolio and driving significant chicken share gains. A recent addition to our portfolio of billion dollar brands, the McCrispy continues to be an important catalyst of chicken growth for many of our markets. The UK, for example, has achieved market share leadership in chicken, a remarkable growth over the past few years with the launch of both the McCrispy and the McSpicy Chicken sandwiches. We look forward to further scaling these new global favorites to customers around the world. A challenging macro environment including rising interest rates and elevated costs continues to create volatile consumer confidence levels and put pressure on consumer spending.Providing customers with an affordable option has always been core to McDonald's. But in these challenging times, it is even more important for us to remain agile, proactively meeting the needs of our customers. Germany continued the success of its McSmart menu. Initially introduced last quarter to provide entry level affordable meals, it's contributed to our best sales quarter ever in the market and lifted value perceptions with consumers. The UK unveiled a similar offering with its new Saver Meal deals in June, and the early results are encouraging. A permanent addition to the menu, it aims to provide consistent everyday affordability and ensure customers can still enjoy their favorite treats like the Double Cheeseburger despite the rising cost environment.Maintaining our leadership position in value is crucial to future success, and McDonald's holds the number one position in good value for money and affordability across most of our major markets. This shows that even in the most challenging of environments, our customers know that they can rely on McDonald's to provide an affordable destination for the food that they love. But we know that customers' perceptions on value are made up of more than just the price of our food. It's also about the experience that we provide. We've continued to enhance the customer experience, providing the seamless and memorable interactions our customers have come to expect. Last quarter, we introduced an enhanced ordering process through our app in the US with the goal of delivering a faster and more enjoyable experience for the customer.While we're still learning from this deployment, early results have been extremely positive with elevated sales initiated through the app, increased customer satisfaction and improved service times. Canada also introduced new experiences in the app with the launch of the Frequent Fryer program. Tapping into Canadians’ passion for travel, the digital campaign celebrated McDonald's fries and the opportunity to taste them in other countries. This creative approach to reengage with our loyalty members resulted in lifts to both digital acquisition and digital customer frequency during the campaign. Now in over 50 markets across the globe, we're continuing to build stronger relationships with our loyalty customers and fueling growth of our digital sales in the process.In our top six markets, digital sales represent nearly 40% of system wide sales and our loyalty members remain highly engaged with over 52 million 90 day active members across our top six markets. As our relationships with these customers continue to grow, we will unlock additional customer needs and explore investments for continued digital innovation at a scale that only McDonald's can achieve. Strong execution across all elements of Accelerating the Arches is creating additional customer demand and share gains across most of our major markets. But we recognize that we're operating in a challenging macro environment where costs remain elevated, customer discretionary spending is limited and industry traffic is pressured. In line with industry trends and as inflation begins to normalize later in the year, we expect top line growth to moderate.Turning to the P&amp;L. Our strong top line performance across each of our segments drove adjusted earnings per share of $3.17 for the quarter, an increase over the prior year of 25% in constant currencies, excluding other charges and gains in both periods as well as a prior year tax settlement. Our company operated margin performance for the first half of 2023 is in line with our expectations and remains hampered by continued cost pressures. As we look to the remainder of the year, we expect macro headwinds will continue. Total restaurant margin dollars grew by nearly $450 million in constant currencies or nearly 14% for the quarter. Strong franchise sales performance continues to be offset by targeted and temporary franchisee assistance, provided mainly to our European franchisees where elevated costs continue to pressure restaurant cash flows.We're still anticipating that these efforts will have an impact of $100 million to $150 million for the year. G&amp;A for the quarter decreased 6% in constant currency, primarily driven by prior year costs incurred for our worldwide convention last April and timing of anticipated current year spend. We are pleased with our strong adjusted operating margin of just over 47% for the first half of the year. This was driven by the continued strong top line growth that I mentioned and timing within our G&amp;A spend. For the full year, we now expect adjusted operating margin to be about 46%, reflecting heavier G&amp;A spend in the back half of the year, along with an expected property gain in other operating income in quarter four. And our adjusted effective tax rate was just over 18% for the quarter.And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris.Chris Kempczinski: Thanks, Ian. As I've said before, McDonald's Corporation is in the business of selling a brand. Our investments through Accelerating the Arches to create cultural conversations and develop industry leading innovations have increased the value of our brand and kept us relevant. In June, McDonald's earned an impressive 18 lions across 10 markets at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Additionally, our team in the UK and Ireland was awarded the prestigious Marketing Society's Grand Prix, which recognizes the best marketer in the country. The McDonald's brand also rose to the number five spot in the 2023 Kantar BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands report, behind only the leading tech industry brands.As we've upped our marketing game, it's also been interesting to see how our food quality scores with customers have continued to increase. The more customers love our brand, the more they love our food. Beyond the great brand stories created by our marketing teams and agency partners are the thousands of franchisees around the world who create real life brand stories every day in the restaurants with our customers. Our franchisees and crew bring the McDonald's brand to life with great hospitality, convenience and service. The best brand in the industry backed by the best franchisees has been our value creation formula for decades. We're always looking ahead to what is next and asking ourselves, how do we continue to create the world's greatest franchising opportunity for the world's greatest franchisees for generations to come.This requires making decisions for the long term to earn our success rather than expecting it or assuming it. Our Accelerating the Arches strategy is focused on just that, setting up the company and our franchisees to continue to prosper. Laying the foundation for the future also involve strongly defending the franchise system and independent ownership rights, a position echoed by the National Franchise Leadership Alliance, the elected representative voice of McDonald's franchise organizations across the US. I'm confident that the system is focused on the right priorities and is well positioned to meet the customer needs of tomorrow. Thank you to the over 2 million talented people working in our restaurants, our thousands of franchisees and our entire network of suppliers around the world who bring the McDonald's experience to life each day.I'll now turn it over to Mike for Q&amp;A.See also 12 Best Growth Stocks Under $25 and 20 Countries With Highest Rates Of AIDS.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

And now I'll turn the call over to Chris.Story continuesChristopher H. PetersonThank you, Sofya. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter call. Second quarter results were in line with or ahead of our projections on all key metrics. As expected, top line results were pressured by normalizing category trends, constrained consumer spending on discretionary products and retailer inventory destocking.Operating margins, earnings per share and cash flow were all well ahead of expectations as we made meaningful progress on productivity initiatives and working capital reduction. While our results met or exceeded our expectations for the quarter, on an absolute basis, we aspire for significant improvement going forward. That is why we recently created and deployed a new corporate strategy based on a comprehensive company-wide capability assessment with an integrated set of where to play and how to win choices. We're very excited about the clarity this work is bringing to the business and the value creation opportunity ahead of us, but we also recognize that the path forward will not be a straight line.During our first quarter earnings call, we laid out 5 key priorities for fiscal 2023, which are all progressing nicely. Let me say just a few words regarding each of them. First, starting with operating cash flow. Year-to-date, we have driven a year-over-year improvement of over $700 million, largely by rightsizing our inventory levels through improved forecasting and supply planning processes.Second, gross margin performance improved sequentially behind our ongoing FUEL productivity program and Project Ovid, which you will recall completely transform Newell's domestic go-to-market operations. We are on track for a record high year on productivity savings across the supply chain.Third, Project Phoenix is simplifying and strengthening the organization by leveraging scale, reducing complexity, streamlining the operating model and driving operational efficiencies. The program is pacing well and is on track to deliver $220 million to $250 million in pretax savings upon its full implementation.Fourth, our SKU count, which was over 100,000 as recently as 5 years ago, is expected to be down to less than 25,000 by the end of the year with numerous other complexity reduction actions also underway.Finally, we have successfully transitioned to and are operating in a new operating model with 3 segments: Centralized Manufacturing and Supply Chain and a One Newell approach with our top 4 customers and across most geographies. It is from this much improved operational and organizational foundation that we made an important wear-to-play choice to focus on and drive a disproportionate amount of our organizational and financial resources to our top 25 brands and our top 10 countries, which each represent about 90% of sales and profits. Once that decision was made, we turned our attention to our how-to-win choices, which were fully informed by the capability assessment we have just completed. That assessment clearly demonstrated the need for us to significantly improve our abilities in consumer and customer understanding, innovation, brand building, brand communication and retail execution. That's why when we revealed our new strategy in Paris last month, we said we are making a major pivot in our front-end consumer-facing capabilities to properly support leading brands in top countries.Since these how-to-win choices are cornerstone elements of the new integrated strategy, we have started to fill talent gaps across key areas and have established clear action plans and KPIs for each capability improvement project. For example, we are upgrading the company's ability to understand consumer and customer wants and needs. This should enable actionable insights around superior product development, leading to stronger claims in a more impactful and focused innovation pipeline as we concentrate on fewer, bigger and longer lasting innovations.In addition, we recently revamped Newell's innovation process, which will be underpinned by proprietary consumer insights. As part of this work, we designed and instituted a project tiering system and implemented an enterprise-wide biannual innovation process to sharpen the company's innovation plans, drive alignment on the funnel and determine prioritization and resource allocation as we identify bigger bets. We also put in place a centralized tracking system for all new initiatives to enable multiyear technology platforms and ensure appropriate financial rigor to drive accretive margins.Relative to brand building and brand communication, we are building out a comprehensive brand management function, which was not in place previously. Going forward, Newell's brand managers and the multifunctional teams who support them will be responsible for profitably growing our top 25 brands in our top 10 countries, alongside a newly redesigned brand communications governance process.Finally, as it relates to retail execution, our sales teams are leveraging the portfolio of Newell's leading brands and scale to actively pursue new distribution opportunities, which they've identified across every business while also dramatically improving our sales fundamentals in existing accounts. Although it's still early days, I'm encouraged by the progress we are making in bringing the integrated set of where to play and how to win strategies to life.Importantly, these are not just corporate plans, they've been formally cascaded throughout the organization, informing the segment, functional and regional strategies where work is ongoing. Key members of the leadership team and I have visited 6 of our top 10 countries across Europe and Latin America in the last 2 months to ensure we are driving the strategy into execution.Now before turning the call over to Mark, who will discuss our financial results and outlook in detail, I want to address the revisions we have made to our top line estimates for the second half of the year. First, we are incrementally more cautious on the consumption of discretionary products, largely due to the resumption of student loan payments in October. As payments restart after a multiyear moratorium, many consumers will undoubtedly have to manage their budgets even tighter given persistently high core inflation, which has lowered real consumer income.Second, several of our major retail customers recently revised their shipping terms on our business, moving from what is known as direct import to domestic fulfillment. While we welcome this move because we expect this change to be a positive for Newell longer term, it does put additional onetime pressure on back half shipments as their weeks of inventory coverage comes down further as a result of the transition.Lastly, we are now planning the business -- the Baby business more conservatively in the back half of the year due to the bankruptcy of buybuyBaby. Up until now, we assumed in our financial modeling that a buyer would emerge for most of their stores, since that is no longer likely we have adjusted our sales forecast accordingly.Revising our top line outlook and related demand plan now allows us to continue the strong progress we have made on inventory reduction, which is why we are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance for the year.Additionally, we are taking bold actions to drive stronger productivity in the supply chain, which were made possible by our recent decision to consolidate our supply chain into a centralized organization structure. Specifically, after benchmarking indirect overhead at each of Newell's key facilities, we are taking a series of discrete site-specific actions to rightsize the company's manufacturing labor force. These decisions are never easy, but we are committed to building a One Newell optimized global manufacturing network that minimizes total landed cost, optimizes asset utilization and leverages Newell's global scale.Moving forward, we are assessing how to optimize the company's entire plant network as we look to transition to more regionalized, multi-sourced plants with upgraded automation and digitization capabilities where appropriate. We will, of course, share more of the relevant details as plans are finalized.These top line revisions notwithstanding, we remain optimistic on the back-to-school season, which kicks into full year in the coming weeks, and we continue to expect much stronger performance for the company in the back half relative to the first half of the year. The pace of change has accelerated across the company, and we are moving with speed and agility to unlock the full potential of the enterprise.On a personal note, I would like to thank Newell's employees for welcoming me as their new CEO and for their strong endorsement of the new company strategy. At its core, our new strategy focuses on improving the company's consumer-facing capabilities while distorting investment to the most attractive value pools and simultaneously building upon the strengthened operational and organizational foundation we have built over the past several years. Their unwavering commitment to our purpose of delighting consumers by lighting up everyday moments inspires me every day. We have plenty of work ahead, but I sincerely believe we are off to a great start. While we continue to navigate through a challenging macroeconomic backdrop in the near term, I remain confident in our ability to accelerate the company's financial performance over the long term.I will now hand the call over to Mark.Mark J. ErcegThanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. As Chris indicated earlier, our Q2 results continue to reflect the significant macro-driven top line pressures we have been contending with since the third quarter of last year. Namely, soft consumer demand as inflation continued to put pressure on discretionary spending and some categories continue to normalize along with trade inventory destocking and the bankruptcy of a major retailer.Thus, while the 13% contraction in net sales of $2.2 billion and the 11.9% decline in core sales might on the surface be discouraging, we believe a more thorough examination shows the interventions we have made to improve the underlying structural economics of the business and strength in operating cash flow are working as intended. For example, normalized gross margin and operating margin both improved sequentially due to enhanced productivity efforts and Project Phoenix savings, which were critical in helping mitigate the significant 400 basis point headwind during the quarter from inflation. Nonetheless, Newell's normalized operating margin contracted 490 basis points versus last year to 9.1% as normalized gross margin declined 320 basis points versus last year to 29.9%, and top line softness resulted in a 160 basis point increase in the normalized SG&amp;A sales ratio.In addition, during the second quarter, net interest expense did increase $21 million to $76 million, reflecting overall higher debt and interest rates versus a year ago, but the decision to rightsize the dividend in a nearly $700 million year-over-year reduction in inventory allowed us to lower debt levels versus last quarter by nearly $300 million.Our effective normalized tax rate of 13.7% was slightly below a year ago, which when combined with the other elements we just reviewed, brought normalized diluted earnings per share at $0.24, which was considerably better than the $0.10 to $0.18 outlook we had previously provided.Turning to operating cash flow. The planning team did a great job managing inventory levels down while increasing fill rates, which in North America improved to 94% year-to-date from 82% last year. This allowed us to generate $277 million of positive operating cash flow year-to-date through the second quarter.Importantly, this stands in stark contrast to a $450 million use of cash during the same period last year. Therefore, through the first 6 months of 2023, operating cash flow improved by more than $700 million. And encouragingly, in transit inventory, as of June 30, was approximately $275 million below year-ago levels. So we are confident inventory levels will be even lower throughout the balance of the year.The company's leverage increased to 6.3x at the end of Q2, which was nearly 1 full turn better than anticipated. We believe leverage has peaked and expected to drop to approximately 5x by the end of the year. Our long-term goal is to achieve leverage at 2.5x.As we look towards the balance of the year, Chris laid out the incremental top line pressures we are facing, so I will not reiterate them. However, it does bear mentioning that this additional sales compression, coupled with our decision to lower inventory balances even further, does create a short-term fixed cost absorption challenge. Although we are aggressively optimizing the company's manufacturing labor force within the confines of our existing plant network, fixed cost deleveraging will still weigh on our second half gross and operating margins.Second half operating margin will also be impacted by our decision to invest in capability building and brand support to implement and accelerate critical aspects of our new corporate strategy. Given that context, we've assumed the following for the third quarter. Net sales of $2.11 billion to $2.16 billion with core sales down 7% to 5%.Traditionally, we do not respectively comment on gross margin, but in this instance, we think it's important to point out third quarter normalized gross margin is expected to represent an inflection point as strong productivity gains inclusive of our simplification efforts and July 1 pricing activity across roughly 30% of our U.S. business, primarily in the Home and Commercial Solutions segment are only partially offset by inflation and fixed cost absorption.We expect SG&amp;A to be higher on a year-over-year basis in both dollar terms and as a percentage of sales as we increase brand support and invest in front-end capabilities such as consumer and customer understanding, revenue growth management, data analytics and retail execution, among others. Parenthetically, last year's third quarter SG&amp;A was favorably impacted by a meaningful drop in management compensation accruals.Third quarter normalized operating margin is expected to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.4%. While this is admittedly down versus last year, the rate of decline is expected to ease relative to both Q2 and the first half as the structural economics of the business should continue to improve. We forecast interest expense to be substantially higher year-over-year and expect a mid-teens tax rate. All in, we are guiding to normalized third quarter earnings per share in the range of $0.20 to $0.24. For the full year, we expect net sales of $8.2 billion to $8.34 billion driven by a core sales decline of 12% to 10%. Normalized operating margin is expected to be 7.8% to 8.2% as we reflect the negative top line flow-through and incremental capability investments discussed earlier.Interest expense is forecasted to be up slightly versus a year ago, and the tax team has done some terrific planning work, which should create a sizable tax benefit in the fourth quarter. Assuming that benefit is realized, the full year normalized effective tax rate is expected to be close to zero. Normalized diluted earnings per share are now expected to be $0.80 to $0.90.Relative to cash, which was our #1 priority this year, we continue to anticipate $700 million to $900 million of operating cash flow, inclusive of $95 million to $120 million of cash payments related to Project Phoenix, which remains on track to realize $140 million to $160 million of pretax savings this year. The midpoint of our operating cash flow range implies operating cash flow will improve by more than $1 billion year-over-year with free cash flow productivity comfortably above 100%.So with all that said, let's summarize the key takeaways from today's call. First, top line pressures are expected to persist throughout the balance of the year. But as core inflation moderates, trade destocking slows and we cycle against easier comps, we anticipate that our top line results will improve on a relative basis.Second, we believe the underlying structural economics of the business will improve in the back half behind significant interventions across all facets of the business. In fact, at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect second half normalized operating margin to expand over 200 basis points versus a year ago and more than 350 basis points versus the first half of this year.Frankly, this would be a good outcome since, again, using the midpoint of our range, full year net sales are expected to be down approximately $1.2 billion versus last year. Moreover, since we expect inventory to drop by approximately 25% year-over-year and the July 1 price increase that negatively impact unit volume, what could reasonably assume production volumes will be down this year by 20% to 25%. Thus, the amount of cost takeout required to hold Newell's gross margin flat, let alone expand it against this backdrop, is not inconsequential and should provide significant positive financial leverage once the macroeconomic environment stabilizes and we begin to see the benefits of the major pivot we are making in our front-end consumer-facing capabilities.Third, the year-over-year increase in operating cash flow is expected to be at least $1 billion, which speaks for itself.Finally, we now have a unified corporate strategy based on a comprehensive company-wide capability assessment with very clear where-to-play and how-to-win choices. We believe strongly in the strategy and are investing behind it as we move with deliberate speed to unlock the full potential of Newell's portfolio of leading brands.Operator, if you could, please open the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question coming from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist Securities.William Bates ChappellJust I guess trying to understand the front-facing moves right now in terms of its looking more or sounding more with brand managers and focus on core brands, kind of a P&amp;G model. And I guess, historically, a lot of the Newell's categories don't have a whole lot of marketing or advertising or promotional support. And so it was kind of deemed as not always that necessary. So I'm just trying to understand, going forward, you're going to be stepping up and doing more merchandising, marketing, stuff like that when a lot of your competitors won't. And so I'm just trying to understand how useful this will be. I mean certainly it will help, but how you kind of looked at the categories when applying this model to it.Christopher H. PetersonYes. That's helpful. Let me try to provide a little bit of perspective. One of the things that we identified when we did the capability assessment was that because we're coming from a place where every business unit in every category was operated sort of independently, we did not have centralized, standardized processes and approaches on the front-end capability like we've been driving over the last 4 years on the supply chain in the back end.And so when you look at the company's performance, you can see pockets of good performance. So if you look at the most recent periods, we're growing market share on brands like Sharpie, on Rubbermaid, on EXPO, on Crock-Pot, but we're not growing market share on a wide swath of other brands. And we believe the reason we're not growing market share broadly across the company is because we don't yet have the capability in place on consumer and customer understanding, innovation, brand building, brand communication and retail execution consistently across all parts of the portfolio.We do believe because we're starting from leading brands in our top 25 brands, over 2/3 of them are leading brands in the categories in which we compete, we do believe that this model applies broadly. We've seen examples based on all of the businesses that we're in of the people that are growing market share are in fact applying this model. And so we think as we begin to drive and standardize and build this capability more broadly across the company and apply the same amount of operational rigor to it that we've done over the last several years on the supply chain and the back office, we think we can have a meaningful inflection point in terms of getting to a more sustainable top line growth algorithm.William Bates ChappellGot it. And I can't remember if I'm allowed a follow-up, but I'll ask one anyways. Mark, can you just maybe give us a breakdown of the -- in terms of the guidance, what like buybuyBaby, what the change in terms with retailers, in terms of inventory, how -- what -- any -- just kind of roughly how that's negatively impacting in buckets the guidance for the top line for this year?Mark J. ErcegYes. Let me help you out with that. So you might get a little bit more than you were anticipating here, but let's be clear on this point. So our prior range was $0.95 to $1 rate and we said we'd be towards the lower end of that range. So let's just take $0.95 as the starting point. From there, Chris enumerated a number of items that are going to lower our sales in the back half, so I won't repeat those here. But that's obviously fairly consequential.Along with that, we have chosen to take our inventory levels even lower in order to ensure that we can maintain our cash flow range for the full year. In addition, we have some capability investments that we are making, which we cited some A&amp;P investments that we talked about as well. And then there's a little bit of other items in there that are kind of mix related. Those items are only partially offset by a meaningful progression in our programs related to cost takeout. This year will be an all-time high. We actually expect to take out about 6% of COGS through the FUEL initiative programs that we have in place.And then there'll be a little bit of resin help, a little bit more transportation help, a little bit of positive FX in the second half of the year. So taking all those elements together, that would take you from roughly $0.95, let's call it, down to $0.70. And then we have a tax benefit that we have contemplated and put in. That's worth roughly $0.15. That brings you to $0.85, which is the midpoint of the new range that we provided of $0.80 to $0.90.Christopher H. PetersonAnd Bill, on the top line of the 3 factors I cited, I would say that the student loan repayment and the more conservative stance on discretionary products as the first item and the direct import to domestic shift are the 2 biggest of those items. The buybuyBaby is a little bit smaller relative to the top line guidance change.OperatorAnd our next question coming from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James.Olivia Tong CheangGreat. My first question is on gross margin. You gave a lot of detail on the changes to your sales outlook, but hoping to get some color on gross margin, which continue to show some sequential progress. And assuming you continue to see that sequential progress, should we expect it to turn positive in the second half? Is that a fair assumption? And if so, could you talk about some of the drivers that are underlying that?Mark J. ErcegYes. Thank you. We feel really good about where we are with gross margin right now. If you looked at our first quarter results, gross margin was roughly 27% in the print that we just issued, gross margin was 29.8%, so meaningful progression. And as we think about the first half versus the second half dynamics, we're very confident that second half gross margin will be several hundreds of basis points higher than where we were in the first half, probably 300-400.What's driving that is the FUEL productivity program that has been in place for a number of years now, but that program has only increased in its intensity now that we have consolidated the supply chain behind the Phoenix organizational changes. We are literally on pace to take about 6% of COGS out of the gross margin line this year alone, which is quite important because we're still dealing with a lot of the after effects of inflation. Inflation in the first half of the year is probably running around 400 basis points to the negative in the second half, we think it will be more like 100 basis points of compression because of inflation itself.The other things that we're doing that we talked about in the past was DC consolidation work where we're going to be going from effectively, call it, 1.9 million square feet of space down to maybe 1.5 million. The network might go from 30 DCs down to something more like 20. We talked about in the script, the fact that we have just recently done a 4-wall cost assessment that will save, on an annualized basis, over $50 million by getting after overhead and plant overhead and indirect operational elements, along with some direct shifting crews and there's just a whole range of other things on the VAVE side that we're also getting after.So we feel like the productivity program is only gaining strength, and that's one of the reasons we feel good about gross margins. Also, there's a lot of other things at play like the pricing effect that we just put in, 471, which will bring a bunch of additional pricing into the second half. So yes, we feel very good about where we are with gross margin. I think as you know, we've had a gross margin compression every year since the Jarden acquisition. And this is the year that we're hoping to turn that around.Olivia Tong CheangGot it. And then given your updated views on resource allocation across brands and categories and geographies, can you give us some idea on whether there are brands that are potentially seeing more spend rather than less and then the level of divergence you're expecting versus where it currently stands on the brands that are going to see less support?Christopher H. PetersonYes. We are -- as part of our plan, we are spending more money on A&amp;P. So the A&amp;P spend that we planned in the back half of the year is up versus last year and significantly up versus the front half of this year, and it is disproportionately focused on our leading brands.So for example, we feel -- and part of the reason we feel very good about the back-to-school period, which we're just entering, is that our customer service results have improved markedly, as Mark mentioned, from fill rates in the low 80s to fill rates in the mid- to high 90s on the Writing business. We've had a terrific sell-in, in back-to-school, the Writing business, despite the core sales for the company being down in Q2, the Writing business was up in Q2 on core sales.Our share of retailer assets has improved this year versus prior year. And because of that, we are planning to spend more money in A&amp;P this year than last year against that because we believe we're well positioned for the season. We obviously haven't seen consumption yet, but we believe that's a good use of investment dollars.At the same time, we said when we rolled out the strategy that we have 80 master brands and there's 25 that represent 90% of the sales and profits that we're going to be focusing on. So at the same time, we are deprioritizing spending on those bottom 55 brands because we believe the return on investment is much higher on the top 25.OperatorAnd our next question coming from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.Andrea Faria TeixeiraI wanted to go back to what you just said to Olivia's question on the 55 brands, Chris. And of course, this company has been through a huge transformation in kind of optimizing selling brands and doing all of that and all kind of deleveraging that you went through. I wonder if there is any thought to be made on some of these brands being divested.And conversely, I just want to think about like why is the sell like some of the -- as you go through this. Or this is something that you're going to reassess post all this transformation process that these projects are still giving you and starting to give you this year?And then on your comment and just a clarification on your comment about back-to-school, of course, you haven't seen consumption yet. Is this category also going through in your view, some of the reductions that retailers have been going through for inventory? Or this is pretty much more immune given that there's still positive impacts from reopening and office and all of that?Christopher H. PetersonYes. So let me start with the back-to-school question. The Writing business -- the Writing category is a little different. It is not going through the same dynamics on retailer destocking, consumer discretionary pullback, et cetera. The Writing business is much more normalized. We feel very confident that we are set up to gain market share during this back-to-school period depending on which projection you look at. Some people project the Writing category to be slightly down versus last year. Some people project it to be flat and some people to be up slightly. I think we're trying to take a middle-of-the-road view on that, but we're very confident that we're set up very well to gain market share during the period.On the 55 brand question, that represent 10% of the company's sales and profits. I would put those 55 brands into 3 buckets. The largest bucket of the 55 are brands that we are going to continue to sell, but we just are going to support less, so to speak, in terms of innovation resources. We will continue to support them fully in terms of sales resources, but we think our innovation resources, our A&amp;P dollars are better spent on the top 25 than this other category. So consider that sort of a milk type column, if you will, for those brands.There's a second category of brands that we are going to proactively look to discontinue. And these are brands that represent a very small percent of the company's revenues and profits and, frankly, are a distraction. And we believe we're better off just delisting them because we don't believe they're saleable, we don't believe they're significant and we don't think it's worth it to even go through the effort of trying to sell them. So there'll be some brands in that category.And then there's a third category where we're going to look to do something different and that could be a divestiture or a licensing type opportunity. That will be a small subset. I don't think you're going to see massive change like we've had in the past from an M&amp;A divestiture standpoint. That is not our strategy. We believe that we have a strong portfolio. We just want to focus our efforts and our resources on the biggest brands that are market leading, which represent 90% of the sales and profit of the company.Andrea Faria TeixeiraAnd Chris, just a follow-up on that. The -- so thinking about the 10% headwind on that eventually we're going to see happening. Of course, we don't know the size of each of the buckets that you just described. But assuming that there's like, call it, mid-single-digit potential headwind, if you were to simply delist some of these to your second bucket or potentially sell, like is that something that we should be worried about into 2024 that could be a headwind? Or you're going to manage these gradually?Christopher H. PetersonYes. I think we're going to manage it gradually. I don't expect it to be that high. I think could there be a period in the future where we have a low single-digit headwind from this possibly, but I think this is going to be an over time thing. I don't think it will rise to a mid-single-digit type level in any given year.OperatorAnd our next question coming from the line of Peter Grom with UBS.Peter K. GromSo thank you so much for the color on the building blocks and for guidance this year. But I was just hoping to understand the implied ramp in the fourth quarter just in terms of operating margin. It just seems the outlook implies several hundred basis points of operating margin expansion. So you sounded quite optimistic on gross margin. So can you just unpack that? Or what's implied in the fourth quarter a bit?And then back in June, you kind of mentioned core sales below algorithm, operating margin expansion on algorithm for the next -- I think it was 12 to 18 months, but it just seems that the exit rate would be implying something well ahead of that. So is there anything specific about 4Q that we really shouldn't be extrapolating in terms of thinking about operating margin expansion into next year?Mark J. ErcegNo, it's a great question. So look, I guess this is what I'd offer and this is what I would say. Without getting bogged down in quarter dynamics, as we think about the first half versus the second half, and as I just mentioned earlier, think gross margin is going to continue to grow sequentially through the balance of the year, and we actually expect the second half gross margin to be roughly 400 basis points above the first half for all the reasons I cited, the FUEL productivity efforts and everything that's going along with it, the pricing effects that are in place. There's some normal business seasonality, where we tend to have a slightly higher percentage of our total year sales in the back half. We think the trade destocking will abate as we go further along. Our comps get easier. We have more E&amp;O in the first half than the second half. There's a whole litany of reasons why we're very, very confident that we have that progression right.With gross margin growing so strongly, we also see operating income percent of sales following along as well. And we have that up roughly the same amount by about 400 basis points. One of the things I think is notable as we talk about the capability investments we're making, I think we've demonstrated the ability to affect cost in a very positive way, and you're seeing that through the gross margin line. If you think about what we're doing as it relates to overhead, however, overhead dollars in the first half versus the second half will be roughly comparable because we're choosing to make investments in talent upgrades, change management capabilities, process improvements, data and technology enhancements. And then on the A&amp;P side, you heard Chris mentioned it earlier, we're actually going to probably be spending 50% more in the second half than we spent on the first where we have compelling consumer propositions.And if we think about the question that was asked earlier about the smaller brands, maybe being a drag on the business, that might be true in part, but we believe the focus that's going to be put against the top 25 brands and the additional resources that go against those will more than offset that as we really start to accelerate on the top line in that regard.With your question about the commentary we provided at Deutsche Bank, when we talked about the next 12 to 18 months, I don't think what we provided there was explicit guidance per se. What we tried to say was that the next 12 to 18 months is going to be characterized by a number of external challenges where inflation is still going to be moderate to high or some level of destocking.I think the mild recession that we are concerned about is maybe less relevant now. It seems like maybe we'll avoid that which would be a good thing. But during that time, we're going to be fronting dollars towards the capability build-out that we've spoken to and doing the brand rationalization efforts. So we had said that core sales will be below our evergreen target, we think that's true. We said free cash flow productivity will be at or above. And this year, we're targeting over 100 now based on the good work that's being done.And then there would be operating margin expansion at the evergreen target, which is roughly 50 basis points. Again, that wasn't explicit guidance for any given quarter. This year, clearly, we have really strong progression on operating income as a percent of sales in the second half versus the first. And we are going to be, over time, making some choices to balance the bottom line progression on margin with additional A&amp;P investments that we choose to make in order to put more marketing support behind our top brands. So it's going to be a balanced approach going forward. We feel really good about where we are. If you look at sequentially across every element of the P&amp;L, it's playing out the way that we would have hoped.Peter K. GromNo, that's super helpful. And then, Chris, I just had a question on visibility. Kind of the second straight quarter here where things are moving a bit lower, particularly around the quarter sales outlook. And you've historically been very prudent. So I guess I just -- has visibility improved to the point where you feel like you can kind of get back to that conservatism, if you will, in the outlook so that we don't really see another call down? Or does it still remain a bit murky?Christopher H. PetersonYes. What I would say on visibility is it is a challenging visibility period, primarily because we're dealing with the normalization from a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic of COVID. We're dealing with this massive inflation that's starting to come down and the impact that's having on consumer purchases. We're dealing with retailer patterns on inventory that are unusual in nature as a result. The visibility is getting better. I will say that we were encouraged that we came in right in the middle of our top line guidance range for Q2 on core sales growth. So we hit the mark on the Q2 guidance. Obviously, the further out you go, the more challenging it is to provide top line guidance.The thing that we're focused on is what's in our control. And we are moving at pace on the capability investments. We have brought in new talent, a President of Brand Management and Innovation, a new Head of Consumer Insights, we've changed out leadership in the Outdoor &amp; Recreation segment. And we have chartered projects specifically to go after improvement in the areas we talked about, consumer and customer understanding, innovation, brand building, brand communication and retail execution and we are driving a pace on that.And we believe that those things will play out over the next 12 to 18 months. They're not going to happen immediately because these things take some amount of time. But when we -- the thing that we're excited about is as we begin to make those improvements, when you couple that with a very high-performing supply chain and back office organization that's delivering record cost takeout levels, we're very optimistic about where we can take this business over the next couple of years.OperatorOur next question coming from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.Lauren Rae LiebermanI know it might seem crazy to want to look way further out at this point. But I guess I was just curious, you guys have talked about evergreen 50 basis points on average margin expansion. But what about the conversation kind of longer-term P&amp;L benchmarking because I understand unequivocally the opportunity that could be ahead in terms of positive operating leverage with all the structural cost takeout that you're doing, getting to a more stable and stronger and predictable top line. But I'm just kind of not sure how to think about the reinvestment and capabilities as well. And so even like if I look at, trying with my numbers right now, if I look at general expense, like should I be thinking about '24 as kind of reaching a benchmark level of proper investment in the business and that you're making that step change this year? Or I guess, over a 4-quarter period, probably -- or does that keep building? So just anything you can offer on maybe longer-term benchmarking on structure of the P&amp;L would be helpful if you're willing to go there.Christopher H. PetersonYes. Let me try to provide a little bit of help. So let me start with '24. I think in '24, we're likely to have -- we've got a number of things that are effectively onetime in nature in '23 that should allow '24 to be a bit of a bounce back year in terms of operating margin. So -- and I'll just give you a few of them.Inflation, which was -- is significant, particularly in the first half of this year, largely because of capitalized variances that are rolling off should be behind us. And as a result, based on what we're seeing today, we expect inflation to be a much smaller number in '24 than it was in '23.We also expect fixed cost absorption to be a materially smaller impact in '24 than '23 because recall that this year, we're dealing with the revenue decline, plus we're taking inventory down on top of that. And so that fixed cost absorption number is somewhat onetime in nature. We also mentioned that our productivity is ramping up, and we've got a very strong funnel that we believe is going to continue to drive very strong productivity next year.In addition to that, this year, as we're reducing inventory, we are being aggressive on what we call excess and obsolete inventory so that we end the year with a clean inventory level. And some of that excess and obsolete inventory, we are liquidating at a discount that we don't think we'll have to do as we head into next year as we've gotten our inventory levels better. And then obviously, the retailer inventory destocking is somewhat onetime in nature.And so all of those things would tell you that in '24, we should have an above-algorithm year certainly on margins and that's what we're shooting for. I don't believe that '24 is the end of the margin story, though. I think we have a significant opportunity going forward to continue to build operating margins for the next, really, 3 to 5 years because a lot of the front-facing capability that we're putting in place is also in addition to getting top line growth going, going to get margin going. Because when you develop category driving innovation that is focused on large leading brands that is targeted for the MPP and HPP segments, which our strategy calls for, those tend to be gross margin accretive initiatives and that is our strategy.And so as we put this consumer-facing capability in place, we believe that our innovation pipeline will get stronger, we believe the innovation pipeline will lead to better category growth, better market share gains and gross margin improvement from a mix standpoint. And so all of those things have us confident that the longer-term margin opportunity in this business is significantly higher than where we are today.Mark J. ErcegYes. And Lauren, if I could add just one point that I think is relevant. We had gross margin right around 30% in Q2. We talked about the fact that the second half is going to be considerably stronger for the reasons that Chris just reiterated. So our exit rate will be several hundred basis points beyond that. And that's when we're still operating 46 manufacturing sites with capacity utilization, frankly, now given where we are, probably in the low 30s, 90% of which are single sourced and many of which aren't in the right geographic locations to really optimize the global supply chain.So we think we have tremendous opportunity on the cost takeout side as well as all the innovation that we brought forward. It'll be more MPP, HPP to push that meaningfully forward, which will give us, I think, the ability to spend more in A&amp;P, also expand our operating margins considerably over time, while we get more efficient on the overhead line as the sales revenue starts to come back to us. So we feel very good about the proposition of us monetizing this business over any reasonable period of time.OperatorAnd our next question coming from the line of Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank.Stephen Robert R. PowersSo everything you just articulated makes good sense to me and is exciting. I do want to kind of circle back to what Peter was asking about in terms of the commentary a few months ago about the next 12 to 18 months, not being a straight line. Everything, Chris, Mark, you just described about exiting '23 and then bounce back year in '24 seems to run counter to that next 12 to 18 months being a lot more grounded. So I mean, maybe it's just a change in kind of macro assumptions, but just seems like a very different message as to how we think about back half '23 and '24 grounded in June commentary versus grounded in your recent commentary. So if you can just square that circle for me?Christopher H. PetersonYes. I think if you step back, I think that we're trying to drive significant capability improvement in a turnaround situation that the company is in, in a tough macro context that is hard to predict. And when you put those things together and you say the macro environment currently is a headwind, we think it's going to turn to a tailwind or at least moderate, but it's hard to predict exactly when that's going to happen.We know that we're on the right track from the strategy that we've just deployed 6 weeks ago, but we also know that it's going to take time to drive these capability improvements because there are significant changes to the way the company operates. And we're moving the company into a new operating model with Project Phoenix. And so it's hard to predict exactly which quarter do those capability investments show up. We're very confident that they show up in the financial results 2 to 3 years from now, but whether they show up next quarter or the quarter after or the quarter after that is hard to predict.And so I think the message that we were trying to deliver on the path forward, not being a straight line, is we believe that the line is going from the lower left to the upper right. We just don't -- can't tell you on a quarter-by-quarter basis exactly what the slope of that line is going to be. But if you look back a couple of years from now from where we are today, we believe you're going to have seen significant and material improvement in the performance of the company.Mark J. ErcegRight. And if I could add one thing. And during that period, when we said core sales growth would be below the evergreen targets because of obviously all the reasons that we've been discussing today, we were saying that, look, cash is going to be our top priority and it's going to be moving forward above our target. And this year, we're going to be -- probably be 100% free cash flow productivity or better.And then the operating margin expansion is going to continue in part because the gross margin take out so big and so extreme and we're very confident that it's going to come to pass. I mean so we feel like over the next 12 to 18 months, sales might be a real challenge, but margin will progress and cash will be our focus.Stephen Robert R. PowersOkay. Okay. Okay. And I guess, is there -- as part of the strategy, there are a lot of top line accelerators over the course of time and kind of margin expansion drivers. I don't -- I guess I'm -- maybe at this point, is there kind of like a time order prioritization of where you think this kind of more the low-hanging fruit is versus more of the kind of longer-term aspirational elements of that? But then as we go forward, do you anticipate we'll -- communicating some kind of scorecard against those, we can track progress? Or how are you thinking about both achieving them and also kind of communicating your progress as we go?Christopher H. PetersonYes. I think it's a good thought. And we obviously have an internal scorecard that's very detailed that we have just sort of put together. So once we finalize the strategy, we effectively chartered capability improvement projects with clear KPIs, owners, time lines against each of them. And we are pursuing all of them simultaneously.They have different time lines relative to the execution. So the consumer and customer understanding capability improvement, plan and time line, for example, looks different than creating a brand management organization time line. And so we will endeavor to provide some more clarity on that as we go forward. I think we're at the place where we've commissioned all the projects. We have owners, we have time lines, we have a clear plan and we're up and running. We're not delaying on any project, which is why I mentioned in the prepared remarks that the pace of change at the company is accelerating dramatically because we're taking on a lot in terms of capability improvements.The last thing I would say is that if you were to rate how difficult is it to do these capability improvements, typically, when you think about capability improvement, oftentimes people think about changing the people, the process and/or the technology. We've made dramatic improvement in the supply chain and in the back office and simplification that we've been talking about over the last couple of years, whether it'd be the ERP systems, the IT applications, the FUEL productivity program, the SKU count, et cetera, all has -- all of that has gone well. That actually is harder to do than what we're talking about on the front end because -- and that back -- and the supply chain in the back end, oftentimes, there's a meaningful technology component that is required that takes longer. In the front end, it tends to be more people and process focused. So it doesn't mean it's easy, but it can happen faster and so we have chartered the projects and the owners on aggressive time lines to begin to make progress.OperatorAnd our last question comes from the line of Filippo Falorni from Citi.Filippo FalorniI know we covered a lot of ground. I just want to end maybe, Chris, you clearly announced a lot of strategic changes that's coming on, the more recent changes on the front end, the kind of the restructuring programs, changes in capital allocation. Any other areas where you think like there's more focus on your end, like in terms of potential further changes in the organization that we should be thinking about?Christopher H. PetersonI think we're at a point where with the operating model change, with the capability assessment and the new strategy we've deployed, we're at a point where I think we've done all of the strategy work from a company standpoint at this point or at least we've got the 90 for the 10, let's call it. Our focus now is shifting to drive that strategy into execution. And rather than sort of debate the strategy at this point, we think we've got the right strategy and a strategy doesn't really come to life unless you execute it at the point of attack and we need to drive that strategy into execution. And that takes time because you have to communicate it to the segments. You've got to communicate it to the geographies. You have to communicate it to the functions. You've got to make sure that as you're cascading that strategy throughout the organization, it ultimately gets into every individual's work plan.And as you do that, you begin to change the trajectory and the direction of the enterprise. And so I don't expect that we're going to have significant changes in strategy at this point. I expect what you're going to hear us talk more about is our progress at driving the strategy into action and execution.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. A replay of today's call will be available later today on the company's website at ir.newellbrands.com. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.]"

My name is Gigi, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to T. Rowe Price's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded and will be available for replay on T. Rowe Price's website shortly after the call concludes.I will now turn the call over to Linsley Carruth, T. Rowe Price's Director of Investor Relations.Linsley CarruthHello, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. The press release and a supplemental materials document can be found on our IR website at investors.troweprice.com. Today's call will last approximately 45 minutes. Our CEO and President, Rob Sharps and CFO, Jen Dardis, will discuss the company's results for about 15 minutes, and then we'll open it up to your questions. We ask that you limit it to one question per participant. I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements and reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the forward-looking statement language and the reconciliations to GAAP in the supplemental materials as well as in our press release and 10-Q.Now I'll turn it over to Rob.Story continuesRobert W. SharpsThank you, Linsley, and thank you all for joining us today. While equity outflows continued in the second quarter, we saw improved performance in a number of important investment strategies. Stronger equity markets helped lift revenue from first quarter levels, and we identified substantial cost savings that will allow us to meaningfully slow expense growth while continuing to pursue our strategic initiatives.On today's call, I'll give an overview of our investment performance, followed by a brief update on the key milestones we reached in advancing our strategic initiatives. Jen will then provide a detailed view of our financial results before we take your questions. Overall, second quarter investment performance was encouraging, with reasonably solid results across asset classes and the percentage of funds outperforming their peers increasing from the prior quarter. The U.S. large cap growth franchise outperformed this quarter with blue chip growth, gross stock and large-cap growth posting top quartile results versus peers and beating their benchmarks.Our U.S. equity research and mid-cap value strategies continued to deliver strong performance. In contrast, the large-cap value franchise, a bright spot in 2022 gave back some of its relative outperformance in the first half of 2023. However, the long-term results remain favorable. Our target date franchise delivered another strong quarter of performance with all of our flagship retirement funds ranking in the top quartile.Performance in fixed income and international equity was solid as well, with the majority of funds in both segments outperforming peer groups and a number of products, including global multisector bond and U.S. high yield in the top decile for the quarter. Our global stock, overseas stock and several of our municipal bond strategies were top quartile performers in the second quarter and all have strong 3-, 5- and 10-year performance track records.Despite these gains, organic growth remains under pressure. As we reported, net outflows for the second quarter were $20 billion. The sales and redemption patterns that we saw in the first quarter largely continued in the second. U.S. equity outflows were primarily driven by U.S. large-cap growth strategies as market demand remained muted and we saw the lagging impact of past investment performance on sales and redemptions. International and global outflows slowed with improved market demand and better performance. Fixed income net flows declined from the prior quarter as rates rose and demand softened. Target Date products had net inflows of $2.4 billion for the quarter.To protect our ability to invest in our corporate strategy and deliver for our clients, we are proactively managing expense growth. We are pursuing a number of efforts to manage expenses, drive efficiency and create a cost structure that's appropriate for the size and scale of our firm today. Jen will discuss these efforts in greater detail. But since the fourth quarter of 2022, we have taken steps to remove or reallocate over $200 million in run rate cost for 2024. This work partly reflects ongoing company and industry challenges, but also reflects a broader commitment to efficiency, process improvement and durability, driving a culture of continuous improvement and innovation with an agile mindset.Institutionalizing this work will allow us to better invest in our corporate strategy and continue to deliver for our clients, even in challenging times. Our corporate strategy is focused on areas where we believe we have the greatest opportunity for growth and long-term success. In the second quarter, we advanced efforts to deepen our client partnerships, expand our investment in operational capabilities and continue to broaden our global reach. We've made important hires and met some key milestones. We are making steady progress in bolstering our USI wealth channel by fortifying partnerships with the largest intermediary firms in the industry.Clients expect compelling investment strategies offered in a variety of vehicles to meet their needs, and we made progress delivering on both this quarter. On June 15, we launched 5 fully transparent active equity ETFs, which are already generating client interest and inflows. Our existing lineup of 15 ETFs now at $1.5 billion in AUM is steadily building momentum. We continue to fill out our roster of SMA strategies with the addition of 4 muni and 2 equity SMA strategies this quarter. We finalized the seed commitment for our first joint co-branded product with OHA, Hero Price OHA Select Private Credit Fund, or OCredit and closed for our business development company, or BDC, election filing on June 30. The filing is a key legal milestone for the launch, which is planned for later this year.We also hired a head of U.S. intermediary, alternative sales, and we'll continue to invest in resources and expertise to support this effort. We closed on our acquisition of Retiree Inc., which will enhance our ability to expand and retain relationships with pre-retiree and retiree clients, by providing tax aware retirement income and social security claiming strategies. With this acquisition, we demonstrate our commitment to expanding and evolving our already strong retirement capabilities.So while our flows continue to reflect lingering challenges, we are making clear progress. Our work on driving efficiencies and managing expenses will allow us to continue to invest to deliver for our clients and support future growth. I'm impressed by the resiliency and commitment of our associates, and I remain confident in the long-term fundamental value that a global active investment management firm like T. Rowe Price can deliver no matter the environment. I'll now turn to Jen to cover our financial results for the second quarter.Jennifer Benson DardisThank you, Rob, and hello, everyone. I will begin today by reviewing our financial results and will provide additional detail on our expense management efforts before we open the line for questions. As reported, our adjusted earnings per share was $2.02 for Q2 2023 versus $1.69 in Q1 2023. An increase from both higher revenues and carefully managed expense growth. Q2 2023 EPS was also favorably impacted by a lower quarterly effective tax rate. We ended the quarter with $1.4 trillion in AUM, an increase of $58 billion from March 31, 2023, driven by market appreciation and partially offset by net outflows.Our average assets for the quarter were $1.36 trillion, up from Q1 2023, but down almost $50 billion from Q2 2022. As Rob mentioned, we posted $20 billion in net outflows for the quarter. Across the entire complex, we continue to see clients taking longer to make decisions based on current market volatility, which is resulting in lower sales and net inflows than we've seen in prior years. Industry-wide, active equity and fixed income fund flows have been muted for over a year.We expect that this slowdown is cyclical and will revert to more normal patterns as the direction of interest rates, inflation and the likelihood of a recession become clearer. Also consistent with last quarter, our U.S. large-cap growth equity products drove a majority of the outflows, and we are seeing performance-related lower sales and elevated redemptions from a range of clients. It will take some time for the recent performance improvement in these products to slow the outflows. Positive inflows for the quarter included U.S. equity research, capital appreciation, international core and all-cap opportunities.We also had net inflows to international fixed income driven by global investment grade, global multi-sector and euro corporate bond. However, the inflows to international fixed income were more than offset by outflows from our U.S. fixed income stable value and floating rate products. Our target date net inflows were $2.4 billion for the quarter. While this was down from Q1, keep in mind that first quarter flows are typically the strongest given that a higher proportion of planned decisions happen around year-end. In the first half of the year, we recorded $9.9 billion of net inflows to our Target Date products.In response to changing market conditions and more available capacity, we have reopened to new investors some of our previously closed products, including mid-cap growth, small cap growth and emerging market equity, which we expect will support future sales and net flows. We also continue to evaluate the capacity levels for other closed strategies, and we'll consider reopening these in the future.Our Q2 adjusted net revenues were $1.6 billion, including $1.4 billion of investment advisory revenue that was up from Q1 2023 on equity market gains. Our effective fee rate was 42.3 basis points back to the same level it was in Q4 2022 after a slight uptick in the first quarter of 2023. Our adjusted operating expenses were a little over $1 billion, which was generally flat to the first quarter of this year, but up 8.3% from the second quarter of 2022. The year-over-year change was largely driven by the change in capital allocation-based income-related compensation.As a reminder, in the second quarter last year, there was negative capital allocation-based income, which created an expense offset. Excluding the compensation expense related to capital allocation based income, adjusted operating expenses were up 1.8% over the same period last year, with compensation and related costs up less than 1% year-over-year. We continue to forecast our 2023 adjusted operating expense growth, excluding capital allocation-based income-related compensation expense, will be in the range of 2% to 6% over the comparable full year 2022 amount of $4.1 billion. Based on current market conditions, we still expect to land at or below the midpoint of this range.As Rob mentioned, we are pursuing a number of efforts to proactively manage our expense growth and drive efficiency. Last week, we internally communicated the difficult decision to eliminate approximately 2% of our existing positions globally. We have also slowed the pace of hiring and headcount growth by closing select open positions across the firm. All of these actions have been based on a careful review to make sure we are aligning our resources to best support our clients and drive long-term growth for the firm. Based on our current pace of hiring against our strategic initiatives, we expect head count at the end of 2023 to be modestly higher than the start of the year, even with the reductions I just mentioned.Most of the costs related to the recent reduction in force will be incurred in the third quarter and are already included in our expense guidance. As we move forward, we remain committed to finding ways to be more efficient and drive a culture of continuous improvement. For example, we are evaluating our current real estate use in light of our new hybrid work approach with the objective of slowing our occupancy and facilities expense growth. It will be some time, however, before any impact to expenses from real estate would be realized. In total, between the expense efforts we took last year and this year, we will have removed or reallocated over $200 million in operating expenses versus the run rate for 2024.This financial discipline will allow us to continue investing in our strategic initiatives to support future growth while positioning us for low single-digit adjusted operating expense growth in 2024. Excluding the impact of capital allocation-based income-related compensation. We will refine these estimates as we get closer to year-end. As always, this estimate is based on current market levels and we could choose to adjust it if markets rise or fall significantly.Shifting to capital management. We found some buying opportunities in May and June, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to over 420,000 shares at an average price of just over $107 per share or $45 million total. We remain opportunistic in our approach to buybacks. However, given continued market uncertainty, we are being patient in the process. Supporting our recurring dividend remains a top priority. And in the first half of 2023, we returned over $600 million to stockholders. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample liquidity to support both our seed capital program and potential M&amp;A. We are confident in the efforts we've identified to drive efficiency and slow our expense growth as we continue to manage the business to support our clients and return the firm to organic growth over time.As Rob said, institutionalizing this work will allow us to better invest in our corporate strategy and continue to deliver value for our clients, even in challenging times.With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan.Kenneth Brooks WorthingtonPerformance has improved in a number of your most prominent growth funds. And while outflows were still elevated in 2Q, are you seeing any early indications that the better near-term performance is starting to positively impact the net sales outlook? And if so, what distribution channels are benefiting? And if not, which channels would you expect to come back more quickly to reflect the improved performance given your comments that the time line for decision-making has been extended?Robert W. SharpsYes, Ken. Thank you for the question. This is Rob. With regard to the large cap growth franchise, as you note, meaningfully better performance in the second quarter and year-to-date. With regard to whether the improved performance is translating into better flows, the direct answer is at the margin, but it's way too early to call this a trend. Our experience suggests that performance impact flows with a lag that for institutional buyers, the 3- and 5-year numbers are important considerations. And while we have very compelling performance on a year-to-date basis and attractive performance on a 1-year basis, we do have further work to do on the 3- and 5-year numbers. In terms of what channels you might pick the early signals up or where you would expect it to improve earliest. It would be in USI Wealth and in the individual investor business. I think, again, the more sizable institutional decision-making tends to more heavily weigh 3- and 5-year.I think the pattern we would expect to see is a lessening of redemptions and then eventually a more meaningful pickup in gross sales. If I take a step back and talk about flows broadly, it's clearly the missing ingredient. Overall, I'm feeling better about things. I think we've been very front-footed in putting ourselves in a position where we can invest against our strategic initiatives, yet kind of have an appropriate level of expense growth. For now, at least, the market has given us a lift in revenues. And we're working really hard to put ourselves in a position where we can return to organic growth.As it stands today, the industry conditions are challenging. There is a lot of money on the sidelines. I don't think that will last forever, but it's difficult to know when it will ultimately come back. We'll need to continue to drive improved performance and ultimately, we'll need to execute against our strategic initiatives to become more central with our existing clients and to reach more clients.My sense is if you look at historical patterns, if we execute against those things and investors come off the sidelines and begin to invest with a more long-term orientation again, we should see meaningfully less in the way of outflows in 2024 and demonstrate that we can put the company on a path back to organic growth at some point in 2025. If I look at all of the leading indicators that I'm seeing right now, it suggests to me that we're experiencing the worst of the pressure on flows, which is another way of saying I wouldn't expect the run rate in the back half of the year to be greater than what we saw in the first half of the year.And as we work our way through '24, we think we'll see, as I say, noticeably less in the way of net outflows. But again, there are some things that have to happen in terms of the industry backdrop, in terms of our investment performance, which we're deeply focused on, and I'm encouraged by. And again, with regard to execution against all of our strategic initiatives.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Finian O'Shea from Wells Fargo Securities.Finian Patrick O'SheaA question on the active ETF launches. Can you talk about the success so far there as to the extent that they capture the outflows, say, of their sister mutual funds? And also on a high level, are you encouraged by what you're seeing? Or are there roadblocks for that strategy to gain traction?Robert W. SharpsLook, at a high level, I am encouraged by what we've been seeing more recently. I think active strategies delivered in the ETF vehicle have really started to garner more attention and interest across the industry. And we've continued to expand our lineup. Kind of we now have a broader range across equity and fixed income. And as noted, launched a series of new ETFs this quarter, we have particular early traction in the capital appreciation equity, ETF offering, but kind of broadly, we're getting more and more engagement and are increasingly encouraged by interest in ETFs. With regard to whether it's just cannibalizing the open-ended 40 Act business, I think there's an element of that, but I also think we're attracting a lot of new investors.What you find is that there are certain advisers that use ETFs exclusively. And until we had an ETF lineup, we weren't able to engage or deliver our strategies to those advisers. Tim Coyne and our USI wealth broker-dealer financial advisory team have done a really good job of getting out into the marketplace and ultimately, kind of giving people a sense for our strategies and why they could be appropriate in their clients' portfolios. And we're really pleased with how they're performing. We think there's a long way to go there. It's early days. And I would say, for us, the momentum has really just started to build, frankly, kind of over the course of the last several months.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies.Daniel Thomas FannonJen, I was hoping to expand a bit upon the expense commentary. So at or below the midpoint of this year, I assume that's based on kind of June 30 AUM levels? And then also would be curious about what kind of onetime or severance might be included in 3Q as you think about the actions that have been taken and then further, just on the commentary for next year, low single digits at this point. Does that include some of the real estate and longer-term potential cost saving thing actions that you mentioned? Or would that be above and beyond as we think about '25 and further?Jennifer Benson DardisThanks, Dan, I'll try to make sure I get all of those. So first, on the midpoint of the range -- at or below the midpoint of the range, as usual, we tend to look at an average of the month as you might have noticed in this particular quarter, the markets went straight up into the end of the quarter. So we tend to look at about a 30-day rolling average just to look at what the balance might be for the balance of the year. In terms of severance, there's about $15 million to $20 million worth of severance costs that would be reflected in Q3 and we would expect for the balance of the year, if you look at how things would roll into Q4, you would have that partially offset by some of the lower salaries based on the rules that departed in July.Just remember, as we think about how that expense guidance would roll into the end of the year, fourth quarter typically has our long-term incentive plans where new LTI plans are issued, and that tends to create a bit of a pop along with ad promo that tends to be more seasonal in the fourth quarter.And last, as we look into next year, that low single-digit guidance, it includes much of what I just mentioned, that includes the $200 million. The real estate savings would roll in over time. I would expect that would probably be more into the late '24 or early '25 time frame. But again, we're still going through planning for the year. We just wanted to give you a general sense for where next year might land.Robert W. SharpsYes. I'll just say a few words with regard to expense management, we're trying to take an approach that really reflects our long-term priorities. We do want to invest against our strategic initiatives and invest for growth. We want to invest in our talent and maintain our culture and have the ability to be central to our clients and reach more clients.In order to do that and sustain profitability in various market environments, we're going to have to be more efficient. We're going to have to be better at prioritization. We're going to have to make space to invest in and acquire new skills. So we should be able to drive additional savings through process improvement and optimization over time, but we're going to want to be able to use that to invest in our business and to put the company in a position to be successful over the long term.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America.Craig William SiegenthalerWe're coming up on the 2-year anniversary of the Oak Hill acquisition announcement. So maybe this is a good time to provide us an update on the M&amp;A effort and also get your thoughts on potentially acquiring another private market manager. Maybe one with a focus on real estate or infrastructure.Robert W. SharpsYes, Craig, thank you for the question. Look, our priorities with regard to M&amp;A typically don't change quarter-to-quarter. We are constantly evaluating opportunities to add new capabilities that we don't currently offer and that are important to our clients. We typically evaluate that relative to developing something organically. So we're evaluating strategic opportunities. It's a stated goal of ours to build our alternatives business over time. So it's natural that as opportunities present themselves in areas like real estate and infrastructure, as you suggest, that we would evaluate them.We're only going to do things that we believe are compelling. We're only going to do things where we believe there is real cultural fit. We want to associate ourselves with investors and teams that are performance oriented that are client focused and that have a long-term orientation. So when those opportunities present themselves, we're going to do work and ultimately feel like -- ultimately determine whether or not we should engage and do more work and whether it's something that we might move forward with.There isn't anything that's imminent right now, but this is an active time in the industry from a consolidation perspective. With regard to OHA, the Board and I continue to be very happy with the acquisition overall. I think the market backdrop is a little more challenging with regard to capital raising and deployment across private markets, private credit and private equity, but it's a moment in time. I'm very enthusiastic about OHA's business in the long term. They are talented investors with solid performance and a very strong reputation and great client relationships. I'm also encouraged by the work that our distribution teams are doing around the globe as they've spent time learning OHA's offering, and they are beginning to bring new opportunities from our client relationships to OHA.Last thing I'd say about this is I'm really excited about our joint BDC, where we've noted, we've secured $600 million of seed capital and are building a pipeline of intermediaries to partner with for distribution. Again, demand is muted in this space right now, but we think it's a compelling product. It's an area that we didn't serve in the past, either to reprice or OHA so we feel like we can have a preeminent product on those platforms when demand for the private credit BDC type vehicle comes back.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore.Glenn Paul SchorrSo I want to take a step back on the intermediary channel because it's a little bit weird time where the markets go up a lot yet, you have a bunch of outflows. So the question I have is, is the same performance drives flows on a lag basis? Is that relationship still what's driving things in here and as your performance started to improve, we should see things slow. That would be what history would say. But is it bigger than that now? Is -- are you seeing like just a massive product preference change in the channel, hence, the ETFs and SMAs that you've been putting out? Maybe you could lead in what the responsibilities of your new head of intermediate distribution might be in charge of making happen?Robert W. SharpsYes. Glenn, it's a good question. It is an unusual moment in time. If you look at where most of the inflows have come in the industry, it's been in passive, a lot of that in ETF and in money market. People are getting yields on money market funds that they haven't had in 15 years or more. And it's an uncertain environment. I think there are a lot of investors that are on the sidelines that are waiting for the Fed to get out of the way or waiting for a more attractive buying opportunity. I'd also say that it's been a narrow market. You note that the market is up quite a bit. It's been driven by kind of a very narrow portion of the market and a small number of overall names. So there hasn't been as broad participation, as you might expect.Look, I still believe that good performance will drive flows across vehicles. And we saw this quarter inflows into a number of strategies, including funds where performance was good. Again, I think longer term, there is a shift away from open-ended 40 Act mutual funds in favor of other vehicles. You see that in fund to trust migration in our retirement business.And as you noted, SMA and ETF are both growing more rapidly. But we're, I think, moving quickly to offer a broader range of strategies across those vehicles. So while the trends that you note are real, in terms of a shift to SMA with lower account minimums, more customization, tax loss optimization, shift to ETF, to some extent, a shift to thematic a shift to passive, I think those are things that we can navigate if we leverage our, I think, best-in-class global investment platform -- global research platform across equities and fixed income, all of those are opportunities that we should be able to address that I think we've made progress in building out our shelf space and availability, and we'll make further progress with going forward.So look, I deeply believe that there will always be a market for active management that excellent security selection will drive value, And I think it's incumbent on us to engage with our clients to understand kind of how we can deliver that value to them. So I think there's an element of this, Glenn, that is cyclical, that is kind of where we are today and kind of ultimately you'll see behavior change and money flow back to strategies where you have a very good performance. But there's also an element of it that I think is likely to be more enduring, which is why we're working hard on SMA, ETF, things like the OCredit BDC. We want to be more present and better represented in areas where we've been less well represented in the past because there are some changing demand trends.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.Brian Bertram BedellGreat. If I could just dive deeper in on 2 channels. The 401(k) channel, both DCIO and recordkeeping and then maybe contrasting that with the online brokerage platform channels like, for example, at Charles Schwab is just one of them. In the 401(k) channel, we saw elevated outflows in the institutional side of your business. So I assume that's concentrating in your 401(k). Maybe if you can just talk about whether there were any lumpy either mandate losses or something that drove that in the second quarter? And then are you seeing better potential trends in the DCIO versus the recordkeeping? And then on the online brokerage platforms, are you seeing better trends there? Are there more retail focused? They may be more performance sensitive not sure if it's a big enough contribution yet, but if you can just provide some color on those.Robert W. SharpsYes. I'll start and ask Jen to offer her perspective as well. I'll start with our retirement plan services business or our bundled 401(k) recordkeeping business. It's a business that, overall, I would characterize as healthy. We are growing in what we call the core market, which is below the large enterprise market. We are expanding our coverage of advisers that specialize in retirement and recordkeeping for small, medium-sized businesses. And kind of overall, I think it's a business that is executing quite well for us where we have some challenges in -- we often have planned deconversions when there is consolidation, where you have one of those large enterprises buy a mid-cap or more medium-sized company that's one of our clients. So that's pressured that business to some extent, but we've largely been able to offset that with growth in the core market. And I feel good about our momentum there. So I'll leave that for the 401(k) recordkeeping business.In terms of the DC investment-only or institutional defined contribution business, I'd say it's more mixed. We continue to meet with success in the retirement date franchise there, but it's an area where we were very well represented in large-cap growth. And we have had some terminations from plans as a result of performance in that channel, and that has put some pressure on flows. It's part of the reason why we've called it out. I think it's been particularly elevated or acute in the first part of this year. I don't think we're out of the woods yet with regard to that.But I think if we continue to drive performance and get back to our historical standards, eventually that will run its course.Jennifer Benson DardisYes. I'd add to that. I mean, if we think about -- we've been asked previously about trends in the DC, the defined contribution investment only versus our record cap business. Those are both important business lines for us, and we actually see the benefits of the work that we do, representing plan sponsors in that 401(k) recordkeeping business is able to help us think about plan design, it's able to help us think about product design, and it's really helped us to stay front of mind from an innovation perspective in both our target date products and in thinking about retirement income products going forward.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS.Brennan HawkenSo my understanding of T. Rowe's incentive comp is that you tend to skew to longer-term performance track records on the investment professional side. So just wanted to confirm if that's right and whether or not we -- number one, like what track records or which time periods are more important and have a bigger impact? And was the better-than-expected compensation expense this quarter beginning to reflect the fact that some of the longer-term track records have begun to deteriorate? And therefore, we could expect to see some continued tailwinds on the expense side from that dynamic.Robert W. SharpsYes, I'm not going to comment on specifically what the underlying drivers are of the compensation accrual. I will say that our approach and philosophy around incentive compensation does emphasize longer-term track records. And kind of how you define that really depends on the tenure of the investment professional. But we look not only at the current year results, but at 3, 5 and even 10-year results for long-tenured portfolio managers. So our incentives are basically designed to reflect the long-term performance for investment proposals.But you've got to remember, we have 8,000 associates. And we have people that are doing a lot of different things in the organization. We also have a very broad range of strategies. So kind of while we might have delivered disappointing 3- and 5-year results in certain strategies, we have other strategies where you have excellent results. So at the end of the day, as I've said before, we're really focused on -- from an expense perspective overall, making sure that we have the capacity to attract and retain world-class diverse talent and maintain our culture. And those are the things that I think are really essential for us to be able to deliver for our clients over time and to be able to deliver for our shareholders.Jennifer Benson DardisI think it is worth noting, as we talked about the steps that we've been taking from an expense perspective. We had the notable announcement where we took the actions with the 2% of existing roles. But in leading up to that, we've been working for the past several months at looking how we can actually slow down and close open roles, and that will have an impact on the expense growth rate in salaries. So trying to manage that over a period of time allows us to do that through closing open roles, not necessarily having to eliminate roles that have people in them. So you would see that flowing through in the impact of salaries.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mike Brown from KBW.Michael C. BrownSo Jennifer, as you noted, the market rally was particularly strong at the end of the quarter. So just wanted to see if you had any color about the exit fee rate here relative to the second quarter? And any puts and takes we should really consider here for the second half?Jennifer Benson DardisNo. I'd say, look, if you look at our trend over the last several years, 5 plus, we've had modest fee compression rates over the past several years in the range of 1% to 2%, depending on the actions that we've been taking to lower fees across different product lines and be competitive. So I would expect that wouldn't change. Obviously, in times of market rally, you'll see a little bit of an uptick as the business mix shifts, but nothing really specific to call out that's different from trends.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous.Patrick DavittSo T. Rowe is widely known to be one of the best places to work in asset management and you've obviously been able to maintain that strong culture and strong pay packages through the last decades plus [bull] market. But history would suggest that asset managers to start cutting more aggressively start to impact the investment management process and then ultimately, performance. So after now 2, I guess, waves of layoffs in a year, how are you balancing this new restraint on expenses with the risk that you negatively impact the investment franchise?Robert W. SharpsI think I've said this now maybe the third time. Our approach here is to have a balanced -- a balance between driving efficiency overall, and that's throughout the organization, making sure that we're getting value out of all of our roles, making sure that we are a company that is dynamic and in the long term has growth opportunity in a way that will allow us to sustain our culture and have the resources to compensate and attract top diverse talent throughout the organization, but particularly in investments.Look, our retention is very strong. I think we have a very strong culture. Our compensation is based on all of the market data that we have, very competitive, if not compelling. I expect it will remain the case. The vast majority of the head count initiatives did not impact investments. So it seems to be something that is very much top of mind for a handful of you all, but it's not something that I particularly am overly concerned with.It's something that we're always very, very focused on. But there's no question in my mind that we have the capacity and intent to make sure that our compensation practices are very competitive and that we have appropriate incentives in place for people throughout the organization. Again, the proofs in the pudding there, if you look at our investment professional retention, I think it's excellent. Our retention throughout the organization is quite strong. What we're doing, I think, is very consistent with what you've seen throughout the organization in almost every one of our peers. So in that way, I would say I do not think that we are an outlier. Jen, I don't know if you'd have anything to add.Jennifer Benson DardisYes, I think it's also important to put it in context. If we look at the last 5 years, we were coming off a period of very rapid investment in the business. We've added a number of capabilities across investments, distribution, technology, operations and globalization of the business over the -- again, over the past 5-plus years, to the tune of increasing operating expenses over $1 billion in run rate during that time frame. So these adjustments, I think these are nice moments in time to be able to take a look, make sure that we're doing things as efficiently as we can. And if we look at the -- particularly on the role side of things, there were 3 things we were trying to do. One was increasing efficiency in the way we work. So trying to look at processes, rebalancing work, making sure that we have -- we're doing things in the right ways with the most beneficial technology that we can. The second is just looking at a need for changing skill sets. As we look at places that Rob mentioned, new vehicles, making sure that we have our skills decked against the places where the business is going.And then the last thing is about pivoting and reprioritizing resources against these strategic priorities that we've been talking about. So some of this is about expense reduction. Some of this is about expense reallocation. And to help put it into context for next year, as we started the baseline work, our expense growth next year would have been somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 to 400 basis points higher from an expense growth perspective, if we were just investing in all new things in the business. So we view this, again, not only as an expense cutting exercise, but also as a reallocation to make sure we're investing in the right spot.Robert W. SharpsYes. And just to close the loop on this. For context, the role eliminations were roundly 2% of our global workforce and impacted multiple functions. The impact across investment divisions was minimal. You talk about dozens of people over a base of between 400 and 500 portfolio managers, associate portfolio managers, investment analysts across our -- all of our investment divisions. I think it's also important to understand that we've invested very steadily over time across our base of investment professionals. And we remain very confident in the strength of our global investment platform and our ability to deliver for clients. If you look back just to the -- since the end of 2013 to June 30 this year, our total number of investors has grown by over 25%. So if there's any sense or concern that we're not investing in our platform or taking care of our investment talent, I think it's misplaced.OperatorOur last question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.Michael J. CyprysMore of a big picture question for you. AI has been getting a lot of attention and focus across the world today. Just curious how you're thinking about the potential and opportunity from AI with respect to your business? Do you see this as more of a revenue or an expense play? What sort of impact could this have on the competitive landscape for the asset management industry? Maybe you could talk a little bit about how you're experimenting with this today or how you may experiment with that in the future.Jennifer Benson DardisSure. Thanks for the question. I think it's important here that I know a lot of people are talking about generative AI and the capabilities that have been rapidly evolving over the past several quarters versus machine learning AI, I'd say we've been investing behind that in certain parts of our business for some time now in our investment data insight team as an example, to make sure that we're using the benefits of machine learning in all of our processes.Specifically with regard to generative AI, we're looking at it across 2 fronts. One is from a risk perspective, just making sure that we have appropriate safeguards in place to protect data. And that's been one of the important things that we've been focused on in the early days. And then the second piece of that, we've been establishing pilots across the business just to evaluate what the capabilities are to make sure that we can implement generative AI in ways that will improve our ability to generate insights for clients, the ability to reach and impact new clients and also to drive efficiency across the business.So I'd say we're looking at pilots across our investment organization, across our distribution channels and within our technology organization specifically to look at how we can use that to drive efficiencies. So I think the opportunities are potentially significant over time, but it's early days, and we want to do it in a way that is durable.Robert W. SharpsAll right. I think that was the last question. So I'll just close by thanking everyone for joining us and for their interest in good questions. As we noted, we're encouraged by investment performance. We continue to be deeply focused on it. And I think we believe that while there are some lingering issues that will impact flows, we have a path to improvement as we work our way through 2024. We believe deeply in our corporate strategic initiatives, and I'm really encouraged by the dedication and commitment of our associates and their focus on delivering for our clients. So thank you.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

266,937cbc6b-4507-3e8c-8e35-d1402be972d8,UPS,2023-07-29,Teamster agreement a 'bad deal' for UPS: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/teamster-agreement-bad-deal-ups-203538499.html,1690576538,VIDEO,"['UPS', 'FDX']","[United Parcel Service (UPS) and the Teamsters union were able to reach an agreement and avert a strike that could have wide-ranging economic ripple effects. Broughton Capital Principal and Managing Partner Donald Broughton says it's a ""bad deal"" for UPS, citing labor costs. When it comes to why UPS made the deal, Broughton says the company was concerned about losing market share, claiming that shippers, growing concerned about a potential strike, were starting to turn to rival FedEx.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: UPS averting a strike by the Teamsters Union this week. News of the deal lifting weight off the shipping giant ahead of its second quarter earnings report on August 8. But investors may have some concerns about the rising costs for Big Brown, Teamsters saying that it was a $30 billion deal.Joining us now for more, we want to bring in Donald Broughton. He's a principal and managing partner at Broughton Capital. Donald, it's great to have you here. So I believe you expected the Teamsters to strike, but they didn't. Why were you a little bit surprised by this deal?DONALD BROUGHTON: Well, we thought that what was happening was that Sean O'Brien was positioning himself to have some theater, to have some marketing about what he could accomplish for labor and use that to first get as much as he could, extract as much as he could from corporate UPS. But then use that in turn to go to the Amazon workers and organize them because I think that's really his long-term goal. He said as much If you just listen.SEANA SMITH: Donald, what do you think of this deal just in terms of what it means for UPS because of what we know, it includes higher wages. And like I just said in the intro there, O'Brien saying that the agreement is worth $30 billion. So is that a good deal or a bad deal do you think for UPS?DONALD BROUGHTON: We think it's a bad deal. I mean, if you just look at the straight up-- the initial increase in pay, it jumps their wage line by almost $2 billion, $1.95 billion immediately. They're forced to hire 22,000 workers. They're forced to convert 7,500 workers from part time to full time. There's many stipulations that, quite frankly I'm surprised that they agreed to.Story continuesAnd the problem with that is this, see, it's one thing that you have to pay a union worker more. But the real cost is for many companies in unionized labor is not the per hour fee, it's that you can't get them to do multiple tasks. They're only going to do one thing. They're only going to sort packages. They're only going to drive a truck. They're only going to do one thing.And throughout any business day, we have different demands, different things need to be done. I don't know about you Seana, but I do multiple things. I take out the trash here at Broughton Capital if I need to, right? And you can't do that with a union employee. They'll say to them, well, that's not my job classification.And that lack of flexibility adds cost, and it adds a layer of complexity and an inability, quite frankly, to compete with people who are not unionized, who have more flexible labor. People who will do whatever you need them to do because they see it as we're just going to get the job done, we're going to take the hill.SEANA SMITH: And Donald, I'm still laughing about taking out the trash because I do agree with you, you are forced to do a lot of tasks, daily tasks, that maybe you didn't initially sign up for. But Donald, let's talk about what do you think, I guess, then forces UPS hand? Were they just too scared, too intimidated by what a potential strike would do to their company in the near term?DONALD BROUGHTON: Well, I don't think they were frightened as much as they understood what was happening to market share. Understand that these are-- part of the beauty of FedEx and UPS is these are large, very expensive networks. There are billions, hundreds of billions of dollars that have been invested over the years.And so that makes them-- you can't compete with them. There's a big moat around those businesses. That's the good news. The bad news is all those costs, all that money has been poured into the ground. And so incremental volume or lower volume has high incremental and decremental margins.If you go look back five years ago when the exact same thing was happening, UPS was trying to negotiate their contract with the Teamsters, FedEx did something very simple. They went out to customers and they said, look, there probably won't be a strike. But if there is, we're going to take care of the people who are our customers.It wasn't a threat. It was just a simple statement of fact. And as a result, they had not only outside-- had an outsized leap in their market share, amount of incremental business they got, but they actually raised price at a rate almost twice what UPS was, so you can't accuse them of buying that market share.And once you shift-- I can tell you, in my former life, I was a distribution manager. I routed freight for a living before I went to Wall Street. And what I will tell you is this, one of the axioms of that profession is that price may get you in the door but service keeps you here.If someone is taking care of-- on a consistent basis picking your things up and getting your things delivered, they're providing the service, you're not going to kick them out. So the customers that have shifted to FedEx aren't going to go back to UPS unless FedEx drops the ball on service.And I'm pretty sure that FedEx is not going to do that. So what I think was happening was this FedEx was doing the exact same thing, they've said so, that they did five years ago. But this time they were actually having even more success because many people, like myself, became convinced that a strike was very possible if not imminent.I talked to a number of people who still brought freight for a living. And they were all went from-- in the May to late June time frame went from there might be a strike 2. We are planning for a strike. Even UPS themselves made an announcement saying that they were training their white collar workers to do the jobs of the Teamsters, and they thought they could handle 20% to 25% of the volume should there be a strike. That's basically saying that UPS management themselves were expecting a strike.And so when shippers hear that they think, we don't want our parcels caught in the system. We need to shift over to FedEx. Let's take advantage of this. So they move. And as you're seeing more and more and more and more volume move over, the UPS management team I'm sure got a daily read of how much market share they were losing.They looked up and they said, you know what, we need to stop the bleeding while we can. Because they understand that, like I said, the decremental margins I think are really over 35%, 40%. And if you lose $1 billion worth of revenue, that's-- $350 to $400 million of operating profit.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, a heck of a lot of money and certainly UPS feeling that pressure. Donald Broughton, always great to get your perspective. Thanks so much.DONALD BROUGHTON: Thank you for having me.]"

Welcome everyone and thanks for joining this quarterly teleconference. I am pleased to report Martin Marietta’s exceptional performance across nearly every safety, financial and operational measure in the second quarter, which built upon our record first quarter performance. Given the overall challenging macroeconomic environment, including continued monetary policy tightening and the related residential housing slowdown, our strong quarterly performance is a testament to our team’s focus and resiliency of our differentiated business model. In addition to our results and consistent with our aggregates-led product strategy, we also finalized the divestiture of our Stockton, California cement import terminal in the second quarter, further enhancing our company’s margin profile and improving the durability of our business through cycles.As indicated in today’s earnings release, we revised our 2023 guidance to reflect the company’s results from the first half of the year and our current expectations for the second half. Notably, we raised our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance to range from $2 billion to $2.1 billion or a 28% increase at the midpoint as compared with the prior year. The core assumption underpinning the adjusted EBITDA guidance is that accelerated commercial momentum will more than offset lower shipments and higher costs as we endeavor to continue managing the last 2 years of historic inflation. Further, given the typical lag effect between single-family housing starts and aggregates demand, we expect recent aggregate shipments declines will find a bottom in the third quarter of 2023.Against that backdrop, Martin Marietta achieved strong second quarter results across a number of areas, including consolidated total revenues of $1.82 billion, an 11% increase; consolidated gross profit of $560 million, a 32% increase; adjusted EBITDA of $596 million, a 25% increase; and aggregates gross profit per ton of $6.80, a 28% increase. These stellar results reflect the continued disciplined execution of our strategic plan through economic cycles. Shifting now to our second quarter shipment and pricing results, starting with aggregates. Aggregate shipments declined 5.7% as we experienced the expected lag between last year’s decline in single-family housing starts and our shipments to the residential market. Predictably though, aggregates pricing fundamentals remain attractive, with pricing increasing 18.6% or 17% on a mix-adjusted basis.The Texas cement market continues to experience robust demand and tight supply amid near sold-out conditions, particularly in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Second quarter shipments were a record 1.1 million tons and pricing grew 21.8%. We fully expect that favorable Texas cement commercial dynamics will continue for the foreseeable future and expect solid realization of the $10 per ton price increase effective July 1. Shifting to our targeted downstream businesses, ready-mix concrete shipments decreased 1.7%, while pricing increased a robust 21.9%. Asphalt shipments increased 1.7% and pricing improved 7.9%. Before discussing our outlook for the remainder of 2023, I will turn the call over to Jim to conclude our second quarter discussion with a review of the company’s financial results.Jim?Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward and good day to everyone. The Building Materials business posted record second quarter revenues of $1.74 billion, an 11.6% increase over last year’s comparable period and a quarterly gross profit record of $536.1 million, a 34.3% increase. Aggregates gross profit improved 20.7% relative to the prior year period resulting in a quarterly record of $370.9 million as strong pricing growth and lower diesel fuel expenses more than offset lower shipments and increased non-energy-related costs. Our Texas cement business also continued its track record of exceptional performance. Revenues increased 21.7% to $197.7 million and gross profit increased 84% to $93.3 million. As previously discussed, our Midlothian, Texas plant is installing a new finish mill that we expect to be finished in the third quarter of 2024.Upon completion, the new finish mill will provide 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity in today’s sold-out Dallas-Fort Worth marketplace. This project will achieve its first major milestone this month as our new cement titles will begin loading customer trucks. The new silos and load-out system are dramatically improving customer service by reducing load-out cycle times by as much as 45 to 60 minutes per truck during periods of peak shipping. In addition, this project has increased cement storage capacity by over 60%. The process of converting our construction cement customers from Type 1, Type 2 cement to a less carbon-intensive Portland-limestone cement, also known as Type 1L is now complete at both our Midlothian and Hunter, Texas plants.We expect the Type 1L conversion to provide additional production capacity of 5% this year as compared to 2022 and helped reduce our carbon footprint. Our ready-mix concrete revenues increased 19.7% to $271.4 million and gross profit increased 142.3% to $35.4 million, driven primarily by strong pricing gains in the quarter, more than offsetting higher upstream raw material costs. Our asphalt and paving revenues increased 11.7% to $240.9 million and gross profit increased 37.9% to $36.5 million due to pricing improvement, coupled with lower bitumen costs as compared to the prior period. Magnesia Specialties revenues totaled $80.5 million in the second quarter, in line with the prior year quarter and gross profit increased 13% to $27.7 million.Notably, gross margin increased 440 basis points from the prior year quarter to 34.4%, driven by pricing growth and moderating energy expenses. As a general matter, energy costs are down from last year’s highs and have now seemingly stabilized. Non-energy costs continue to grow at rates well above historical averages and we expect that to continue throughout the rest of this year. That said, expected midyear price increases should serve to offset the expected cost inflation. During the quarter, we returned $116 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases. We repurchased nearly 178,000 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $422 per share in the second quarter. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned a total of $2.5 billion to shareholders through combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases.Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continued its downward trend and ended the quarter at 2.1x, within our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. This balance sheet strength gives us ample flexibility to continue investing in the business and pursuing accretive acquisition opportunities, while at the same time, extending our long record of returning capital to Martin Marietta’s shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back to Ward.Please also see 15 Republican Companies with Conservative Values and Most Popular Whiskey Brands in the World.Ward Nye: Thanks, Jim. With this year’s construction season well underway, we are confident in Martin Marietta’s bright prospects for the remainder of 2023. We continue to be encouraged by a number of factors that support sustainable demand for our products across the infrastructure and heavy non-residential construction sectors. As indicated in our supplemental materials, historic legislation, including the infrastructure investment in Jobs Act or IIJA, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act are expected to provide funding certainty for large infrastructure, manufacturing and energy projects for years to come. As such, we expect the related product demand for these key end-use segments to be largely insulated from any mild-to-moderate private sector contraction.We began with infrastructure, which accounted for 36% of our second quarter aggregate shipments. The value of state and local government, highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand, is again meaningfully higher year-over-year, with growth of 25% to a record $114 billion for the 12-month period ending May 31, 2023. Importantly, in addition to incoming IIJA funding, state legislatures are choosing to commit considerable investment to transportation projects. For example, Texas and North Carolina have directed portions of sales tax collections to infrastructure, while Florida is transferring general funds to augment State Department of Transportation resources. We expect this increase in public sector investment to drive sustained multiyear demand for our products in this important often countercyclical end market.Moving now to non-residential construction, which represented 35% of our second quarter aggregate shipments. As warehouse construction has moderated from its post-COVID peak, other heavy industrial projects led by onshore manufacturing and energy continued to drive demand in this segment, accounting for the majority of total non-residential shipments. Construction spending for manufacturing in the United States has accelerated to well above record levels as the MACE seasonally adjusted annual rate of spending for 2023 is $194 billion, a 76% increase from the May 2022 value of $110 billion. Since 2021, supported by enhanced federal investment from the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act, private companies have announced over $500 billion in commitments to invest in critical sectors like semiconductors and electronics, electric vehicle and related batteries and clean energy as those projects are both economic and national security consequence.Further, the nation’s aim to be the global leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning is expected to drive substantial demand for new data centers for the foreseeable future. As a result, we expect an extended cycle within the aggregates intensive heavy non-residential sector. We also remain optimistic about Martin Marietta’s light non-residential end markets, where we have yet to experience any notable weakness as shipments to in-process projects continue. We are actively monitoring this portion of the segment, but expect any possible future softness to be partially offset by the relative strength of the more aggregates intensive, heavy non-residential project pipeline. Moving to residential. Shipments to this segment accounted for 24% of total aggregate shipments this past quarter.Given the structural housing deficit in key Martin Marietta markets, we correctly anticipated that the affordability-driven residential slowdown would be short-lived. Accordingly, we are encouraged by recent public homebuilder sentiment and single-family starts data, which are indicative of a near-term bottoming and inflection point. The significant underbuilding over the last decade, coupled with existing homeowners reluctance to abandon their low rate mortgages, is exacerbating the housing deficit, thus available home inventory is being disproportionately driven by new home construction, a notable trend that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. To conclude, our record-setting second quarter performance provides outstanding momentum and a solid foundation for the balance of the year.As a result, we are confident in our ability to achieve our raised 2023 financial guidance. We believe our most recent results validate the secular durability of our proven aggregates-led business model and our team’s steadfast commitment to health and safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices and the execution of our SOAR 2025 initiatives will support our success. We remain focused on building and maintaining the safest, most resilient and best-performing aggregates-led public company. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"
271,9bba4198-2b24-367e-bab1-0e5a41823a41,ZBH,2023-07-29,CVS Health (CVS) to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cvs-health-cvs-report-q2-152900363.html,1690558140,STORY,"['CVS', 'ZBH']","[CVS Health Corporation CVS is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 2, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings of $2.20 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.28%. The company beat estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.52%.Let’s look at how things have shaped up for CVS Health prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCVS Health’s newly-formed Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment (includes all the company’s omnichannel pharmacy capabilities, legacy retail pharmacy, specialty and mail order pharmacy fulfillment and infusion services along with CVS Health’s front store offerings) is likely to have benefited from increased prescription and front store volume, similar to the first quarter of 2023. The company’s efforts to optimize the retail portfolio, which now consists of three models, including advanced primary care clinics, enhanced health hub locations and traditional CVS pharmacy locations, are likely to have aided second-quarter results.CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCVS Health Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCVS Health Corporation price-eps-surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuoteCVS Health has been making noteworthy progress in expanding access to care through digital and virtual channels. During the first quarter of 2023, CVS Health’s unique digital customers increased to more than 50 million. The company also interacted with nearly five million customers daily across the community footprint. The company also signed two additional renewable energy purchases that meaningfully advance its transition to 50% renewable energy by 2040. We expect these developments to have benefited the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues significantly.The company also launched a variety of new MinuteClinic virtual care services to support women's health that will be available 24/7.  CVS Health’s continued efforts to expand digital health services and deepen engagement through personalization are expected to have broadened its customer base in the second quarter, thus adding to its top line.Story continuesHowever, challenging market conditions and normalizing COVID trends might have dented growth within the segment in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Per our model, this segment is expected to report 9.1% year-over-year revenue growth this time around.The Health Services segment (includes most of the operations of the company’s legacy Pharmacy Services segment as well as its healthcare delivery operations) is expected to have recorded robust sales growth, banking on increased pharmacy sales and prescriptions filled, driven by demand for consumer health and cough, cold, and flu products. Also, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation is also likely to have contributed to the pharmacy services arm. We are also positive about the company’s newly developed comprehensive set of programs to manage specialty trends, which include a formulary exclusion strategy.Moreover, we also expect brand price inflation, new product launch, higher utilization and new PBM clients to have fueled growth in the second quarter. This is likely to have simplified and accelerated the process of filling prescriptions, thus benefiting business performance. However, continued client price improvements might have dented growth in the second quarter for this business.Our model projects this segment to report 4.1% year-over-year revenue growth.The Healthcare Benefits arm is likely to have been driven by sustained membership growth across all product lines. During the first quarter of 2023, medical membership increased by 1 million, reflecting improvement across the company’s individual exchange business. We expect this growth momentum to have continued. Further, CVS Health’s competitive cost structure, integrated benefit designs and innovative product portfolio are likely to have aided the growth of the healthcare benefits business.Our model projects this segment to report 13.4% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter.Key Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.12 per share implies an 11.7% fall from the year-ago reported figure.The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $86.74 billion, suggesting a 7.6% rise from the prior-year reported number.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a higher chance of beating estimates.

272,aeda282a-bc2c-3d44-8d69-50be574b4450,ZBH,2023-07-29,Henry Schein (HSIC) Set to Post Q2 Earnings: What Awaits?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/henry-schein-hsic-set-post-120900690.html,1690546140,STORY,"['HSIC', 'ZBH']","[Henry Schein, Inc. HSIC is set to release second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 7 before the opening bell.The company posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.21 in the last reported quarter, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.42%. Henry Schein beat earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, missed in one and was break-even in one quarter, the average surprise being 0.51%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Dental BusinessSimilar to the last reported quarter, HSIC’s dental distribution business is likely to have demonstrated underlying strength in end markets, backed by an aging global population, low unemployment levels and the growing global awareness of the healthcare benefits of preventative care and oral hygiene.On the equipment side, the company is likely to have delivered solid sales from traditional equipment, with North America expected to have benefited from price increases and growth in the parts and service business. Although we anticipate increased unit sales of intraoral scanners, the declining average selling price per unit is likely to have dented revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHenry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHenry Schein, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Henry Schein, Inc. QuoteInternationally, Europe is likely to have posted good sales growth in dental equipment, supported by the equipment backlog and parts and service business. On the last earnings call, Henry Scheinnoted that its global equipment order book, comprising mainly traditional equipment, remains robust and up year over year. This is expected to have significantly benefited the company’s top line in the second quarter.Within the Global Dental Specialty business, implant sales growth is likely to have been driven by the premium Camlog product line in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Further, North America is likely to have witnessed the increased trend of dental specialty practices being acquired by larger DSOs (Dental Service Organizations).Story continuesRecent highlights across the business include the acquisition of a majority stake in Biotech Dental, one of the largest providers of end-to-end dental solutions. In addition, HSIC has signed a definitive agreement to acquire S.I.N. Implant System, one of Brazil's leading manufacturers of dental implants, pending regulatory approval. Both these transactions are expected to boost Henry Schein’s BOLD+1 strategic plan, which focuses on advancing high-growth, high-margin businesses through organic and acquisition growth.In terms of the endodontic product offering, the company is likely to have seen growth in the second quarter, backed by Brasseler and Edge brands in North America. The positive development trend of HSIC’s Clear Aligner business, particularly with DSOs, is expected to have been sustained in the quarter under review.Our model projects global Dental business revenues for the second quarter of 2023 to be $1.94 billion, suggesting a year-over-year improvement of 4.6%.Medical Similar to the last quarter, HSIC’s underlying medical business is expected to have witnessed internal sales growth. However, the pace is likely to have been slower than last year, given the prior-year comparison resulting from significant growth.In May, the company announced the acquisition of Regional Health Care Group, a medical distributor serving the Australia and New Zealand region. The partnership will allow Henry Schein to leverage the countries’ infrastructure and expand its global medical product footprint.Meanwhile, lower sales of COVID-19 test kits and PPE products are likely to have persisted this quarter also, affecting the top line. Out of the specific product categories, pharmaceutical and equipment sales are likely to have been strong, while point-of-care diagnostic product sales are expected to have dropped to some extent in the second quarter.Per our model, projected global revenues from the Medical business for the second quarter of 2023 stand at $975.5 million, a decline of 2.1% from the prior-year reported figure.Technology and Value-Added Services The business is likely to have gained from the continued strength of the largest segment, Henry Schein One, which provides one of the broadest product offerings of dental practice management, and related software and services.Growth in North America is likely to have been driven by Dentrix and Dentrix Ascend cloud-based solutions and customers’ upgradation from the Easy Dental product to Dentrix Ascend. International growth is expected to have been supported entirely by cloud-based solutions for customers, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, where it was recently launched.On the last earnings call, management noted that the total number of customers for cloud-based solutions is up 30% over the last year. We anticipate HSIC to have demonstrated momentum within this part of the business in the second quarter also.Further, Henry Schein is likely to have witnessed growth in the revenue cycle management insurance claim product in the second quarter, driven by the number of e-claims reprocessed and enhanced functionality by electronic invoicing and reimbursement solutions.Toward the end of the first quarter, HSIC announced the full integration of Detect AI, powered by Video Health and Bola AI, into Dentrix Ascend. The initial customer uptake of this AI product offering has been well received and is likely to have aided the growth of the business.Our model projects global Technology and Value-Added Services business revenues for the second quarter of 2023 to be $192.2 million, suggesting a year-over-year improvement of 6.2%.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for HSIC’s second quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.11 billion. This suggests an increase of 2.7% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its second-quarter 2023 EPS of $1.25 indicates a year-over-year rise of 7.8%What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP, has a higher chance of beating estimates, which is the case here.Earnings ESP: Henry Schein has an Earnings ESP of +0.62%.

I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC’s Chair and Chief Executive Officer.Douglas Pferdehirt: Thank you, Matt. Good morning and good afternoon and thank you for participating in today’s earnings call. Our second quarter results reflect both strong operational performance and the achievement of several financial commitments. Subsea inbound orders were 4.1 billion in the period representing a book-to-bill of 2.5. We delivered strong sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin for both Subsea and Surface technologies, including a 420 basis point increase in Subsea to 14.4%, the highest quarterly margin since 2018. Free cash flow was 103 million in the quarter and just yesterday we provided two updates to our plans for shareholder distributions. With the first being the initiation of a quarterly dividend and the second announcing the doubling of our previous share buyback authorization to $800 million.Story continuesAlf will cover these updates in more detail. When taken together, these successes demonstrate that we are clearly focused on what we believe to be the most important drivers of shareholder value. Continuing with total company financial highlights in the quarter revenue was 2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was 254 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.9%, when excluding foreign exchange impacts. Total company inbound for the period was 4.4 billion. Total company backlog ended the period at 13.3 billion. Subsea backlog grew 29% sequentially to 12.1 billion, of which 81% will be converted into revenue beyond the current year. I would like to take a moment to highlight the quality of the inbound secured in the period. Subsea orders included six integrated projects, including the direct award of our largest iEPCI to date a contract from Equinor for the BM-C-33 development in Brazil year.Year-to-date, iEPCI has accounted for more than 50% of our order intake. We continue to expect iEPCI to achieve its highest ever inbound in 2023, enabled by a record level of iFEED activity that often converts to a direct award. Importantly, 70% of our orders are expected to come from a combination of iEPCI Subsea services and all other direct awards in the current year. In the second quarter, we continued to drive further adoption of our Subsea 2.0 configurable product platform. Equinor was the first to adopt the integrated project model and on the BM-C-33 project, they will be utilizing both iEPCI and Subsea 2.0. Also in the quarter, we were awarded our fifth consecutive contract by ExxonMobil in Guyana this time for the URO development, which will also utilize Subsea 2.0. And finally, last month we signed a 20-year framework agreement with Chevron, under which TechnipFMC plc will provide Subsea 2.0 production systems for gas field developments off Australia's Northwest Coast.As evidenced by the addition of three new adopters in the second quarter more and more clients are recognizing the benefits of our configured to order product portfolio which reduces engineering complexity, shortens lead times, and improves certainty and project execution. With a strong inbound success in the period, Subsea orders for the first half of the year totaled 6.7 billion, and today we are increasing our full-year outlook for 2023 Subsea orders to reach nine billion. The backdrop remains very strong. The feed pipeline continues to expand with more projects in advanced stages moving towards FID. Our Subsea opportunity list, which only extends out 24-months, remains robust with an opportunity set of more than 23 billion based on the midpoint value of these Subsea developments.And while these projects are typically available to the broader market, the strength of our outlook is predicated on our unique view into the offshore market. This is evidenced by the fact that over the last 10 quarters, only one-third of our inbound orders came from the opportunity list with the other two-thirds being the result of a proprietary set of project and service opportunities that are unique to our Company. And as anticipated, we have seen increased activity in Subsea services. In the quarter, we announced an award from Equinor Riserless Light Well Intervention services. This contract provides us with scope that extends out to 2025. It is also important to note that our order outlook assumes little to no benefit from new offshore frontiers.construction, drill, drilling, energy, equipment, exploration, fuel, gas, gasoline, holland, industrial, industry, maintenance, ocean, offshore, oil, petroleum, plant, platform, port, power, production, pump, refinery, rig, rotterdam, sea, sky, steel, technology, tower, wellCopyright: 1971yes / 123RF Stock PhotoAnd even without this optionality longer term visibility is improving. Our clients are securing capacity today for project inbound that extends execution all the way out to 2030. These are among the many tangible signs we see that support our view that this will likely prove to be a very extended market cycle. And even more importantly, it speaks to the level of confidence, our customers have in our ability to safely deliver their projects on time and on budget. In closing, we have strategically placed ourselves in a very differentiated position. More than 90% of our total company orders and revenue are generated outside the North America land market. We are fundamentally changing the way we operate our business to ensure that we create greater value for all stakeholders, and this is clearly being recognized by the market, given the continued adoption of iEPCI and Subsea 2.0. In fact, the quarter represented the highest level of inbound activity for both iEPCI and Subsea 2.0 in our Company's history.We look forward to sharing future milestones with you as we continue on our more ambitious journey ahead. I will now turn the call over to Alf discuss our financial results.Alf Melin: Thanks Doug. Revenue in the quarter was 2 billion. EBITDA was 254 million when excluding, foreign exchange loss. The impact of the previously disclosed legal settlement and restructuring and other charges. Operationally, we delivered strong sequential results. In Subsea revenue was 1.6 billion, up 17% from the first quarter. The increase was largely due to higher project activity in South America, the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Services revenue also increased when compared to the first quarter due to seasonal improvement, including higher installation and intervention activity. Adjusted EBITDA was 234 million with a margin of 14.4%, up 420 basis points from the first quarter. Results benefited from the higher revenue, improved margins in backlog and increased installation in services activity.In Surface Technologies revenue was 354 million, up 7% from the first quarter. Revenue increased primarily due to higher activity in the Middle East and North America. Adjusted EBITDA was 47 million a 16% sequential increase. Results benefited from higher revenue and improved operational performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.3%, up 110 basis points versus the first quarter. Turning to corporate and other items in the period. Corporate expense was 154 million excluding a non-recurring legal settlement charge, totaling 127 million corporate expense was 27 million. The non-recurring legal settlement charge in the period was related to the resolution of all outstanding matters with a French National Prosecutor's Office. As previously disclosed technique, TechnipFMC is responsible for 195 million of the legal settlement.The charge represented an increase to the existing provision to now reflect the value of the total liability. Net interest expense was 30 million and lastly, tax expense in the quarter was 43 million. Cashflow from operating activities was 156 million. Capital expenditures were 53 million. This resulted in free cash flow of 103 million in the quarter supported by solid customer collections. We ended the period with cash and cash equivalence of 585 million. Net debt was 844 million. During the quarter we repurchased 3.6 million shares for $50 million. Under the buyback program put in place one year ago we have repurchased a total of $200 million of stock at an average price of just below $12 per share. Moving to our guidance. For the third quarter, we expect Subsea revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin to be in line with the second quarter.For Surface Technologies, we expect revenue to be in line with the second quarter with the potential for modest improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin. For full-year 2023 we expect Subsea revenue to be modestly above the midpoint of the guidance range with adjusted EBITDA margin at the midpoint. For Surface Technologies, we now expect full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin to be modestly above the midpoint of the guidance range. For corporate expense we still expect to land at the midpoint of the range. When considering our revised outlook, we now anticipate the range of outcomes for full-year adjusted EBITDA to approximate 880 million when excluding foreign exchange. Lastly, there is no change to our free cash flow guidance of 225 million to 375 million for the current year.This includes a 27 million cash payment that was made in the third quarter as part of the legal settlement. The remaining portion owed will be paid in roughly equal installments over the first three quarters of 2024. Looking further ahead, our 2025 outlook calls for significant growth in EBITDA from current levels, which we expect will translate into strong growth in operating cash flow. Let me take a moment to discuss how we think about the allocation of that capital. First, there is the investment in our business. As we have stated before, we will maintain a disciplined approach to new investment. We have demonstrated for some time now that the strategic assets we own today can be managed and maintained in a capital efficient manner. We have established a long-term target for capital expenditures of 3.5% to 4.5% of revenue, and we continue to believe that the changes we have made to our operating model will allow us to remain at the low end of this range, even in the current period of growth.Now, I will focus on shareholder distributions. We believe that returning capital to our shareholders should be viewed as fundamental to any investment thesis for TechnipFMC. In 2022, we initiated a $400 million share repurchase authorization, and yesterday we added an additional 400 million doubling the authorization to a total of 800 million. As I stated earlier, we have completed $200 million of share repurchases under the authorization to date. Additionally, we delivered on our commitment to a dividend announcing a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share, which equates to a 1.1% annualized yield based on yesterday's close. When the dividend and buyback are taken together, we are committing to distributions that will exceed 60% of our annual free cash flow generation through at least 2025.We also expect shareholder distributions to grow in line with or better than the growth in total company EBITDA in 2024. While there is potential for the dividend to grow over time, our current expectation is that the majority of distributions will come from share buyback as evidenced by the significant expansion in the repurchase authorization. The final component of capital allocation relates to the balance sheet. We remain committed to achieving investment grade metrics and we are confident that our current financial plan can achieve that. The strength of our balance sheet today allows us to be more focused on capital investment and shareholder distributions. At the same time, we will retain the flexibility to reduce net debt. Importantly, this capital allocation framework is not aspirational, it is a commitment one that is supported by changes to our business and execution models, both of which are driving sustainable improvement in our financial performance.Operator, you may now open the line for questions.Operator: [Operator Instructions] David Anderson with Barclays.

The names on the list weren’t necessarily what you might think. While 2 of the “Magnificent 7” were on the list, that meant the others were not.The list reflected the last 23 years. That’s a long time to hold, and compound, a stock. Compounding is usually associated with value investors, like Warren Buffett, because it’s value investors which are normally long-term investors.But what about valuation? None of the Magnificent 7 are cheap.Should you buy a company at any price if you intend to hold it for a long time? Some on Twitter have argued that valuation is irrelevant. Look at Visa and Costco. Neither have been cheap but they have been good long-term performers.Does Valuation Matter in Long-Term Investing? 1.       Tractor Supply Co. (TSCO)Investors might be surprised to see Tractor Supply as the third best performer in the S&amp;P 500 since 2000. Since Jan 4, 2000 to July 24, 2023, Tractor Supply is up 18,980%.Earnings of Tractor Supply are expected to rise 7% in 2023 and 10% in 2024. You’re not getting the shares dirt cheap today, however, as it has a forward P/E of 20.5. And with that earnings growth, it has a PEG of 2.3.Should Tractor Supply still be on the value investor’s shortlist?2.       Ansys Inc. (ANSS)Ansys is a software company that specializes in engineering simulation. Ansys didn’t join the S&amp;P 500 until 2017 but it is now the 8th best performing S&amp;P 500 stock since 2000. From Jan 4, 2000 to July 24, 2023, Ansys is up 13,162%.Story continuesEarnings of Ansys are expected to rise 7.6% in 2023 and 11.6% in 2024. But you’ll pay a high price for those earnings as it has a forward P/E of 40 and a PEG ratio of 8.Is it too late for value investors to get into Ansys?3.       Visa Inc. (V)Visa did not make the S&amp;P 500 best performers list. It went IPO in 2008 and shares are up 1,363% during that time.Earnings of Visa are expected to jump 15.2% in fiscal 2023 and another 12.8% in fiscal 2024. Shares have always been expensive. At the IPO, it was trading at 40x and in 2021, when shares hit new highs, it was trading at 51x. But it’s gotten cheaper. Visa currently trades with a forward P/E of 27 and a PEG of 1.8.Should value investors keep an eye on Visa?4.       Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST)Costco didn’t make the S&amp;P 500 best performers list either, even though it’s a fan favorite both of shoppers and investors. Shares of Costco are up 1,052% from Jan 4, 2000 to July 24, 2023.Earnings of Costco are expected to rise 9.7% in fiscal 2023 and another 6.9% in fiscal 2024. But is that good enough? Costco is expensive, with a forward P/E of 39.2 and a PEG ratio of 4.7.For value investors, is it time to concede you will never own Costco?5.       Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG)Chipotle Mexican Grill also did not make the list of the top 10 best performing S&amp;P 500 stocks. It went IPO in Jan 2006 and promptly rose 100% on its first day of trading. Chipotle hasn’t been a cheap stock since. Shares of Chipotle are up 4,404% since the IPO.Earnings of Chipotle are expected to soar 34.5% in 2023 and rise another 20% in 2024. Shares have come down off recent all-time highs so it’s PEG ratio is just 1.3. That looks more attractive than its forward P/E, which is 42.7.If Chipotle shares weaken further, will value investors take a look?What Else Do You Need to Know About Long-Term Investing and Compounding?

MDLZ 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MDLZMondelez International, a leading player in the global snack industry, emerged as an independent organization following its split from the former Kraft Foods North American grocery business in October 2012. The company has a significant presence in the biscuit, chocolate, gum/candy, beverage, and cheese and grocery aisles. Its portfolio boasts well-known brands like Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Halls, and Cadbury.

The GF Value Line represents the stock's ideal fair trading value. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.At its current price of $75.95 per share, Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), with a market cap of $103.4 billion, appears to be fairly valued. Thus, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Evaluating the Fair Value of Mondelez International (MDLZ)Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy shares. Mondelez International has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.08, ranking worse than 81.59% of companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Mondelez International's financial strength as 5 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Story continuesEvaluating the Fair Value of Mondelez International (MDLZ)Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is less risky. Mondelez International has been profitable for 10 out of the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $32.9 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $2.87. Its operating margin is 12.43%, ranking better than 79.44% of companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. Overall, the profitability of Mondelez International is ranked 7 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.Growth is a crucial factor in the valuation of a company. The faster a company is growing, the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Mondelez International is 8.6%, ranking better than 57.64% of companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. However, the 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 0.2%, ranking worse than 60.66% of companies in the same industry.ROIC vs WACCReturn on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets.

The metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents per share. The year-over-year upside was mainly backed by solid operating gains and reduced shares outstanding. These were somewhat offset by increased interest expenses and taxes.Net revenues advanced 17% year over year to $8,507 million. The metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,194.2 million. The uptick was driven by strong organic net revenue growth of 15.8%, and increased sales from Clif Bar and Ricolino buyouts, somewhat negated by currency headwinds. Favorable pricing contributed to organic net revenues. We expected a year-over-year organic net revenue increase of 7.3%.Revenues from emerging markets increased 17.8% to $3,306 million, while rising 23.3% on an organic basis.

The adjusted operating income margin expanded 60 bps to 15.7% on increased net pricing, SG&amp;A leverage, reduced manufacturing costs stemming from productivity and favorable product mix.

Welcome to Ovintiv's 2023 Second Quarter Results Conference Call.As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that this conference call may not be recorded or rebroadcast without the expressed consent of Ovintiv. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jason Verhaest, from Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Verhaest.Jason VerhaestThanks, Michelle, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter '23 conference call. This call is being webcast and the slides are available on our website at ovintiv.com. Please take note of the advisory regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of our slides and in our disclosure documents filed on SEDAR and EDGAR. Following prepared remarks, we will be available to take your questions. Please limit your time to 1 question and 1 follow-up. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Brendan McCracken.Brendan Michael McCrackenGood morning. Thank you for joining us. Our outstanding second quarter results continue the strong momentum we've created with our focus on execution, and making better wells for lower costs. We exceeded every one of our guidance targets on the quarter. We also closed 2 compelling transactions that have simplified our portfolio, extended our premium inventory, enhanced our go-forward capital efficiency and expanded our margins. I'll speak more to the progress we're making with the newly acquired Permian assets in a moment, but first, I want to touch on our second quarter results.Our production outperformance in the quarter is coming from our legacy business. The accelerated close was included with our previously issued 2Q guidance. and the new assets have performed right in line with our expectations during the quarter. Quarter was a beat across the board from production to capital to per unit costs. We exceeded our targets delivered on both efficiencies and well productivity. Greg will cover this in more detail in a moment, but our oil production outperformance is the result of our completion design innovations and our capital reductions are the result of our execution efficiency gains. As a result, we've raised our full year production guidance and lowered our full year capital guide. Across the portfolio, the intense focus our teams have placed on operational execution continues to deliver results, especially in the Permian, where we posted another quarter of record operational efficiencies. Our Permian team has seamlessly integrated the new assets into our existing operations. We were pleased to close the transaction early and we have already finished resetting activity on the new acreage. We're currently at our expected run rate activity for the rest of the year with 5 rigs and 3 completion crews in the Permian. We're also already executing our proven drilling and completion designs on our new assets, and we fully expect -- we expect to have our first fully Ovintiv design wells online later in the fourth quarter.On second quarter production, we exceeded the top end of our guidance on oil, gas and NGLs were coming in below the low end of guidance for capital. These results were driven by strong well performance from each asset in our portfolio, successful base decline management on our older vintage wells. Tailwinds from lower natural gas royalty rates in the Montney and capital savings from continued record-setting operational performance across the asset base. We also returned approximately $172 million to our shareholders through share buybacks and our recently increased base dividend. I'll now turn the call over to Corey to cover our financial results.Story continuesCorey Douglas CodeThanks, Brendan, and good morning. In addition to the great operational results Brendan outlined, we also delivered strong financial results in the quarter with earnings per share of $1.34 and cash flow per share of $2.79, beating consensus estimates. We remain free cash flow positive despite the impact of transaction-related costs and the incremental capital associated with the early close of the Permian Basin acquisition. We also saw a strong per unit cost performance with operating expense, transportation and processing expense and production, mineral and other taxes coming in below the midpoint of guidance on a combined basis. Operating expense also benefited from a $23 million recovery of prior year's costs. We issued debt during the quarter to finance a portion of the Permian acquisition, and we are very pleased with our resulting capital structure and the maintenance of our investment grade rating and stable outlook from all 4 credit rating agencies.At quarter end, our leverage ratio was 1.7x, and this included all of the acquisition finance debt but only 19 days of EBITDA from the acquired assets. We remain committed to our mid-cycle leverage target of 1x or about $4 billion of total debt, assuming mid-cycle prices. The maturity profile of our recently issued bonds will allow us to optimize our debt paydown schedule as we work towards that target. While debt reduction is a big area of focus for us in the near term, our shareholder return framework has not changed. We will continue to distribute at least 50% of post-dividend free cash flow to our shareholders. with the remaining 50% going to the balance sheet. I would like to note that the amount of cash available for buybacks in our shareholder return framework is determined each quarter on a discrete basis. Yesterday, we provided our third quarter guidance and updated our 2023 full year guide to reflect the efficiencies, cost savings and improved well productivity we've seen year-to-date across the portfolio. In the third quarter, we expect to see total production average 540,000 to 560,000 BOE per day, with oil and condensate production of 202,000 to 208,000 barrels per day. We expect oil and condensate production to continue to grow through the fourth quarter and averaged 210,000 barrels per day in the second half of the year. This reflects the production momentum from the new Permian assets as we bring acquired WIPs online. The production profile will normalize by midyear 2024 with the second half 2024 oil and condensate production stabilizing at 200,000 barrels per day. We also raised our full year natural gas guide due to strong well performance across the portfolio. Third quarter capital spending will be the peak for the year at $840 million to $890 million. This reflects the shift from a 10-rig program in the Permian at the time the acquisition closed to our current 5 rig program. and the capital associated with the higher level of activity as we work to bring the acquired wells in progress online by year-end. We expect to bring online about 100 wells in the third quarter, with roughly half of these from the acquired Permian assets. We've updated our full year guidance with higher production and lower capital investment. The new guide incorporates the operational and capital efficiencies we've achieved our strong well productivity performance and the success we had in offsetting base production declines. In addition to increased capital efficiency, we also expect to see increased cash cost savings. We divested a relatively higher cost asset in the Bakken and added a relatively lower cost asset in the Permian. We anticipate company level savings of approximately 5% on a combined basis for OpEx and T&amp;P in the second half of the year. We also provided an update to our hedging positions with the materials yesterday with about 50% of our WTI exposure and about 40% of our NYMEX gas exposure hedged for the next 12 months. Capital efficiency is a key focus across the organization as efficiently converting our resource into cash flow is a crucial aspect of our durable returns approach, Livent's capital efficiency ranks top tier among our peers is creating exceptional value in today's volatile commodity and macroeconomic environment. In 2024, we expect to produce more than 200,000 barrels of oil in condensate per day for about $2.3 billion of CapEx at the midpoint. That's a 15% year-over-year capital efficiency improvement with an associated increase of 30,000 barrels per day of oil and condensate versus our original 2023 guide. This increase in capital efficiency generates higher returns on invested capital and allows us to deliver higher cash returns to our shareholders. When compared to our peers, Ovintiv's 2024 capital program will require about $250 million less capital to deliver the same production at the midpoint of our 2024 oil and condensate production and capital guides. I'll now turn the call over to Greg to cover our operational highlights.Gregory Dean GivensThanks, Corey. As Brendan noted, our top priority over the last 1.5 months has been the efficient and seamless integration of the new Permian assets into our existing operations. And the team has done a very impressive job. With 5 rigs and 3 frac spreads currently running across 180,000 acres in the play, we are already at our run rate activity for the rest of the year. Our results in the Permian year-to-date have been stellar, and we are very excited to unleash our proven development model on the acquired acreage. The wells on the new acreage are performing in line with average 2022 Midland Basin productivity rates, and we see opportunities to increase well performance and capital efficiency as we apply our drilling and completion approach to these assets. We have already begun deploying our proven optimization techniques on completion design, artificial lift and accelerated cycle times on the wells that were already in progress when the acquisition closed. We are also streamlining planning and logistics across our combined Permian position, improving efficiency versus the 3 separate operating companies that were previously planning and executing work on each of their individual footprints. We have already reduced offset frac hits as we've optimized our program across the combined position. As Brendan noted, we expect to see our first end-to-end Ovintiv designed wells online in the fourth quarter.Our efforts on completion design and particularly on stage architecture, continue to deliver leading well performance across our Permian acreage. The chart on the right shows the 2022 Midland Basin industry average compared to our 2023 type curve and the wells we brought online in the first half of the year. Our year-to-date oil performance is among the highest we've ever delivered in the Permian. It's important to note that the well outperformance is the result of the advances we've made to enhance completion design, including stage architecture, fluid chemistry and proppant loading. Our cube development approach has stayed consistent and our program well spacing is unchanged year-over-year. These results were spread out across our acreage footprint and our enhanced completions are being executed without an increase to completed well cost. As we are able to deploy our leading efficiencies into making better wells. While the recent well performance is outstanding, we're being thoughtful with our go-forward type curve assumptions. In the third quarter alone, we will bring on more than 50% more wells than we did in the entire first half of the year in the Permian. Once we see the results from these completions as well as the longer-term production from the previous wells, we'll have a much better handle on the repeatable uplift we can incorporate into our forecast. I'd like to take a quick moment to recognize the outstanding performance from our team in the Permian this quarter. Our operations continued to hit on all cylinders, setting new performance records while seamlessly integrating our newly acquired assets. These results are allowing us to deliver stronger well performance through completions optimization and improved stage architecture in a cost-effective manner. For example, our second quarter average completion speed at well over 3,500 feet per day is about 40% faster than our average speed over the last 3 years and 11% faster than our first quarter average. Using the same time frame comparison, we now pump 80% more proppant per day and 45% more fluid. Our enhanced performance is delivering better wells at lower cost, improving our capital efficiency. We continue to deliver impressive results across our portfolio, and our year-to-date performance in the Montney is no exception. Ovintiv wells continue to dominate the list of most productive wells in the play on a total BOE basis. Over the last 12 months, we have brought on the top 31 wells in the Montney and 36 of the top 50. I want to be clear that these impressive production rates do not come with a higher price tag. The average cost of the 36 wells highlighted in the chart was $4.5 million per well, making Montney wells the lowest cost in our portfolio. The great returns we generate in the play are further enhanced by our market diversification strategy, which we use to manage flow assurance and price risk. With almost all our Montney gas pricing outside of AECO, we realized 97% of NYMEX on a pre-hedge basis, and our condensate received 96% of WTI during the quarter. In the Uinta, we continue to deliver some of the strongest oil well results in North America. We recently brought on our 3-well Jorgensen pad in Duchene County with strong IP30 rates of 1,850 barrels of oil per day per well. Our large contiguous land base of approximately 130,000 net acres as multiple benches with about 1,000 feet of collective pay. It is 80% undeveloped, which translates into a significant inventory runway. As we previously noted, we recently secured additional rail capacity to the Gulf Coast, and we currently rail about 30% to 40% of our volumes there. This scalable option supports our future development plans for the play. Due to the highly oily nature of display in the first half of the year, the Uinta tied the Permian for the highest operating margin in our portfolio.Given the current gas and NGL markets, we have reduced our activity in the Anadarko Basin in the back half of the year. That said, the Anadarko is expected to be our top free cash flow generating asset in 2023 and remains a premier multiproduct option in our portfolio. The team continues to work the asset hard, cutting our base declines in half since 2021. They also wrapped up this year's activity on a high note, realizing a 25% increase in drilling feet per day in the quarter versus our 2022 average. I will now turn the call back to Brendan.Brendan Michael McCrackenThanks, Greg. And before we move to Q&amp;A, I'd like to sum up the key takeaways from today's call. I'd like to commend our team for the outstanding results year-to-date. Our focus on execution excellence has shown up across our portfolio. We have successfully integrated the new Permian assets, and our team is already applying our development model to the wells in progress. The asset performance has been strong, and we see opportunities for further gains going forward. We're increasing full year 2023 production guidance and lowering capital spending. We are one of the most capital efficient operators in the industry, and our 2024 program is advantaged compared to our peers in its ability to deliver more barrels for fewer dollars. We are committed to debt reduction while returning significant cash to our shareholders. Our shareholder returns framework remains unchanged and the amount available to shareholders will be determined by the same reliable approach every quarter. Over the long term, we believe that value creation in the E&amp;P space will come from companies that can durably generate both superior return on invested capital and return of cash to shareholders. we are well positioned to deliver on this value proposition with a deep premium inventory, leading capital efficiency to convert that inventory to free cash flow, and the disciplined capital allocation to make sure those returns flow through to the bottom line and to our shareholders.This concludes our prepared remarks. Michelle, we are now ready to open the line for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperatorThank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Arun Jayaram at JPMorgan.Arun JayaramBrendan, I was wondering if you could shed more insights on just the well productivity gains that you're seeing, particularly in the Permian -- Greg mentioned stage architecture, fluid and completion design, but I was wondering if you could give us more insights on that the potential repeatability. And I was also wondering if you've tested this in perhaps some areas outside of the core, and if you have any maybe preliminary results to share.Brendan Michael McCrackenYes, I appreciate the question and the pickup on the well performance. Obviously, really excited about what we're seeing there. And as we reported here today, we've now got 44 wells of the program online with production history and the performance is well above our 2023 type curve, which we're obviously enthused about. Really, the driver we're seeing here is the completion design piece that you mentioned. This has been a multiyear effort by our team to zero-in on the true causal factors that can drive well performance and increased recovery from shale. And it's not just in the Permian, we're deploying this across the whole portfolio. And really, I like to kind of break it down into 3 buckets, Arun, in terms of what the team has been driving on, and I probably won't do service to the detail and the multiple factors that are driving here, the 3 buckets we see really are the stage architecture, which is our phrase for the combination of cluster design, cluster spacing and then, of course, the sand and water loading that we're feeding in through those clusters. And the whole point of that stage architecture engineering is to get a more conductive fracture network more consistently placed along the entire lateral. And of course, that becomes even more important as we drill longer laterals in these plays and drive efficiencies that way. So that's the first bucket. The second bucket is kind of what we call chemistry, and that's using the chemistry of the frac fluid try and enhance the permeability of oil in that fracture network. And so then, as a consequence, get more recovery from the poor system in place. And then the final bucket is really got a few things in it, but really, it's this idea of real-time frac monitoring. And the approach here is traditionally in our industry the approach was the engineers in the office would write up a frac program and send it out to the field and then the field would pump it. And then sometime down the road, there would be a look back on and potentially optimization occur in subsequent wells. And what we're trying to -- the network we're trying to crack with technology and telemetry is to be able to do that real time. And the learning from the signals we're getting back subsurface well we're pumping and then tune our frac design as we go and as a consequence, just be more efficient with that frac design, but also get more recovery along that long lateral. So really, those are the 3 buckets I'd speak to Arun.Arun JayaramIt sounds like a nice endorsement of how a smart fleet technology, Jeff Miller. My follow-up, Brendan, is have you tested this kind of completion design outside of the core. And could there be any implications of, call it, Tier 2 locations on the map where you could boost the overall productivity to perhaps mimic Tier 1 type of economics?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes. And we -- I don't have the slide number off the top of my head here, but the slide that shows the Permian type curve performance also shows the math of where those 44 wells are across our land base. And what you can see from that is there's spread across the land base. So what that is telling us is this -- these completion designs are working across the Permian for us. And so as far as sort of the Tier 1, Tier 2 implications, really, what we're seeing is it's making the Tier 1 stuff better. And the good news story for our acreage position is we're pretty much in the core of the basin across the board. So we've really been just using it on the acres we've got, which are really all in that Tier 1 bucket. So -- but I think your point is valid, which is moving locations from near premium into that premium bucket is a win, and we look to do that all the time as well. One of the things we've talked about on the new acres is that 800 premium count underwrites 3-bench development across the acreage. And Greg pointed out, we've got quite a number of wells in progress that we'll be bringing on stream and those cubes are all either 3 or 4 bench cubes or even higher in some instances. So excited to see how those completion designs show up when we start to get them later this year.OperatorYour next question will come from Neal Dingmann at Truist Securities.Neal David DingmannBrandon, my first question is on your forward plan, which seems quite good. Specifically, you all talked about stable out your production, I believe. And I'm just wondering, would you kind of consider this kind of a maintenance plan? And if so, could you maybe speak to the -- around the level of CapEx needed to sustain this.Brendan Michael McCrackenYes, Neal, I appreciate it. Yes, we reiterated that 2024 view here today and obviously feel good about where that is sitting as we get further and further into the year here and now actually have control of the new assets, continuing to feel really good about that guide. The big movers are going to be how much deflation actually shows up. We think sitting here today with what we know about cost structure and activity levels that guide still makes total sense to us. So the implied midpoint of capital for '24 and then settling in at that 200,000 barrels a day in the second half, make total sense. The only thing I'd add to that in terms of maintenance is we continue to think that's the right way to prosecute this business. And we've talked about really 3 gates of decision-making to consider around capital allocation for either maintenance or modest growth. And really, in order to even think about modest growth, the 3 gates for us would be, first, it would have to be a better cash flow per share outcome than just buying our shares back. And so that's the first test. And then the second test would be does the world need more barrels and more BTUs. And then the third test would be what's the execution risk on adding that activity. And if I just quickly run through that model here, Today, the buyback still screen more favorably than adding rigs and spreads to the program. And then our judgment today is the world isn't asking for more barrels and BTUs from our company. And then the third gate there, certainly, that execution risk from a year-over-year perspective feels a lot better than it did last year when inflation was running pretty hard. So -- but still, those other 2 gates would have us staying in that maintenance mode.Neal David DingmannYes. Agree. All that makes sense. That's certainly to me as well. And my second question maybe for Greg, on the Permian. Specifically, can you address future potential maybe frac hits or needed well shut-ins. It seems to me kind of the plan you guys have talked about even now post deal, that you all have much more minimum level of shut-ins unlike a number of your various peers that are experiencing this.Gregory Dean GivensYes, Neil, thanks for the question. And you're exactly right. That was 1 of the value propositions we saw with the acquisition we just closed was you had 3 companies that were doing a good job but operating independently. And because of that, they weren't able to coordinate schedules and they were knocking off wells shortly after they were brought on. And what we've already seen, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks is that by using a coordinated approach across the entire 180,000-acre footprint we now have, we've already seen a reduction in frac hits, which allows us to get the full benefit of all the fracs that were out there pumping today, why not knocking these newer wells off. And we'll continue to optimize this as we go forward, but we do feel like that is a big part of the value we're going to be able to bring to this acreage by not having that be a problem. And some of these new completion designs also seem to be helping on that front as well.Neal David DingmannNo. Great to hear. Thanks, Greg. Thanks, Brandon.OperatorYour next question will come from Gabe Daoud at TD Cowen.Gabriel J. DaoudMaybe just back to the Permian outperformance. Greg, could you maybe just comment on what exactly you need to see here or how much time and data do you need to collect to start factoring in as our performance on -- or in your go-forward guidance. I guess it would depend on what some of these new cubes look like on the new acreage. But curious to hear your thoughts on that. And then could you also just comment on where pro forma Permian production is today. I think at the time of the deal, you pointed to 125,000 barrels a day of oil and conde combined. So just curious if that's more or less where you're at there.Gregory Dean GivensYes. So as far as the forecasting goes, as I mentioned, a lot of activity going on in the play today. We're very pleased with what we saw in the first half and those wells continue to hold up. But we're going to be bringing on a lot more wells in the back half of the year. We're going to want to see how that productivity holds up in keeping in mind a number of the wells, over half the wells we're bringing online in the third quarter are going to be wells that -- while we're influencing the tail end of the completion, we were not involved in those wells from their inception to bringing them online. So we do believe there's a little uncertainty there. We want to see how those wells do. We're quickly incorporating all of our completion techniques into our operations. So you're going to see, as we go through the third and into the fourth quarter, a whole lot of data coming in, and we're trying to be thoughtful about how we approach this -- so by later this year, we should have a much better sense of how well this uplift, not only is impacting our existing legacy portfolio, but the new wells and then how long it's not just the number of wells that we need to see is the duration, how long this production uplift holds up. So we're looking forward to seeing that. And then as we continue to see that more consistently, we'll start baking that into our forecast.Brendan Michael McCrackenYes, Gabe, I think you had a question on the pro forma there, too. So yes, as Greg picked up earlier, we got about 60 to 70 Permian wells to bring on in the quarter. So it's a fairly dynamic number, any given day here. But you're right, we're running just a little over that 120,000 barrel a day at the moment.Gabriel J. DaoudGot it. Got it. Okay. Cool. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the cost side, you highlighted some of the efficiencies driving savings and you have that $2.1 billion, $2.5 billion range out there for '24. But curious, I guess, what's embedded in that $2.1 billion. I guess, efficiencies continue to hold, could that number trend towards $2.1 billion? Or is there a little bit of expectations around some cost deflation continuing? Just curious if you could maybe talk a little bit more about what we need to see for that $2.1 billion number.Brendan Michael McCrackenYes, Gabe, I appreciate it. I think the service cost environment is probably the bigger driver of the range there as we see it sitting here today. And again, we've we're telling the market here is that midpoint of the range feels like the right steering point with what we know. And we'll just have to see where service prices trend. We've seen rig counts come off on both the gas and the oil side by about 15% from the peaks. And -- if that continues, then that will keep driving further deflation and that could push us lower in the range. And we'll just have to see, obviously, oil has ticked up a little bit, and gas has maybe been a bit stronger through the summer months. So we'll see what that translates through to activities by the rest of industry. We've been clear about we're not adding activity, but we'll see what happens across the rest of industry and tune our '24 guide as we get closer to it.OperatorYour next question will come from Joshua Silverstein at UBS. .Joshua Ian SilversteinYes. just thinking about the shareholder return profile versus the debt reduction you mentioned kind of up to 50% for the balance sheet portion of it. If go basically just have enough cash on hand to pay down the '25 and '26 maturities as they come up? Or do you actually want to build a little bit more cash than that to be opportunistic for other bolt-ons or anything else?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes. I think, Josh, there what we'll do is we'll follow the program here, which calls for the at least 50% to incremental shareholder return over and above the base dividend. And then the rest will be available for that debt reduction, which is we're trying to take the debt down to 4. And so I think we'll be very opportunistic to do that as we go along. And think we were thoughtful about the capital structure to enable that without extra cost. And so like you said, we've got some well-timed maturities in the next couple of years to be able to do that.Joshua Ian SilversteinGot it. And then I mean you guys do have a second (inaudible) into now, it seems like you have a pretty good well performance there. I was curious on the rail infrastructure that you guys had mentioned. Is this supporting potential basin growth for you guys, an increased capital allocation? Or is it really just more economic?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes. No, I appreciate it. Yes, we're excited about what we're seeing in the Uinta. And remember, the last 2 years, what we've worked hard to do is demonstrate well performance at cube development spacing and then unlock that market access to the Gulf Coast. And so we made great progress on both those fronts. We're now railing to the Gulf, some 30% to 40% of our total into volumes. And with the 2 rigs running there, we're going to see a big production ramp in the Uinta through the back half of the year. So that rail infrastructure is low cost and scalable. And so that will afford us to be able to have higher Uinta production volumes through the back part of this year and into 2024, depending on how we set capital in '24.OperatorYour next question will come from Doug Leggate at Bank of America.Unidentified AnalystThis is John Ivan on for Doug Wagon. Our questions really are on the Anadarko Basin. First of all, with the reduction of activity, what would you have to see in terms of prices to bring activity back there to that base?Brendan Michael McCrackenOn the Anadarko, really, our team has done just an incredible job here. The focus on innovation has resulted in a substantial shallowing of our base decline to 20%. And that creates a ton of value for us means that it's set to be our highest free cash flow generator in the portfolio. And the recent wells that the team had brought on stream in the first half of the year have been really strong performers. I mentioned earlier, we've been using the same completion design optimizations in the other assets as the Permian, and that's the same here in the Anadarko. So we're encouraged by the underlying asset performance. And -- but really with the gas and NGL fundamentals that we saw coming into the second half of the year is really why we chose to rotate capital out of there for the time being. And so with the stronger gas and NGL fundamental into '24, particularly later in '24 once we see the start-up of some incremental LNG pull off the Gulf Coast, that could be the signal that brings capital back into the Anadarko brings the rigs back there. So I think we'll just watch for it. I'm not sure there's a specific price toggle one way or the other because it's always going to depend a little bit on cost structure as well. And the team has been really working hard on initiatives to reduce D&amp;C costs and increased cycle times in the Anadarko as well. So I think it's a little bit of a combination of those things, but for the big things we want to see a more healthy supply and demand balance on the gas side and the NGL side.Unidentified AnalystThat's very helpful. And just as a quick follow-up on the Anadarko. Just given the improvements in the underlying declines and productivity that you're seeing. How long do you think you can actually do that for in terms of holding? How many years of inventory, how long do you think you can actually hold that flat potentially if you wanted to?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes. So the Anadarko, the fantastic piece there is we've got a deep, high-quality inventory in that play as well. And really, we see over a decade of drilling inventory to hold that asset flat should we choose to allocate the capital there to do that.OperatorYour next question will come from Umang Choudhary at Goldman Sachs.Umang ChoudharyMy questions. I appreciate all the color on the strong performance in the Permian and the Montney. And I understand that there's less clarity in terms of how the 3Q performance will shape up in the Permian in the acquired assets. Can you remind us on the cadence of activity in the back half of this year, especially in the Permian I'm trying to pare the improved performance, which you've seen recently in your legacy assets and the implication to your production guidance next year.Brendan Michael McCrackenYes, I appreciate it. Yes, cadence wise, a lot going on in the Permian here in the back half of the year. So we're going to see between 60 and 70 TILs in the third quarter and just a little bit less than that in the fourth quarter, but rate up there as well. So that's the setup through the back half of the year on cadence, which is going to see us at a total company level, averaged 210,000 barrels a day of crude and conde in the back half of the year, and then some of that will spill into early '24 and then we'd expect to level back out at that 200,000 barrels a day by midyear and hold that flat through the back half. So that's the cadence set up there.Umang ChoudharyGot you. That's really helpful. And then my next question was on risk management. As you mentioned earlier, you added some leverage here with the transaction. Any updated thoughts around the level of hedges -- hedging you want to do to protect yourself from commodity price risk next year?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes. I appreciate the question there. So on hedging, really what we've done here is continue to use our next 12-month approach. So building the book out 1 quarter at a time over the next 12 months. And we've also continued to use 3-way structures to provide a soft floor that we're comfortable with but also give some upside to higher price exposure, which, of course, would enable us to participate in a structurally stronger market. So in the second quarter here, we did add some second quarter hedges on the gas side. And so over that next 12-month period, we're about half hedged on oil and about 40% hedged on gas, again, primarily in those 3 wave structures. And I'm sure you saw it, but Slide 20 has got the details of that, but that's generally the approach we've been taking. I think as we continue to drive debt down, we'll drive that hedging level down from that sort of 50% and 40% down back towards that more quarter to 1/3 of production level.OperatorYour next question will come from Phillips Johnston at Capital One.Unidentified AnalystIn addition to the uplift in productivity that you're seeing in this year's vintage of wells in the legacy Menlo properties. In the slide deck, you also mentioned older wells are outperforming forecast. Just wondering what kind of magnitude you might be talking about there, what you would trim that to? And which areas you're seeing the biggest upside?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes, Phil awesome pick up. Appreciate the catch on that. And Obviously, that's one of the most efficient ways to add production is by optimizing base. And so kind of the contributing factors here, and Greg might have some fill-ins, but it's been what we've been doing on artificial lift. And then also some really inexpensive workover treatments that have been creating some boosts in our older vintage wells that we're excited about. So I don't know, Greg, if you want to add anything there?Gregory Dean GivensYes. It's really just a lot of great work by the teams, blocking and tackling, reducing failure frequency. But we do see a little improvement with some of the new frac designs we're pumping seem to have less impact on the parent wells. But really, just a lot of things that the teams are looking at that are adding up to a nice little beat there on the base side. And this is something we're focused on in all of the areas, not just the Permian.Unidentified AnalystOkay. And I'm guessing that's also not factored into your second half of the year production guidance or the '24 guidance, correct?Brendan Michael McCrackenWell, I think what we've factored in here now is the performance uptick we've seen on the existing PDP. And so where the upside is still just what further decline abatement can we do, but we have included the PDP impacts that we're realizing today in the forward guide.Unidentified AnalystOkay. That makes sense. And then just maybe an update on LNG Canada Phase I. I realize you guys aren't a direct participant, but it's obviously going to help pricing in the bid. I think as of the Montney Day in September, I think the project was over 60% complete with timing in first quarter '25. Just wondering how the progress has been since then.Brendan Michael McCrackenYes. I'll get Corey to chime in because there have been some recent progress updates from the operators there, both on the pipe side and the LNG liquefaction side, and he might remember the percentages, they're actually pretty high in terms of percent complete here now. But what I'd say about LNG generally is we continue to evaluate and are engaged in all of the West Coast LNG projects that are either under construction like Phase I or pre-FID like several others. We do think it makes sense to have some exposure to LNG for our portfolio over time. We think that's complementary to our existing price diversification strategy in the Montney. Couple kind of ground rules, if you will. I think, one, we're not interested in an equity stake. So I think we can take that off the board. But we've shown we can demonstrate great success by developing egress out of the Montney and into the rest of North America. And I think the logical extension of that is also to have a piece of global exposure here. And so our team is hard at work across each of those projects to find the right commercial solution for us. But I don't know, Corey, if you've got any of those project update numbers of top of your head there.Corey Douglas CodeYes, sure, Brendan. So Shell talked about this a little bit yesterday, but I think they're reference point, certainly sounds more optimistic than it had in the past, even they're talking about 75% complete on the midstream and more than 90% complete on the pipeline. So Obviously, that's coming soon and good updates from that standpoint.Unidentified AnalystOkay. That sounds good Thanks.OperatorYour next question comes from Jeffrey Lambujon at TPA Genco.Jeoffrey Restituto LambujonMy first one is another one on how you're looking at forecasting for next year. If we get to a situation where the current forecast for the Permian particular prove conservative for 2024 with maybe the same CapEx range you've been talking about actually able to generate more production than what's modeled today. How should we think about the overall outlook potentially changing. So I just want to get a sense for if we should think about reductions to that spending range, maybe with less capital, again, needed to still achieve greater than the 200 level on Cubicos you've spoken to or if it might be more like a steady range on CapEx, but with the potential for volumes sold closer to what we might see in Q4 here for a bit longer?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes, Jeff, I appreciate the question, and I love your take on it. I think what we'll do, as we set '24 is we'll run those 3 gates on where does it make sense from a cash flow per share impact, what's the world asking for in terms of barrels and BTUs. And then what do we see as the execution risk? And sitting here today, I think that maintenance level continues to feel like the right answer to those. But obviously, we'll get a chance to look at that through the back half of the year. But that will be our starting point, on that decision. And then the other piece that we'll factor into it is just the level loading. We've worked really hard to create a level-loaded program this year. We think that's benefiting our teams greatly. And so we want to be preserving that as we kind of go forward into 2024 and setting up for a consistent level loaded program across the assets full year '24. So those will be the things that we weigh as we work our way through this, and then we'll be looking to optimize the returns, both return on invested capital and the return of cash to shareholders.Jeoffrey Restituto LambujonOkay. Great. And then my second one is just a follow-up on the Uinta, just given we're about to see some additional contribution from that asset here in the second half, as you alluded to. I wanted to just ask simply what you need to see to allocate more capital there. I know you've been talking about the productivity comparisons. You spoke to the infrastructure earlier, kind of making room for that, if that's ultimately where you decide to go. And I think you've spoken to some depth on the cost side of the equation in the past, but just wanted to get a refresh there on how you're thinking about competitiveness of that asset just going into next year versus the balance of the portfolio?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes, you bet. And so right now, the program we've got through the rest of '23 here is absolutely return competitive with the rest of our portfolio. It sits right there on the on the same level of returns that we're seeing in the other assets. So that's important, first of all, because otherwise, we wouldn't put capital there. And then as far as trajectory from here, I think 2 rigs is going to really see a big ramp in volumes there. So that feels like the right level to be thinking about as we head into 2024, and we'll just kind of watch and see the performance as we go through the year.OperatorAt this time, we have completed the question-and-answer session, and I will turn the call back to Mr. Verhaest.Actually, I do apologize. We have 1 question left in the queue from Scott Gruber at Citigroup. Mr. Gruber.Scott Andrew GruberJust a couple of follow-up questions. What level of overall cost inflation would align with the midpoint of the '24 guide just kind of ballpark.Brendan Michael McCrackenYes. Scott, yes, glad we got you there, I apologize for any confusion. Yes, so really, that midpoint of that guidance range would be sort of the deflation trajectory that we're seeing currently. So as we've kind of reviewed service pricing. Most recently, we've seen a little bit of reductions on some of the cost categories like diesel and steel. We've seen the green shoots of reductions on other categories like rigs and spreads. And so is basically including what we see today. And like I said, we'll have to watch and see how things unfold if more deflation materializes as we go through the back half of the year.Scott Andrew GruberOkay. Any way to quantify that? Is it kind of a mid-single-digit type number? Is it trending towards double-digit.Brendan Michael McCrackenI think, yes, in -- so the numbers we're seeing are low single digit. And the only thing I'd say about that, of course, is it depends on your starting point for what I've seen other E&amp;P comment on different numbers and it always just has to be rooted in what you're starting from. And we had a number of fairly favorable service pricing arrangements in '24 here -- in '23 here. So what we're seeing is kind of low single digits relative to that.Scott Andrew GruberOkay. I appreciate the color.OperatorMy apologies again. At this time, we have concluded the question-and-answer session, and I will turn the call back to Mr. Verhaest.Jason VerhaestThanks, Michelle, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our call is now complete.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference call for this morning. We would like to thank everyone for participating and ask you to please disconnect your lines.]"

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative surprise of 16.15%.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.Factors to ConsiderOccidental’s second-quarter production volume is expected to be the lowest of the year due to the timing of its domestic onshore activity and the optimization of its maintenance schedule to reduce planned downtime in the Gulf of Mexico. Second-quarter domestic operating cost is expected to increase due to ongoing maintenance work.During the second quarter, the contribution of oil to total production will be lower compared with the historical quarter due to a lower contribution from the Gulf of Mexico and Algerian assets. The drop in commodity prices might have impacted earnings.Occidental’s second-quarter earnings are expected to have benefited from the ongoing share repurchases. Repayment of outstanding debts might have also reduced capital servicing costs and boosted margins.ExpectationsOccidental expects second-quarter total production of 1,156-1,196 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d) and 558-578 MBOE/d output from Permian Resources.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter crude oil production is pegged at 616 thousand barrels of oil per day. For natural gas, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 1,770 thousand cubic feet per day.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share and total revenues is pinned at 70 cents per share and $7.54 billion, respectively, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 77.8% and 36.7%, respectively.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Occidental this time around.

284,cc14c2e4-3c79-3272-85de-951a76d71e2b,OXY,2023-07-29,Is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) Using Too Much Debt?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-nyse-oxy-using-120039898.html,1690545639,STORY,['OXY'],"[Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum How Much Debt Does Occidental Petroleum Carry?As you can see below, Occidental Petroleum had US$19.1b of debt at March 2023, down from US$26.3b a year prior. However, it does have US$1.17b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$17.9b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Occidental Petroleum's Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Occidental Petroleum had liabilities of US$6.73b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$34.6b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$1.17b in cash and US$3.27b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$36.9b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.This is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$56.0b. This suggests shareholders would be heavily diluted if the company needed to shore up its balance sheet in a hurry.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Occidental Petroleum's net debt is only 0.92 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 21.5 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. On top of that, Occidental Petroleum grew its EBIT by 71% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Occidental Petroleum's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the last two years, Occidental Petroleum actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. There's nothing better than incoming cash when it comes to staying in your lenders' good graces.Our ViewHappily, Occidental Petroleum's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its level of total liabilities. Zooming out, Occidental Petroleum seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Lauren Tengler: Thank you, Kyle. Welcome everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2023 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations on the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials &amp; Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q1 performance as well as the outlook for our business including Q2 and full year 2023 guidance.And then, we'll take your questions. During today's Q&amp;A session Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions and divestitures excluded for organic growth or Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022. The majority stake investment in Acotec Scientific Holdings Limited and Apollo Endosurgery, which closed in February and April of this year, respectively. Divestitures include the endoscopy pathology business, which closed April of this year.Story continuesPlease note that, we have elected to consolidate Acotec results on a one quarter lag, which had an immaterial impact on our Q2 reported and adjusted results. On June 15, 2022, we announced our entry into a definitive agreement to purchase a majority stake in M.I. Tech, the agreement required global regulatory approvals that we were unable to obtain in some countries. As a result, the original agreement was terminated and in June of this year, we purchased a minority stake in M.I. Tech.

At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike?Mike Mahoney: Thanks, Lauren, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. We're very proud of our second quarter results, which exceeded our expectations and demonstrated the strength of our category leadership strategy, commitment to clinical evidence, and the winning spirit of our global team. In second quarter '23, total company sales grew 12%, both operationally and organically versus second quarter '22, exceeding the high end of our organic guidance range of 7% to 9%. We anticipate that most of our business units grew in line or faster than the respective markets, fueled by our innovative portfolio and commercial execution, also supported by healthy procedure demand. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.53 grew 21% versus second quarter '22, exceeding the high end of the guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50.And second quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.8%, also slightly higher than anticipated. Through the first half of the year, we have grown their business organic sales rate at 13%, with broad-based durable growth across all of our business units and regions. Importantly, we have also grown our adjusted EPS growth 20% during the first half, while balancing our investments to ensure we achieve our short-term and long-term goals. Now for our 2023 guidance, we're guiding the third quarter '23 organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% and we expect momentum to continue and are raising our full year organic guidance to 10% to 11%. Our third quarter adjusted EPS estimate is $0.46 to $0.48 and we're increasing our full year adjusted EPS range to $1.96 to $2.I'll now provide some additional highlights in the second quarter, along with comments on our '23 outlook, and Dan will provide more details on the financials. Regionally, and on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 9% in second quarter, with notable strength in our WATCHMAN, PI and Endoscopy businesses. Europe, Middle East Africa also grew 9% on an operational basis versus second quarter, with strong performance in the region was broad-based, with double-digit growth in four out of our five major markets in Europe. Across the portfolio, we saw strength in new and ongoing product launches, including FARAPULSE, POLARx, ACURATE neo2 and LUX-DX. Asia Pacific grew 24% operationally versus second quarter, led by strength in China and Japan. Japan growth is fueled by new products, including agent, our drug-coated balloon for the coronary arteries, and resume our minimally invasive BPH technology with device performance and procedures that leave nothing behind is resonating in the market.China delivered excellent growth in the second quarter, led by our innovative portfolio and commercial execution against the COVID impact second quarter '22. We also saw particular strength in our interventional cardiology therapies, WATCHMAN, CRM and PI business units and we continue to expect double-digit growth in China for the full year. I'll now provide some additional commentary on our businesses. Starting with urology. Urology sales grew 8% organically in the second quarter. The stone management franchise grew double-digits, driven by LithoVue and ongoing globalization efforts. Rezum continues to do well globally, growing strong double-digits in the quarter and most recently launching in Brazil. We continue to see ongoing momentum within our prosthetic urology franchise, fueled by patient activation efforts.designed to bring awareness to our erectile restoration and male incontinence interventions. Endoscopy sales were excellent, growing 12% organically and 14% operationally in the second quarter, with notable strength in the U.S., Latin America and Asia-Pac, with new product momentum and healthy procedure demand. Our Apollo integration is progressing well and earlier this month that we received FDA clearance for OverStitch NXT, a suturing system that enables suture placement during advanced endoscopic procedures. This next-generation device brings ease-of-use benefits and improved accessibility when using a single-channel endoscope. Neuromodulation sales grew 3% organically in the second quarter. Spinal cord stimulation sales were flat versus prior year and we expect SCS sales growth to improve in the second half of the year, with strong trialing in the second quarter in support of clinical evidence, which was presented this month at Aspen.Notably, six-month outcome data were reported from the SOLIS trial, which is a randomized controlled trial for non-surgical back pain, which demonstrated superior outcomes for SCS against conventional medical management, also consistent with primary endpoint results. Our brain franchise grew double-digits in the quarter, with continued momentum from new product launches in the U.S. and procedure recovery in Europe. Earlier this month, we received FDA approval for the Vercise Neural Navigator 5 software, which when used with our deep brain stimulation system can help provide clinicians with data for efficient programming in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Peripheral Interventions sales were very strong growing 13% organically versus second quarter '22.Our arterial franchise grew double-digits, led by our drug eluting portfolio. And earlier this month, after reviewing all available data and analysis, the FDA provided updated information associated with paclitaxel-coated devices used to treat PAD, recognizing the safety of these devices and eliminating the requirement for specific warning language within device-related labeling. We're pleased that the FDA determined that the available data do not support an excess mortality risk and we remain dedicated to helping physicians provide the best care possible for their patients. In Venous, U.S. growth was led by ongoing strength in Varithena, a non-thermal treatment for varicose veins, with international growth driven by our clot management technologies.Healthcare biology microscope, lab laboratoryPressmaster/Shutterstock.comOur Interventional Oncology franchise grew double-digits with strength across the entire portfolio. And last month, we received clearance for the EMBOLD, Soft and Packing Coils, which along with the EMBOLD fibroid coil, complete our detachable coil system. We also began our limited market release for Obsidio, which is the only conformable gel embolic material that's indicated for the peripheral vasculature, adding to our robust embolization portfolio. Cardiology delivered another excellent quarter with organic sales growth of 13% versus second quarter. Within cardiology, the Interventional Cardiology Therapies business, sales grew 12% organically versus second quarter. Our coronary therapies franchise growth was driven by our innovative imaging technologies as well as the recent launch of our agent drug-coated balloon in Japan, offsetting ongoing price pressure in drug eluting stents.Our structural heart valves franchise grew strong double-digits with another quarter of performance from our ACURATE neo2 in Europe. Market reception remains very high, backed by clinical evidence, ease-of-use benefits and a focus on lifetime patient management. We continue to expect to bring ACURATE neo2 to the U.S. in the second half of 2024. WATCHMAN sales grew 27% organically versus second quarter, also outpacing the market. U.S. demand remains strong and international growth was led by China and Japan. We were pleased to have completed enrollment in the WATCHMAN FLX Pro CT pilot study, which is a single study design using multiple imaging modalities to assess post-procedural healing in the next generation of WATCHMAN FLX Pro. We expect continued momentum within the WATCHMAN franchise further supported by the anticipated approval of our both WATCHMAN FLX Pro and our steerable sheath called Trusteer (ph) by the end of 2023.Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 5% organically in the quarter. In core CRM, our high-voltage business grew low-single digits and our low-voltage business grew mid-single digits, and we believe that performance was in line or slightly below market growth as the replacement tailwinds neutralize. Our diagnostic franchise grew double-digits in the quarter on the strength of our broad cardiac diagnostic portfolio and we anticipate momentum will continue, supported by the approval of our next-generation ICM called LUX 2 expected later this year. Electrophysiology sales grew 28% organically in the second quarter. International growth continues to be fueled by strong performance in both FARAPULSE and POLARx across Europe and Asia-Pac. We continue to make progress towards bringing these innovative technologies to the U.S., and we expect POLARx approval in the third quarter.In addition, we are looking forward to the data presentation of the ADVENT trial, our U.S. IDE, at the ESC Conference on August 27. Recall the ADVENT trial is a first of its kind, randomized clinical trial, designed for a non-inferior 12-month primary safety and efficacy endpoints compared to a commercially available RF and cryoablation systems. It is notable for its design and rigor as it seeks to demonstrate the single procedure effectiveness of an intervention without the use of antiarrhythmic drugs and reablations. We continue to anticipate the approval of FARAPULSE in the U.S. in 2024. The Access Solutions franchise grew strong double-digits in the second quarter with continued momentum in the U.S. and Japan with a differentiated VersaCross Transseptal platform.We're also proud of the performance of our global teams and are confident in our future. We remain committed to sustainable innovation and our financial goals, consistently growing sales faster than our underlying markets, expanding operating margins and delivered strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth with a strong adjusted free cash flow generation. We're looking forward to our September 20 Investor Day, where our leadership team will provide more insight into our innovative pipeline today, the opportunities ahead and our long-term financial goals. So before I pass it along to Dan, I want to announce that we also have some movement within our business unit leadership team. And after nearly 20 years at Boston Scientific, Maulik Nanavaty has announced his plan to retire in August.Jim Cassidy will now lead the neuromodulation business, where he previously spent eight years prior before moving over to lead the WATCHMAN franchise five years ago. Lastly, Angelo DeRosa will now lead our WATCHMAN business. Angelo has spent the last 10 years of Boston Scientific in Europe, most recently leading the European CRM and EP business. Congratulations to Jim and Angelo and we appreciate Maulik for his many contributions to Neuromodulation in Boston Scientific throughout his career. With that, I'll pass it over to Dan to provide more details on the financials.Dan Brennan: Thanks, Mike. Second quarter 2023 consolidated revenue of $3.599 billion represents 11% reported revenue growth versus the second quarter of 2022 and reflects a 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, in line with expectations. Excluding this $33 million headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 12% in the quarter. Sales from acquisitions and divestitures contributed 30 basis points, resulting in 11.6% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of 7% to 9%. Q2 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $0.53 grew 20.7% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50, driven by strong sales performance and a favorable effective tax rate in the quarter. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 72%, slightly ahead of our expectations, resulting in an adjusted gross margin of 71.2% for the first half of 2023.We continue to expect second half gross margin to be lower than the first half of 2023 and in line with the second half of 2022, largely due to timing of foreign exchange movements in 2022. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.8%, slightly ahead of expectations, predominantly driven by strong top line performance and partially offset by slightly higher SG&amp;A spend. We continue to focus on adjusted operating margin expansion and are maintaining our full year 2023 goal of approximately 26.4% adjusted operating margin, which would represent 80 basis points of improvement versus the full year 2022. On a GAAP basis, the second quarter operating margin was 14.3%. Moving to below the line, second quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $93 million, slightly higher than expectations, driven by FX volatility in certain unhedged currencies.On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the second quarter was 9.8%, slightly below expectations due to certain discrete tax items and a lower than anticipated operational tax rate of 13.2%, driven by our geographic mix of earnings in the quarter. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,456 million shares in Q2, which includes the issuance of 23.98 million common shares upon the conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock on June 1 of this year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $514 million, with $658 million from operating activities, less $143 million net capital expenditures. Excluding special items, adjusted free cash flow was $730 million. We continue to target full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2.3 billion.As of June 30, 2023, we had cash on hand of $426 million and our leverage was 2.4 times, in line with our expectations. I'll now walk through guidance for Q3 and the full year. We expect full year 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 11% to 12%, which excludes an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect full year 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 10% to 11% versus 2022. We expect third quarter 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 10% versus Q3 2022, excluding an approximate 50 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange based on current rates. Excluding the contribution from closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect third quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9%.We continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $340 million. We continue to expect our full year 2023 operational tax rate to be approximately 14%. Under current legislation and forecasted geographic mix of sales, we now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 12.5%, reflecting favorable tax discretes recognized in the second quarter. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.475 billion shares for Q3 2023 and 1.464 billion shares for full year 2023. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.96 to $2, representing 15% to 17% growth versus 2022, which we believe delivers top tier financial performance. We continue to anticipate a neutral impact from FX on our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share and we expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.46 to $0.48.For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2023 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q2 results and 2023 guidance. In closing, I'm very proud of our first half financial performance with top tier organic revenue growth of 13%, adjusted operating margin of 26.2% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 20%, all contributing towards our top-tier financial goals. I look forward to continued momentum in the second half of 2023. And with that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&amp;A.Lauren Tengler: Thanks, Dan. Kyle, let's open it up for questions for the next 35 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit their self to one question.

286,a31fad23-cde5-384b-a30e-e4b26c6da80d,BSX,2023-07-29,BD (BDX) Gears Up for Q3 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bd-bdx-gears-q3-earnings-174300955.html,1690566180,STORY,"['BDX', 'MCK', 'BSX']","[Becton Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 3, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings per share (EPS) of $2.86 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, delivering an earnings surprise of 5.8%, on average.Let’s check out the factors that have shaped BDX’s performance prior to this announcement.Factors to NoteBD Life SciencesOn second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call in May, BD confirmed that it continued to witness lower COVID-only testing revenues, which led to a decline in its Life Sciences segment. However, excluding COVID-only testing, an uptick in the Life Sciences segment’s base revenues was solid. Strong growth across both Integrated Diagnostic Solutions (IDS) and Biosciences (BDB) business units was witnessed.Strength in IDS reflected strong base business revenue growth. This was driven by growth in Microbiology, aided by the adoption of BD Kiestra IdentifA and Total Modular Track solutions, and Specimen Management and continued double-digit growth from Molecular In-Vitro Diagnostic assay leveraging the incremental BD Max installed base. BDB unit has also been recording strong Research Reagents growth and continued strong demand for its BD FACSymphony A1/A5 SE research analyzers combined with improved BD FACSLyric.These trends are likely to have continued in third-quarter fiscal 2023 as well. This, in turn, is anticipated to have contributed to the strength in base business despite the expected ceaseless fall in COVID-only testing revenues. This is likely to have significantly driven up the segmental revenues.BD has launched a few products in recent months. In June, the company announced the worldwide commercial launch of a new automated instrument, BD FACSDuet Premium Sample Preparation System.Story continuesIn May, announced the worldwide commercial launch of a new-to-world cell sorting instrument, BD FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter, featuring two breakthrough technologies (BD SpectralFX Technology and BD CellView Image Technology). These products are likely to have witnessed robust customer adoptions, thereby pushing up the segmental revenues in the fiscal third quarter.In May, BD received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for the new BD Kiestra Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus imaging application. This raises our optimism about the stock.However, the continued decline in COVID-only testing revenues is likely to have weighed on BD’s Life Sciences segment’s revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2023. Despite this, on the fiscal second-quarter earnings call, management stated that its base revenue growth and consistent execution of its margin goals are enabling BD to offset lower COVID-only testing revenues and the latest foreign exchange rates while reinvesting in the business to drive future growth. This looks promising for the stock.The Zacks Model estimates the BD Life Sciences revenues to be $1.32 billion, suggesting an improvement of 0.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and EPS SurpriseBecton, Dickinson and Company Price and EPS SurpriseBecton, Dickinson and Company price-eps-surprise | Becton, Dickinson and Company QuoteBD InterventionalThis segment continued to witness a strong worldwide performance in Advanced Repair and Reconstruction in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Continued strong market adoption of Phasix hernia resorbable scaffold and double-digit worldwide growth in Biosurgery (aided by Arista AH absorbable hemostat) resulted in the upturn. Strong procedure volumes had also contributed to the Surgery’s performance.Revenues in Peripheral Intervention were also strong. Double-digit growth in Peripheral Vascular Disease on the back of the Venovo relaunch, global penetration of Rotarex and the strong growth in Oncology in the United States and Greater Asia acted as tailwinds. Robust Urology and Critical Care revenues were driven by double-digit growth in the PureWick franchise (which addresses chronic incontinence) and Endourology.These trends are likely to have been continued in the fiscal third quarter as well, thereby significantly pushing up the segmental revenues.A notable announcement in this segment was BD’s inking a definitive agreement to sell its Surgical Instrumentation platform to STERIS. The company will provide additional details about the divestiture, expected to close within BD's fiscal year 2023, subject to customary closing conditions, in its fiscal third-quarter earnings call.The Zacks Model estimates the BD Interventional revenues to be $1.16 billion, suggesting an uptick of 1.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Other Factors to NoteBD is likely to have witnessed continued momentum in its Medical segment. Continued strong performance in Vascular Access Management and investments in high-growth end markets like Pharmacy Automation, among others, resulted in this uptrend. BD is also likely to have benefited from continued capacity investments in BD Hypak and innovation in products like BD Effivax, BD Hylok and BD Neopak.In May, BD announced expanded customer availability of an all-in-one prefilled flush syringe with an integrated disinfection unit, BD PosiFlush SafeScrub. On the fiscal second-quarter earnings call, management confirmed the launch of PowerMe midline catheter in China. These products are likely to have witnessed robust adoption in recent months, thereby driving up revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the current unstable macroeconomic business environment, resulting from the supply-chain constraints and inflationary pressures, is likely to have weighed on the company’s fiscal third-quarter revenues, raising our apprehension.The Estimate PictureFor third-quarter fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.83 billion, implying an improvement of 4.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus estimate for EPS is pegged at $2.89, indicating an increase of 8.7% from the prior-year period’s reported number.What Our Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for BD this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: BD has an Earnings ESP of +0.48%.

The positivity came after the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge showcased cooling prices and hit its lowest level in nearly two years.Jay Powell didn’t declare victory over inflation when the Fed raised rates by 0.25% on Wednesday. But he certainly wasn’t hawkish either. Wall Street is growing increasingly confident that the Fed is all but done hiking. On top of that, the earnings picture is holding up very well as we get deeper into the heart of Q2 earnings season.  With this in mind, we dive into three somewhat under-the-radar large-cap stocks that all reported upbeat quarterly results already that investors might want to buy as we head into August.Paychex (PAYX)Paychex is a software company focused on payroll and other HR-centric offerings such as benefit management, insurance, and beyond. Paychex’s growing suite of HR-based software and technology has helped it amass roughly 740k customers across the U.S. and Europe. The firm is not a household name like Salesforce and some other business software companies. Yet Paychex boasts that its software helps pay one out of every 12 private sector employees in the U.S.Paychex has grown its revenue and earnings at steady clips over the last decade, including 14% top-line expansion in its fiscal 2022 and 9% in FY23—period ended on May 31, 2023—to reach $5 billion for the first time. Looking ahead, PAYX’s revenue is projected to pop 7% in FY24 and another 5% in FY25 to reach $5.62 billion. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are expected to climb by 10% in FY24 and 7% higher in its fiscal 2024, which comes on top of 13% EPS growth last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPaychex’s earnings revisions have continued to climb over the last several years and its more recent upbeat EPS trends help it grab a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. The company boosted its dividend payout by 13% earlier this year, with a yield of 2.8% right now. It is worth stressing as well that digital payroll services and more are nearly ubiquitous and never going out of style.Story continuesPaychex stock has climbed 210% in the last decade to top the S&amp;P 500 and its industry, which are both up around 180%. PAYX shares have surged 72% in the past three years, but are down around 1% in the past 12 months vs. the benchmark’s 10% climb. That said, the stock has ripped 16% higher since its Q4 FY23 report on June 29.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite the rebound, Paychex trades 9% below its record highs. Plus, PAYX climbed back above its 50-week moving average in early July and it is now above its 50-day and 200-day, with it prepared to complete the golden cross, where the shorter-dated trendline climbs back above the longer-term trend. Paychex is also trading at a 25% discount to its highs at 26.9X forward earnings and right near its own decade-long median.Textron (TXT)Textron operates in the broader Aerospace – Defense segment with a wide-range of offerings in the field, as well as far more commercial segments. TXT’s various units and brands include Bell, Cessna, Beechcraft, Pipistrel, Arctic Cat, and more. For instance, Arctic Cat is a leader in the snowmobile and the small off-road vehicle space such as ATVs and side-by-sides. Textron’s Cessna unit is a major player in the world of private aviation for business travel and other, mostly non-commercial flight.Textron’s Pipistrel segment is attempting to push the boundaries of electric aircrafts. TXT’s portfolio also includes Bell, which landed a potentially huge contract with the U.S. Army in late 2022. Textron’s next-generation helicopters are set to become the U.S. Army’s new long-range assault aircraft. The contract could be worth up to $80 billion based on multiple reports.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTextron, which currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), on July 27 posted an impressive beat-and-raise quarter. TXT topped our Q2 EPS estimate by 22%, with its adjusted earnings up 32% YoY. The company also boosted its bottom-line outlook to between $5.20 - $5.30 a share vs. our current $5.09 consensus, which would already mark 27% growth. Zacks estimates call for another solid year of bottom-line expansion in FY24 and strong revenue expansion. And expect analysts to raise these outlooks in the coming days and weeks following TXT’s Q2 report.Textron earlier this month said it approved a new stock buyback program. And six of the 11 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys,” next to five “Holds.” TXT stock is up 165% in the last 10 years to blow away its Aerospace – Defense industry’s 29%. This run includes a 121% surge in the last 36 months. TXT stock has, however, chopped around rather heavily over the last two years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTextron is now up 8% YTD, after it soared following its blowout Q2 results and guidance. TXT is attempting to hit new highs and break out of its current range. TXT is now back above its 50-week moving average and it soared above its 200-day. TXT currently trades below its average Zacks price target. Some investors might appreciate that it sits at around $76 per share, while Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman both trade for around $450 per share.Despite its long-term outperformance of the Aerospace – Defense industry, Textron trades at a roughly 40% discount at 14.4X forward 12-month earnings. TXT’s current valuation also represents 9% value vs. its own decade-long median and 32% compared to its own highs.United Rentals (URI) United Rentals is one of the world’s largest equipment rental firms. URI’s portfolio allows its customers, which include construction firms, utility companies, and far beyond, to rent scissor lifts, towable light towers, generators, and nearly everything else under the sun. The firm’s revenue was booming prior to Covid, with sales up between 15% to 21% for three straight years until they slipped in 2020. But URI quickly left its setbacks behind and posted 14% sales growth in FY21 and 20% in 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnited Rentals has been able to lift its prices alongside inflation, while benefiting from its Ahern Rentals acquisition in late 2022. United Rentals carried over its momentum into 2023, and it topped our Q2 earnings and revenue estimates on July 26. URI, which grabs a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now, also boosted its FY23 outlook. CEO Matthew Flannery said in prepared remarks that it remains “encouraged by the momentum we are carrying into the busiest part of our season as well as our customers’ continued optimism.” Current Zacks estimates call for URI’s sales to jump 20% in 2023 and another 4% in 2024. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to surge by 22% and 9%, respectively. And expect these projections to improve as more analysts update their outlooks. United Rentals aims to keep capitalizing on multi-year tailwinds across infrastructure, manufacturing, and energy and power.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchURI has surged 650% in the past 10 years to crush the S&amp;P 500’s 180% and the Zacks construction sector’s 160%. United Rentals is up 37% in the last 12 months, with it hovering around 8% below its all-time highs. The stock found support at its 50-week moving back in May, and its recent run has it trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. And URI is trading at a 40% discount to its own decade-long highs and right at its median of 10.6X forward 12-month earnings.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Eric Salander. Please go ahead.Eric Salander: Thanks, Kaylie and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release. On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Revenues in the quarter were $3.4 billion, up $270 million from last year's second quarter. Segment profit in the quarter was $352 million, up $71 million from the second quarter of 2022. During this year's second quarter, we reported income from continuing operations of $1.30 per share.Adjusted income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.46 per share compared to $1.11 per share in last year's second quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions, a non-GAAP measure, totaled $242 million in the quarter compared to $309 million in the second quarter of 2022. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.Scott Donnelly: Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter was a strong quarter with revenue up across all our businesses and solid execution, generating a segment profit margin of 10.3%, up 140 basis points from the second quarter of 2022. At Aviation in the quarter, we delivered 44 jets, down from 48 last year and 37 commercial turboprops, up from 35 in last year's second quarter. Aviation continues to see solid demand across jet and turboprop products. Backlog grew $315 million, ending the second quarter at $6.8 billion. In the quarter, Aviation received an order for 11 Special Mission King Air 360s expecting to deliver in 2024 and 2025. Also during the quarter, Aviation delivered the first passenger configured Cessna SkyCourier to Lāna’i Air for its Hawaiian interisland routes.Story continuesOn the new product front, Aviation announced the Cessna Citation Ascend at Ebase ph in May. Ascend will feature the latest Garman 5000 avionics suite, 4-passenger range of 1900 nautical miles, comfortable cabin experience with large windows and a flat floor and the new Pratt 545D engine that features improved thrust and increased time between overhauls and enhanced fuel efficiency. The aircraft is expected to enter into service in 2025. Moving to Bell, revenues were slightly higher in the quarter. Bell began ramping activity on the FLRAA program, including on-boarding engineers, contracting with major suppliers and ordering long lead materials. Bell also added $1.2 billion of backlog related to the FLRAA contract during the quarter. Also in the quarter, Bell received an initial contract authorization for four additional V-22 aircraft.Pixabay/Public DomainOn the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 35 helicopters, up from 34 in last year's second quarter. At Textron Systems, we saw a continued solid margin performance on slightly higher revenues. In June, Systems delivered Craft 107 to the U.S. Navy Ship-to-Shore Connector program, the Aircraft delivered to the Navy. Also during the quarter, Systems Aerosonde Hybrid Quad UAS was among four competing unmanned aerial systems that were awarded design contract under the first option of the Army's Future Tactical Amend Aircraft Systems Program. Systems also advanced as part of Team Lynx led by American Rheinmetall in the next phase of the U.S. Army's XM30 program. Textron Systems is a designated manufacturer of Team Lynx. The Army down selected two competitors for the next phase of the program, which includes detailed design and prototype builds.Moving to Industrial, we saw higher revenues in the quarter, driven by higher volume in both Kautex and Specialized Vehicles. At Specialized Vehicles, we announced the new Liberty LSV, a street legal vehicle powered by our elite battery system with four forward-facing seats. Within Kautex, we saw increased volumes year-over-year across all our geographic end markets. Moving to Aviation, we began wind tunnel testing on the Nexus eVTOL aircraft. These tests represent a significant step in the aircraft development process and supporting design validation activities. Additionally, we continued the prototype assembly and systems integration of the Nuuva, our hybrid electric unmanned cargo VTOL aircraft at our facilities in Slovenia. With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.Frank Connor: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.4 billion were up $78 million from the second quarter of 2022 reflecting higher pricing of $95 million, partially offset by lower volume and mix. Segment profit was $171 million in the second quarter, up $22 million from a year ago, largely due to favorable pricing net of inflation of $52 million, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from performance of $23 million. Performance included unfavorable manufacturing performance largely related to supply chain and labor inefficiencies. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $6.8 billion. Moving to Bell, revenues were $701 million, up $14 million from last year due to higher pricing of $21 million, partially offset by lower military revenue of $7 million.Segment profit of $65 million was up $11 million from last year's second quarter due to a favorable impact from performance of $13 million, largely reflecting lower research and development costs and a favorable impact from pricing net of inflation of $9 million, partially offset by lower volume and mix. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $5.6 billion. At Textron Systems, revenues were $306 million, up $13 million from last year's second quarter, largely reflecting higher volume. Segment profit of $37 million was down $1 million from a year ago. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.9 billion. Industrial revenues were $1 billion, up $155 million from last year's second quarter, largely due to higher volume and mix at both Kautex and Textron Specialized Vehicles of $121 million and a favorable impact from pricing of $37 million.Segment profit of $79 million was up $42 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher volume and mix of $32 million and a favorable impact from pricing net of inflation of $17 million, principally at Kautex, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of $10 million from performance. Textron eAviation segment revenues were $11 million and segment loss was $12 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting research and development costs. Finance segment revenues were $18 million and profit was $12 million. Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $21 million, net interest expense was $16 million, LIFO inventory provision was $35 million, intangible asset amortization was $10 million and the non-service components of pension and postretirement income were $59 million.In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.2 million shares, returning $273 million in cash to shareholders. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 9.4 million shares, returning $650 million in cash to shareholders. Earlier this week, Textron's Board of Directors approved a new authorization for the repurchase of up to 35 million shares under which the company intends to repurchase shares to offset the impact of dilution from stock-based compensation and benefit plans and for opportunistic capital management purposes. To wrap up with guidance, we are increasing our expected full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $5.20 to $5.30 per share, up from our prior range of $5 to $5.20 per share. We also continue to expect full year manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions of $900 million to $1 billion.That concludes our remarks.

292,f85403df-01c3-31b9-bc32-4eb523846cca,NSC,2023-07-29,Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norfolk-southern-corporation-nyse-nsc-120422727.html,1690632262,STORY,['NSC'],"[Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase Norfolk Southern's shares on or after the 3rd of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 21st of August.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.35 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$5.40 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Norfolk Southern has a trailing yield of 2.3% on the current stock price of $236.66. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Norfolk Southern's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Norfolk Southern has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Norfolk Southern paying out a modest 46% of its earnings. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out more than half (60%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.It's positive to see that Norfolk Southern's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're discomforted by Norfolk Southern's 9.6% per annum decline in earnings in the past five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Norfolk Southern has delivered an average of 10% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments.Final TakeawayIs Norfolk Southern an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Its earnings per share have been declining meaningfully, although it is paying out less than half its income and more than half its cash flow as dividends. Neither payout ratio appears an immediate concern, but we're concerned about the earnings. All things considered, we are not particularly enthused about Norfolk Southern from a dividend perspective.However if you're still interested in Norfolk Southern as a potential investment, you should definitely consider some of the risks involved with Norfolk Southern. For example - Norfolk Southern has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

293,d5c0f530-e621-35f7-bd23-7be4ca49bff0,KO,2023-07-29,10 Recession-Proof Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-recession-proof-stocks-billionaires-235457192.html,1690588497,STORY,"['JNJ', 'AAPL', 'ELV', 'CL', 'KO']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 10 recession-proof stocks billionaires are loading up on. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Recession-Proof Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.Latest data on inflation has upped the hopes of investors as market naysayers who had been warning of recession for several months are on the back foot now. Since inflation is still high and far above the Federal Reserve’s target, many still believe we can see a moderate recession in the coming months. But now there are many ifs and buts before such recession calls. For example, in June, talking to Bloomberg, Newedge Wealth's Cameron Dawson said that she expects a 350-point drop in the S&amp;P 500 in the next six months. She said the recession expectations could be “realistic” if you “start to see the whites of the eyes of a recession showing up."" But she also said that if earnings continue to show resiliency “then maybe that doesn't look like something that's in the cards.""Similarly, Tony Crescenzi, executive VP at investment management firm Pimco, said that he believes the US is already in a “growth recession.” Simply put, according to Crescenzi, growth recession is when the economy is not growing at its true potential and demand is lower than supply.He believes the US has the potential for an annual growth of 1.8% but he believes currently the growth is below that. However, there’s a silver lining here. Crescenzi thinks this growth recession would give supply a chance to catchup with demand. When the gap between supply and demand will narrow, the Federal Reserve won’t need to keep increasing interest rates.“The Fed could say we needn't raise interest rates any more, and if supply catches up enough, in a growth recession it can happen, then eventually there are interest-rate cuts,” Crescenzi said, in an interview with Bloomberg.In its Q3 outlook report, American Century Investments said that it takes time for monetary policy actions to show their real effects. The report said that while the economy is still strong and unemployment is low, there are areas that are slowing as the firm said it believes “ a recession awaits us down the road.” American Century said that it isn’t alone in its skepticism of policymakers’ ability to control inflation without triggering a recession. The report quoted former Fed economist Claudia Sahm who said that a recession was expected for a long time but  “we’re finally getting to the moment of truth.”Story continuesThe report also quoted American Century’s interview with former Kansas City Fed President Esther George who thinks that while the Fed’s intention is obviously not to trigger a recession, in case we experience a recession, it would not be the first time rate hikes have triggered one.American Century Investments also said that in light of expectations that inflation is here to stay, investors should protect their portfolios from inflation. And for that they should look for solid companies. Here’s what the report said:“Against a recessionary backdrop, we think equity style distinctions are less important. We’re emphasizing quality instead. This means we’re focusing more on companies with stable revenues, repeatable profits, low indebtedness, stable cash flows and predictable business models less sensitive to economic conditions.”However, the report does not paint all doom and gloom. It also said that in the second half of 2023 earnings are expected to remain strong amid lowering inventory of semiconductors and increasing economic activity in China and Asia.The report further highlights that while the markets rallied earlier this year, there is a lot of optimism among investors that the Federal Reserve might start cutting rates down the road. American Century believes this is not a correct presumption. The report said that investors should continue to invest in businesses that are positioned to gain in the long term instead of focusing on short-term, assumption-based dynamics of the market.Wells Fargo also published its mid-year outlook 2023 report in June. Wells Fargo said that the bear markets of 2022 and 2023 are expected to evolve into recession in the back half of 2023 or early 2024. Wells Fargo said that this would be the most predicted and longest anticipated recession. Wells Fargo said that economic cycles are natural and what’s important for investors is to position their portfolios accordingly.“Our guidance — to remain defensive in portfolio positioning — has remained consistent through this period, and we reiterate that guidance in our 2023 Midyear Outlook.”Wells Fargo also believes that after 2023 recession earnings will expand in 2024 and valuations will rebound. The bank said in its report that investors should prefer quality stocks, which have “sound balance sheets, strong levels of profitability and cash flow, the ability to generate consistent growth, and earnings stability.”“As is typical, equity prices likely will increase at a much more rapid pace than earnings can recover, leading to price/earnings (P/E) multiple spikes and above-average valuations in 2024. However, once the earnings recovery catches up to the price recovery during the back half of next year, we expect multiples to revert to average levels. The following chart illustrates how our view of earnings and multiple expansion could combine to drive returns this year and next, and how this expected interplay relates to history. It shows calendar-year contributions to return for the S&amp;P 500 Index from 2007 to 2022 as well as our forecasts for 2023 and 2024.”Recession-Proof Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnOur MethodologyBillionaires have also been anticipating a recession and it’s always interesting to see how they are positioning their portfolios according to market environment. For this article we first scanned and listed all stock holdings of the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund (VIG), which is considered among the top defensive ETFs investors prefer during recessionary environments. For each stock holding of the ETF, we looked for the number of billionaires having stakes in them using Insider Monkey’s comprehensive data of billionaire-owned stocks. We then picked 10 of these stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.Recession-Proof Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On10. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Billionaire Investors: 18With six decades of consistent dividend increases under its belt and long-term growth catalysts, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) remains one of the safest stocks to buy for both recession and normal market environments.Morgan Stanley last month made some changes to its global dividend portfolio. However, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) continues to feature in the portfolio.A total of 17 billionaire-led hedge funds were bullish on Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.

Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Billionaire Investors: 18Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) has increased its dividend for over six decades now.

E. Shaw, Dan Loeb, Ray Dalio and Cliff Asness.Third Point Management made the following comment about Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Existing positions in LVMH, Disney and Microsoft gained while FIS, Bath &amp; Body Works, and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) posted losses after their management teams lowered 2023 guidance despite reporting solid quarterly results. FIS and Colgate have both since “beat and raised” this guidance, indicating that many management teams are adopting very conservative tones in this uncertain macro environment.”8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Billionaire Investors: 18Hardly any list of best defensive stocks for recessions is written without mentioning The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), which has upped its dividends consistently for six decades and which has several billionaire stakeholders. The most important of these billionaires is Warren Buffett, whose hedge fund owns a $25 billion stake in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).7. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Billionaire Investors: 18A total of 18 billionaires in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as of the end of the first quarter. The most prominent of them was of course Warren Buffett whose hedge fund had a whopping $151 billion stake in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors rejoiced at the company’s surpassing of $3 trillion valuation in June. While Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s valuation has fallen below the $3 trillion market as of July 13, analysts are highly bullish on the future prospects of Apple. Last month, Citi analyst Atif Malik said in a note that analysts were underestimating Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s gross margin expansion. Malik said that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was gaining market share from Android and benefitting from the blend of iPhone Pro and Pro Max models. Malik started covering Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a Buy rating and a $240 price target.6. Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV)Number of Billionaire Investors: 19Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) ranks 6th in our list of the best recession-proof stocks to buy according to billionaires. Because Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) is operating in a recession-proof industry and pays dividends, it saw an increased interest from investors earlier this year when recession risks surged. Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds shows that 81 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) as of the end of the first quarter, up from 75 funds in the previous quarter.The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) during this period was billionaire Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global which owns a $991 million stake in the company.Madison Investors Fund made the following comment about Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We purchased Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) and trimmed Marsh &amp; McLennan and Arch Capital. Elevance is the largest for-profit Blue Cross Blue Shield plan in the country, supporting the largest domestic membership base across the managed care industry. While national scale is important, local scale is critical as well, given the localized nature of healthcare delivery. Elevance scores well on both fronts, giving it strong bargaining power with providers, lower customer acquisition costs, deep population health data and analytics, and the ability to offer attractive health benefit packages. All this combines to create a formidable moat for its business.We also believe the management team is top-notch. Since joining Elevance from a senior leadership position at peer UnitedHealth Group, CEO Gail Boudreaux has further leveraged the company’s scale advantage by expanding its internal healthcare services capabilities through a newly formed business unit called Carelon. As the industry transitions to a reimbursement system that emphasizes patient outcomes over procedure or testing volume, data analytics will be a crucial tool in managing patient care.

We have also covered interesting insights about female athletes and the companies who are actively supporting and investing in them. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 5 Highest-Paid Female Athletes in the World.  Long gone are the days when women's sports were confined to the shadows, overshadowed by their male counterparts. Today, female athletes are commanding attention, breaking records, and shattering glass ceilings, while their influence extends far beyond the field or court. Apart from women making contribution in athletics today, being an athlete is also one of the most profitable professions in the world.  The Fight for Equal PayFor years, the U.S. women's national soccer team fought for equal pay and treatment. This led to a truly historic moment when representatives for both the men's and women's teams signed their respective collective bargaining agreements with U.S. Soccer. The struggle for equal pay was characterized by a federal gender discrimination lawsuit filed by the women against U.S. Soccer in 2019 that drew international attention and support with fans chanting ""Equal Pay!"" during the Women's World Cup final.The women's team had been successful on the international stage, winning back-to-back World Cup titles, but faced huge disparities in FIFA prize money compared to the men's team. While the women received a $110,000 bonus for their 2019 World Cup victory, the men would have earned $407,000 had they won in 2018.After long and sometimes acrimonious negotiations, the new agreement has secured identical pay structures for appearances and tournament victories, revenue sharing, and equitable distribution of World Cup prize money. The deal involved pooling FIFA's payments for the men's World Cup and the upcoming Women's World Cup, as well as future tournaments until 2028.Story continuesHow Much Money Do Female Athletes Make?According to Forbes, in 2022, the 25 highest-paid female athletes worldwide collectively earned approximately $285 million before deductions for taxes and agents' fees. Among them, the top ten athletes contributed a large portion, amassing a total of $194 million. This figure represents a notable increase of 17% compared to the previous year's top ten, which had set a record of $167 million in 2021.On the other hand, as of 2023, Cristiano Ronaldo is the highest-paid athlete, with an estimated $136 million in earnings over the past 12 months.

LorberbaumThanks, Jim. Mohawk's second quarter net sales were $2.95 billion, down approximately 6.4% as reported or 9.6% on a constant and legacy basis, primarily due to continued pressure in residential remodeling across all of our regions. Our adjusted EPS was $2.76, as our margins across the enterprise expanded sequentially due to seasonal improvements, increased production, productivity initiatives and lower input costs. We generated over $145 million of free cash flow during the quarter, further strengthening our financial position.Typical of housing recessions, higher interest rates and inflation are significantly impacting flooring sales around the world. To manage, we are selectively investing to increase sales and reducing expenses by enhancing productivity, consolidating distribution points and improving administrative efficiencies. In the quarter, we initiated restructuring and integration actions that will save $35 million annually at a cost of approximately $17 million. We anticipate approximately half of the estimated savings should be realized in the current year, partially offsetting the weak residential remodeling activity.In addition, we're limiting future capital investments to those delivering significant sales, margin and operational improvements. In all of our regions, we're taking actions to increase sales, including promotions, retailer incentives and selective product launches. The integration of our recent acquisition is progressing as we combine strategies and enhance our manufacturing and product offering. While managing lower market demand, we're preparing for the rebound that historically follows cyclical declines in our industry.Our LVT premium laminate, quartz countertop, porcelain slab, insulation, manufacturing expansion should deliver the greatest growth as the market recovers. Across our regions, we continue to see strong results in the commercial sector than in Residential. Residential remodeling remains the industry's greatest headwind due to lower home sales and deferred improvement projects. We believe channel inventories have declined and could be at a bottom.Price competition is increasing with declining industry volume, mix and input costs. In the U.S., the housing markets remain under pressure due to limited supply, high interest rates and continued inflation. Existing homeowners are not moving at historical levels to maintain their low mortgage rates. In Q2, new home starts increased to $1.45 million, showing the first quarterly increase since the beginning of last year. We believe the trend in housing starts will continue and will positively impact flooring shipments in the future. In our regions, home sales and remodeling are also declining due to inflation and interest rates. In Europe, energy prices have continued to decline, though persistent inflation in other categories is limiting consumer remodeling. In the quarter, we benefited from lower energy prices that flow through our P&amp;L. Our investments in biomass, solar and wind energy production reduced our operational expenses and carbon footprint positively impacting our performance.During the second quarter, the Italian government provided energy subsidies at a reduced level and the program will not be continued. In May, USA Today write Mohawk is one of America's businesses that made the greatest reductions in our global emissions over the past 3 years. Mohawk was the only flooring company recognized reinforcing our position as a global leader in sustainability.Earlier this month, we announced that Bernard Thiers will be stepping down as President of Flooring Rest of World next year and will continue with the company in a senior advisory role to support a smooth transition. Bernard has made many important contributions to the success of the business since we acquired Unilin in 2005. He has led the Flooring Rest of World segment for the past 14 years and delivered profitable growth by expanding our product offering, entering new geographies and bringing new product innovation to the market. I'm proud of the exceptional team that Bernard has assembled across this segment.Wim Messiaen will be joining Mohawk in October after he completes his contractual notice period. He will become President of Flooring Rest of World on February 1. Wim has more than 30 years of leadership experience with multinational packaging, building products and flooring manufacturers in Europe, Asia and Australia. He has considerable experience driving both growth organically and through acquisitions. Wim will complement our strong leadership team with a passion for innovation, strong customer focus and a commitment to sustainability.Jim will now cover our financial performance for the second quarter.James F. BrunkThank you, Jeff. Sales exceeded $2.9 billion for the quarter. That's a 6.4% decrease as reported and 9.6% on a legacy and constant basis, as global inflation and higher interest rates significantly impacted the flooring industry volumes, especially in residential remodeling channel. Our global ceramic business had the strongest year-over-year sales performance in part due to a greater exposure to commercial and new home construction, which outperformed residential remodeling.Gross margin for the quarter was 24.8% as reported and excluding onetime items, was 25.9% versus 27.7% in the prior year. The year-over-year decline is due to softening volume, temporary plant shutdowns, unfavorable price/mix, higher inflation and the net impact of FX, partially offset by productivity gains. The actual detailed amounts of these items will be included in the MD&amp;A of our 10-Q, which will be filed after this call.SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of sales was 19.6% as reported and excluding onetime items, was 17.6% versus 16% in the prior year. The increase in SG&amp;A expense was primarily attributable to higher inflation the net impact of acquisitions, partially offset by productivity gains. Operating income as reported was 5.2%. Restructuring, integration and other items were $91 million for the quarter, comprised of legal settlements and reserves as disclosed in our quarterly filing, costs associated with restructuring actions announced in 2022, and acquisition and integration costs, primarily for our ceramic acquisitions in Mexico and Brazil.Also in the quarter, we have taken additional actions across the enterprise to lower our costs and strengthen our results. The total cost of these actions is $17 million for an annual savings of approximately $35 million once completed. Operating margin, excluding charges, was 8.3% for the quarter. The decline year-over-year was primarily driven by the lower sales volume and higher inflation along with temporary plant shutdowns, and negative price mix and the unfavorable net impact of FX, partially offset by productivity gains.Sequentially, though, we saw significant margin expansion as seasonal volume helped strengthen our quarterly sales and reduce our manufacturing shutdowns. And lower costs, especially in raw material and energy, combined with increased productivity, offset weakening price and mix. Interest expense for the quarter was $23 million, increasing from the prior year, mainly due to the higher interest rates.Non-GAAP tax rate was 19.5% versus 22% in the prior year. Our forecasted Q3 tax rate is between 18% and 19%, and the full year rate is forecasted to be 19% to 20%. Earnings per share as reported were $1.58 and excluding charges were $2.76.Turning to the segments. Global Ceramic Segment had sales just shy of $1.2 billion. That was basically flat as reported and a decrease of 6.7% on a legacy and constant basis. Weaker volume and unfavorable FX were only partially offset by positive price and mix. Compared to the prior year, our business in the U.S. held up the strongest in the quarter led by its performance in commercial and new construction. Operating margin excluding charges was 8.6% as higher interest rates and inflation are impacting the flooring industry across our regions to varying degrees, leading to lower volumes and increased plant shutdowns, partially offset by productivity gains, positive price mix and the favorable impact of FX. Turning to Flooring North America. Sales just exceeded $1 billion. That was an 8.9% decrease as reported and 12% on a legacy basis. Especially in the residential remodeling channel and negative impact of price mix along with the lower volume. In the quarter, the year-over-year weakening conditions were felt the most in our residential soft surface businesses. Operating margin, excluding charges, was 6% as current economic conditions with reduced inventory volumes and increased competition is driving negative price mix, lowering sales volume and creating more temporary plant shutdowns, partially offset by decreasing input costs. It should be noted that sequentially, we saw strong margin expansion in both Global Ceramic and the Flooring North American segments.Lastly, Flooring Rest of the World sales is just over $790 million. That's an 11.4% decrease as reported and 10.2% on a legacy and constant days basis. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower volume, negative price mix and unfavorable FX. The weakness in residential remodeling was felt the most in our Laminate and Wood businesses. In addition, our insulation and panels business was negatively impacted by the deferral of new projects.Operating margin, excluding charges, was 12.1%. As consumer spending in our category has not improved at this point and market competition increases, we are negatively impacted by the lower volume, temporary plant shutdowns and unfavorable net impact of FX, partially offset by productivity gains. Corporate and eliminations was $12 million for the quarter. And on a full year basis, corporate expenses should be approximately $45 million.Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were $571 million for the quarter, with free cash flow of $147 million in Q2 versus a use in the prior year. Free cash flow year-to-date is over $275 million. Receivables were just shy of $2.1 billion with a DSO of 58 days versus 56 in the prior year and prior quarter. Inventories for the quarter finished at just over [$2.6 billion] and excluding the impact of acquisitions, inventories decreased $277 million versus Q2 of 2022. Inventory days are at 120 days versus 116 in the prior year, but has decreased from the 128 days in the prior quarter.Property, plant and equipment is just shy of $5 billion. Q2 CapEx was $117 million with D&amp;A of $157 million. For the full year, our forecast includes CapEx of approximately $600 million with D&amp;A of $595 million.Finally, gross debt finished just shy of $3.1 billion with leverage at 1.8x adjusted EBITDA. This provides us the flexibility and strength as we look forward to the rebound in our industry.Now Chris will review our Q2 operational performance.William Christopher WellbornThank you, Jim. Our Global Ceramic Segment's result improved from the first quarter with increased sales, higher production and lower energy costs. Around the globe, high interest rates and inflation are reducing housing sales and remodeling investments to varying degrees based on local conditions. We believe that most of our customers have now aligned their inventory levels with market conditions. Our asset utilization remained low with compressed demand, and we further reduced our inventory and working capital. Our P&amp;L benefited from lower materials and energy flowing through the inventory. This reduction was partially offset by greater market competition and lower mix, which impacted our selling prices.While energy costs around the world have substantially decreased, they continue to be highly volatile. In our acquisitions in Brazil and Mexico, we are realigning the organization's, defining new sales and product strategies and executing cost reductions. Our U.S. Ceramic business benefited from a greater participation in the commercial and new construction channels, enhanced styling and more consistent service. As energy and freight cost decline and industry volumes weaken, the market is becoming more competitive. We are introducing higher-style products to improve our mix and are focusing on stronger sales channels. We have expanded our customer base, which is helping to offset the weakness in residential remodeling.In the quarter, we further reduced our inventory while maintaining high service levels. The decline in energy prices will improve our cost as it flows through our inventory. We have taken cost reduction actions in response to increased competition and other inflation. As we prepare for the start of the additional countertop capacity, we are enhancing our product portfolio and expanding our kitchen and bath channel with complementary tile and countertop selections.Our Ceramic business in Europe remains under pressure as residential remodeling remains slow. Our volumes in the quarter improved sequentially, and our results benefited from sales of premium residential collections, commercial products and exports. Competition is becoming more intense in all channels due to low industry volume and declining energy costs. We are adjusting to the changing environment and using promotional activities to deliver additional volume. To utilize our new porcelain slab capacity, we are broadening our portfolio with innovative visuals and will manufacture products we have been outsourcing. We continue to focus on cost containment, including overhead reductions, productivity projects and alternative formulations.As with our other regions, our Latin American ceramic businesses are also being pressured by higher interest rates, which have compressed residential remodeling. We are making progress integrating our existing businesses and new acquisitions, and we have begun to leverage sales of our total product portfolio to expand our distribution. The combined synergies we are realizing are partially offsetting the weakening market conditions. By the end of the year, we should complete the migration of our acquisitions onto our existing information systems, which will facilitate further sales and cost opportunities.Of the 2 regions, Mexico is performing better due to the economy and lower interest rates, while Brazilian ceramic industry is now being more impacted by economic conditions after holding up longer. We are taking additional sales and operational actions to manage the softening environment. The Brazilian government has recently announced that it will subsidize low interest rate mortgages to support new home construction and help the economy.Our Flooring Rest of World segment continues to successfully manage a difficult environment. Consumer spending has not improved as we expected. Confidence remaining low given inflation, higher interest rates in the war in Ukraine. Sequentially, our sales volume and production rates improved from the first period. With low manufacturing utilization and declining input costs, industry pricing and mix continues under pressure. During the quarter, energy and raw material costs decline, partially offsetting weakening conditions. To manage lower volumes, we're pursuing additional sales, reducing cost and aligning production with demand. The segment's third quarter is seasonally impacted by extended vacations, which will reduce our sales and earnings in the period.Though our flooring sales are under pressure, our sheet vinyl collections are outperforming as consumers trade down to lower price alternatives to minimize project costs. To meet rising demand across our regions, we are increasing our sheet vinyl production. The integration of our Eastern European sheet vinyl acquisition has significantly progressed. We have enhanced its offering with higher performance products, sped up its operations and added another manufacturing shift to support growing volume. We are managing production of laminate and LVT to align with present demand and are introducing new products, merchandising and specific promotions to expand sales volumes. We have begun to transition our residential LVT offering from flexible rigid cores and are executing the previously announced restructuring to support this conversion.In our panels business, fewer projects are being initiated and industrial use has decreased due to slower market conditions. We are increasing sales of our higher-margin decorative HPL products as we expand our customer base. Our plant utilization remains low, and our selling prices are declining, partially offset by lower material costs, improved productivity and our green energy production. We have made considerable progress integrating our small board and mezzanine acquisitions, including enhancing their operations, aligning sales strategies and combining administrative functions.Long-term prospects for our insulation business remains strong, supported by increasing energy conservation and government regulations. Presently, demand is declining as residential and commercial investments are being deferred and new industry capacity is increasing competition in some of our markets. Industry pricing is declining as input costs fall and we are reducing expenses to adjust market conditions.Similar to our other regions, the Australia and New Zealand housing markets have softened due to inflation and higher interest rates. Our results for the quarter were impacted by lower volumes and mix in our residential channels, and we are introducing new products and selective promotions to increase sales volume. Our commercial sales in New Zealand were stronger, and we are leveraging our innovative collections to capture larger projects.Our Flooring North America segment has faced the same challenging conditions as inflation, high interest rates and more conservative lending practices have impacted the U.S. housing market and our industry. As we anticipated, the segment's margin sequentially expanded in the quarter due to seasonality and lower costs flowing through the inventory. To control costs, we have enhanced productivity, streamlined administrative functions and initiated restructuring actions. With weak residential remodeling and softer mix, retailers continue to tightly manage their inventory levels, further impacting demand in the quarter.With energy and raw material costs declining, market competition is increasing. New single-family home starts have begun to increase with some builders subsidizing interest rates to attract buyers. In retail, we are providing new product options to trade up consumers and value alternatives for those with budget constraints. To increase sales, we're initiating selective promotional activity, enhancing our product offering and introducing more consumer-friendly displays.The U.S. commercial sector has proven more resilient as businesses continue to invest in new construction and remodeling projects. The July Architectural Billing Index reflected a stable environment for new projects. We are experiencing some mix pressure in commercial as customers seek to maintain budgets. The hospitality and Main Street channels performed best in the quarter, and we are expecting our participation in the health care channels. Our unique products, which are certified carbon neutral are growing as they deliver superior performance with a negative carbon footprint. Our commercial accessories acquisition is performing well as we leverage our relationships to enhance its product sales. Mohawk is the leading producer of premium laminate due to our more realistic visuals and waterproof performance. We continue to see a broader adoption of our Redwood products in both retail and builder channels. We have increased our offering of our revolutionary signature technology, which enhances the richness of our Pergo and Karastan collections. We are aligning production with current conditions, implementing cost reductions and managing pricing and mix to optimize our results.In Residential carpet, we've seen a sequential improvement in sales and production, along with the decline in input costs, which improved our margins from the first quarter. We have enhanced our luxury Karastan and Godfrey Hirst collections and are providing retailer incentives to grow volumes. Our expanded solution-dyed polyester carpet portfolio is increasing our position with multifamily developers and single home builders, negatively impacting our product mix. We have integrated our recent non-woven acquisition and are improving its sales and operations.With the decline in ocean freight costs, market pressure for LVT are increasing and the U.S. Forced Labor Protection Act is impacting some shipments. Higher cost inventory reduced our margins as we adapted to the changing market. Our new rigid LVT introductions with updated visuals, WetProtect and antimicrobial technologies differentiate us in the market and our sheet vinyl sales rose as consumers selected more affordable options. Our West Coast LVT plant will continue to ramp up throughout the rest of the year.With that, I'll return the call to Jeff.Jeffrey S. LorberbaumThanks, Chris. Mohawk's second quarter performance reflected the positive impact of many initiatives we're executing across our business. We're managing the current market conditions while preparing for the rebound in demand that follows cyclical downturns. Central banks have raised interest rates to reduce inflation and are signaling that additional rate hikes are possible. In the U.S., we've seen a rise in builder confidence and housing starts will increase our residential new construction business. We expect the commercial sector to outperform the residential category through this year, even with continued weakness in the office category. Though employment remains strong, remodeling and existing home sales are being delayed due to limited housing availability, higher interest rates and inflation.Historically, when the economy recovers, these postponed remodeling projects fuel greater industry growth. Our new restructuring initiatives could save $35 million per year, and our recent acquisitions will add greater benefit to our results as we optimize their performance. In this competitive market, we expect continued pressure on pricing and mix, partially offset by the flow-through of lower material and energy costs.Our third quarter seasonally weakened through the summer holidays, lower consumer spending and lower production in Europe. Given these factors, we anticipate our third quarter adjusted EPS to be between $2.62 and $2.72, excluding any restructuring acquisition and other charges. At Mohawk, we're taking the necessary steps to manage today's challenges while preparing for tomorrow's opportunity. When Central Bank shift their focus to a more balanced approach, our business will accelerate as the industry recovers. In all of our regions, housing is in short supply, aging homes are in need of remodeling and businesses will invest to grow in more favorable conditions. These factors will create higher growth for flooring and our investments in capacity expansion and our recent acquisitions will further enhance our results.We'll now be glad to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Phil Ng of Jefferies.Philip H. NgJeff, you've been in the business for some time now. You've talked about potentially the R&amp;R cycle turning. Any color on the bidding activity you've seen through the last few months? And then when you look at the past cycles, what are some of the things that you're looking to kind of inform your view that it's inflecting? Is that existing homes turning rates coming down? Any color on that front would be really helpful.Jeffrey S. LorberbaumI guess as you look at the cycles, what happens is as we go through these downturns, the -- all the activity is postponed, our product category of flooring, nothing has to be replaced as it, from either braking or anything else. So when people get uncomfortable, it gets postponed. This cycle, though, is not really typical of the other ones, as you go through. What we believe is that when central banks changed a more balanced approach you'll see all the pent-up demand from these postponed purchases coming through, and that will expand the volume.At the same time, the mix improves as retail increases, the retail channel tends to have higher margins because customers pick higher-value products. And it's most effective now. So as that turns, you get an increase in it. And then the use of the asset goes up and reduces the cost per unit and the margins expand at the same time. This time, we think also that our new investments in expansion will allow us to increase the categories of the business that are growing the most, and we should see acquisitions help us position us as we come out of this because we should have them integrated about the time of things starts coming together. So we're optimistic about the long term.Philip H. NgGot you. Have you seen the order activity for the R&amp;R set of things at least flatten out here? Or it's still TBD free?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumWe're hoping it's at a bottom. Consumers, when they have inflation and they start managing their budgets, again, our category is more postponable than most. So we're hoping it's going to get better, but I can't say that we've seen it yet.James F. BrunkYes. If you look at also the fill the inventories in the channel across our region, customers did reduce inventory and did become more conservative. We believe most channels have largely aligned with the current conditions.Philip H. NgOkay. That's a perfect segue, Jim, to my next question. It sounds like inventory is flushed out to the channel. What about your inventory? Is your inventory at a good spot? The reason why I asked is because you started curtailing production pretty heavily last year and you're starting to lap that. It was a pretty negative headwind. So does that flip positive? Are you at a pretty good spot? Any color there would be really helpful.James F. BrunkSo from a year-over-year perspective, you heard that certainly inventory is down for the quarter. What is key to us is sequentially from Q2 -- from Q1 to Q2, the inventory decreased about $110 million. About 60% of that was volume and 40% was the lower cost. We do anticipate further inventory decreases this year. Certainly depending on demand and inflation. But what we're doing is we're keeping the inventory low, you get better churn in the plant operations, which helps with that unabsorbed overhead.Philip H. NgOkay. But you're still curtailing production in the back half. Is that what you're saying, Jim, on a year-over-year basis?James F. BrunkYes. If you look at -- you have to consider the seasonality as well. So you have certain shutdowns in the third quarter, mostly associated with Europe and the shutdowns. And then obviously, in the fourth quarter, you will also have shutdowns associated with holidays. Now in the fourth quarter, though, we would expect that the shutdowns would be less than in the prior year.OperatorOur next question comes from Keith Hughes of Truist.Keith Brian HughesYou've made some comments on Europe on pacing and demand. I might be confused in the geographies. If you could just go back over where you think particularly European consumer demand is trending during the quarter and here in July?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumWe had expected when we came out of the first quarter that the decline in energy prices, which was a huge burden on the consumer that we had expected it to come down and that the consumer would be positively impacted. At this point, we haven't seen the demand in flooring reflect that. Like here, there are more vacations being taken and other things experiences they're doing. But in our category, we haven't seen an improvement yet.Keith Brian HughesOkay. And you've talked about lower input costs, lower energy costs. Are you seeing any more sequential declines as we head into the second half of the year on those costs?James F. BrunkYes. So Keith, if you kind of step back sequentially, if you look Q1 to Q2, inflation or deflation, was about $55 million from Q1 to Q2, which offset the reductions in price and mix of about $36 million, which helped us expand the margins as the cost declined. Now I would expect to see, as we go through the second quarter to the third quarter, also that same phenomena of lower input costs, lower inflation, helping offset the price mix again, from a sequential standpoint.OperatorOur next question comes from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research.Eric BosshardFirst of all, if we could just circle back on that comment, the path forward on cost getting better and price getting worse is -- did I interpret what you just said to say that the savings and inputs more than paid for the impact or pressure from price mix. Am I saying that right?James F. BrunkYes. Sequentially is what I was focused on is from Q1 to Q2, you saw that. From Q2 to Q3, we expect the same to occur. Again, that's sequentially. It's very -- it's an interesting year where looking at sequential changes are actually more important. You can see the flow through quicker as the lower cost material and energy offsetting the pressure on price mix.Eric BosshardAnd then secondly, I guess, related to that and somewhat answered within that statement, the -- Jeff, you talked a good bit kind of globally about price mix pressure either related to demand or influenced by what's going on with inputs. In terms of what you're seeing from consumers or your customers, is that path a steady one per the comment that was just made? Is it increasing? Is it stabilizing? Just trying to figure what the slope of that curve looks like?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumI mean it's being caused by the low utilization rates in a different depending on geography and product category. To remind you, the industry, all the different pieces are -- tend to be highly capital-intense with high fixed costs. So the participants tend to try to maximize volume to cover the overhead. With the energy and material are declining, and we're tending to pass through the majority of that to the customers. At the same time, you have a mix change that's going on with, as we said before, the retail has higher margins. And as the retail is declining more, it's impacting the margins and average prices as well.Eric BosshardOkay. And then the last, Jeff, you spoke to it today and was in the release about signs of a bottom and hoping for a bottom as well. And I guess I look at the channel, the retailers taking inventory out would suggest their position more conservative. In normal cycles do, I guess historically, we would look to see that inventories would increase and mix would get better, and that would be a sign of a more bullish consumer. What should we be watching for if it's not inventories and price mix to suggest more bullishness from either your customers or the end consumers about better demand?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumI guess to begin with -- we're hoping that the demand is maybe at a bottom for the cycle. But as you said, the cycle is not exactly typical of prior ones. Unusual to have the employment remaining strong and our category be so pressured, which it is this time. The whole housing market is totally different than prior ones. And so you see right now, the housing is starting to -- the new starts are going up. It's going to take 4 to 9 months for us to see that depending upon which house and how long it flows through before we see that.On the longer-term side, when people's confidence, historically, the consumer confidence is also a good indicator of when they start spending more money because as that goes up, they'll start taking these postponed projects that they have and doing them. So far, the commercial is still holding up. We're assuming it's going to weaken as we go through the fall, but we'll have to see how it goes. So far, the index or the billing index for the architects doesn't show it declining yet, but we're anticipating it's going to get weaker.OperatorOur next question comes from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs.Susan Marie MaklariTo start with, when we think about your third quarter guide, can you help us walk through each of the segments and how we should be thinking about the sequential changes coming through from a seasonality perspective in terms of the top line as well as the margins?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumYes. I think Jim and I, I think both of us to do that one for you. In the third quarter, everybody didn't look like they built in the European decline that we always have. And given the vacation they take, our volumes over there drop and our margins dropped as well. We expect lower industry volumes will continue pressuring pricing and mix across the whole industry. And at this time, we're not building in any catalyst for remodeling to improve. At some point, it will, but we don't have it in any of our expectations at this point.The period will continue to benefit from lower material and energy costs as well as our restructuring actions. We're going to keep controlling the inventory relative to the demand. We've talked a few times about the retail margins impacting our mix. And then we also think that the currency changes have been going on, it could have an impact of another $5 million to $15 million just in the currency changes. Jim, do you want to sort of give up between the different segments?James F. BrunkSo Flooring Rest of the World, obviously, is most exposed to the European holidays. So from -- again, sequentially from Q2 to Q3, you would expect to see a margin decline in their business. Global Ceramic has some exposure to Europe, but the largest component and piece of that segment is the U.S. So margins from Q2 to Q3 could be flat to slightly down. And then in Flooring North America, usually Q3 is one of their strongest quarters. So we expect to see margin expansion from Q2 to Q3.Susan Marie MaklariOkay. That's very helpful color. And then perhaps as we think about 2024, as that approaches, understanding that it's hard to understand where the global macros will go and some of these demand factors. But when you think about all the cost actions that you have taken across the business in the last, call it, 3 or 4 years. You think about some of the capacity changes that you've made in there as well. Any thoughts, Jeff, on how the business can perform across the different end markets and segments that you have at some sort of a level?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumFirst, I don't think I'm capable of calling the turn. I don't know when it's going to happen, it will happen. It usually follows the interest rates peaking and starting to fall. And I don't know if that's going to happen at the end of this year or sometime the end of next year, or anywhere in between. With that, the next year, all of the things you mentioned is right. We should have, as we talked about before, the volume should jump significantly. Usually, you have significant increase in the industry volume making up for the decreases that we've had as you come out. We think the margins will expand in all the businesses.Typically, the sales also go up further because our suppliers start raising our costs, and we pass those through. So those help the top line further and you have an expansion of the volume and expansion of selling prices and then you have the margins expanding as the leverage in the businesses go. This time, we also have more capacity in what we think are going to be the high-growth areas for our business. And then again, we should have -- there's going to be very limited accretion in the acquisitions until the business turn. But when it turns, we should have the cost take out. We should have restructured the product portfolios, and those should be ready to expand. So we're expecting a significant improvement as we come out of this.OperatorOur next question comes from Laura Champine from Loop Capital.Laura Allyson ChampineFirst on the Ceramic business. Your press release calls out inflation. I'm assuming that's year-on-year. Is that just flowing through the higher cost inventories? Are you still seeing product cost inflation for that segment?William Christopher WellbornNo. Energy has started to come down. So what you're seeing in the third quarter is the flow-through of the higher cost inventory that we had.Laura Allyson ChampineAnd is this the last quarter where you would expect to see that impact?William Christopher WellbornI think most of it will be finished through the -- after the third quarter.Laura Allyson ChampineAfter the third quarter. Got it. And then on CapEx, there's language in the press release about sort of being careful on projects and needing a serious return. However, the budget doesn't seem to have shifted. So maybe what did change, if anything, this quarter versus last on your CapEx plans?James F. BrunkWell, we're very focused on investing to optimize the future of the business. The growth investments that we talked about, they make up about -- almost about $250 million of the 2023 budget depending on timing. Maintenance CapEx for the business is roughly $200 million, $250 million as well. Now we're also focused the balance really is on the quick kind of return projects on cost reductions, our focus on product innovation and then also some projects on acquisitions. What we were speaking about is now looking forward into next year about being very, I guess, diligent looking at the CapEx budget for next year.Laura Allyson ChampineGot it. And is it too early to give us kind of a first look on the direction there?James F. BrunkYes, it's a little bit early, but we're working with all the teams as we speak.OperatorOur next question comes from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research.Truman Andrew PattersonClearly, you all have been pretty open about increased pricing competition globally. Do you think you could discuss just some of the big buckets where you're seeing this occur either product category or region as well as perhaps how this has evolved versus your expectations through the year?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumSure. So in the U.S., you have with the decline in import prices, which affect both LVT and ceramic. So those are moving down, and we're adjusting as we have to do those. Some of that is impacting our margins as we have higher cost inventory. In our European business, our Ceramic businesses, they've been at very low levels. So the marketplace is getting very aggressive trying to run the assets that are there. So the market pricing there is under pressure.In our Flooring business in Europe, it's more of a mix problem than a pricing problem. On the other hand, you have growth in the lower cost product categories. So we're bringing people down rather than lowering prices. And then our panels and insulation businesses tend to go up and down with the material and energy prices, and those are being passed through as they occur.Truman Andrew PattersonOkay. Perfectly. And then in North America, with oil coming down quite a bit, understood. If I look at your margins kind of sequentially, it seems like that raw material deflation versus pricing benefit probably occurred in North America, a little bit more than some of the other regions. But could you help us think through what's built into your third quarter guide regarding raws in the North American segment specifically?James F. BrunkWell, in Flooring North America, similar to the other segments, from Q1 to Q2, you're absolutely right. We're starting to see sequentially the benefit of the lower cost coming through, not only in raw materials, but in energy as well. In our view of Q2 to Q3, we still see some of that, maybe a slower pace sequentially, but you still get a benefit of lower cost in raw material, energy and also freight as you look in the U.S. as well. So those are the assumptions around Flooring North America.OperatorThe next question comes from John Lovallo of UBS.John LovalloJust want to make sure I have the cadence right here on the input cost inflation and price mix. So in terms of the input cost inflation, it looks like sequentially, we'll see improvement in the third quarter. Should we expect sort of a leveling off as we move into the fourth quarter? And should the third quarter and fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis be improved? And then in the price mix, are we still expecting sequential deterioration as we move through the third quarter and the fourth quarter?James F. BrunkYes. So John, you've kind of asked 2 different time periods there. So let me tackle sequentially first. So again, sequentially, from Q1 to Q2, we benefited where you had lower cost versus the impact of lowering price and mix. I would expect a similar occurrence albeit maybe a less impact, but a similar occurrence in Q2 to Q3 and also in Q3 to Q4. Again, that's sequentially. Now year-over-year, you're absolutely right. What we've said is that we have a tailwind in the back half of the year, again, year-over-year from lower materials and lower energy. But price mix and the pressure on both will continue in the third and fourth quarter. The gap from a year-over-year perspective will close by the end of the year, but it will still exist from a little bit.John LovalloOkay. That's helpful. And then on the $17 million in restructuring charges that will generate the $35 million in annual savings, are those related to headcount? I'm just curious how -- it sounds like the savings are going to come through pretty quickly here. And if that is the case, I mean, are you at all concerned that could negatively impact your ability to react if activity does pick up a little faster than anticipated?James F. BrunkNo. These actions are really focused around headcount reductions, as you said, in both administrative and manufacturing functions along with some consolidation of distribution points. So most of that cash is -- will occur in the third, fourth quarter of this year.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.Michael Jason RehautSo just wanted to make sure I understood right in terms of your prior comments. If you kind of think about price mix versus cost. Just want to make sure I'm understanding that it sounds like you're saying will be negative in the next 2 quarters, but perhaps that negative gap moderating or lessening as you get to the fourth quarter versus the third. Is that the right way to think about it?James F. BrunkIf you're speaking about it from a year-over-year perspective, that is a correct statement. The benefit and the lower cost compared to the pressure on price and mix, that differential will lessen we anticipate as we move through the balance of the year. That's why, Mike, I think, sequentially is so important to look at because you see more in real time, the benefit of the lower cost offsetting the impact of price mix.Michael Jason RehautRight. And then -- but at the same time, it sounds like at least for the third quarter, you've pointed to that historical seasonality kicking in where on a broad basis, inclusive of even price cost. But on a broad basis, you're looking for margins to decline on a consolidated basis in 3Q versus 2Q. And it would sound that even if the price cost gap is narrowing in 4Q on a year-over-year, I would assume you're still expecting, again, consistent with the typical seasonality you're expecting in the 3Q further sequential margin contraction in 4Q. Is that fair to say?James F. BrunkWell, Mike, it really first of all, it depends on that demand cycle, what we talked about. And from a fourth quarter perspective, yes, you'll have seasonally lower production with Christmas vacations. The industry volume, though may be at a bottom, the pricing pressure could continue. Higher cost inventory by then should relatively be consumed, as Chris indicated earlier. We do have a bump, as you well heard and seen on new home construction, which could help us increase Flooring sales. We have the restructuring that's going to benefit our cost structures. And last year, as I noted earlier, we included much more shutdowns than normal, so that should help us in the fourth quarter as well.Jeffrey S. LorberbaumWe're also, as we've said before, anticipating commercial to weaken somewhat as we go through the year. That we'll have to see. Hopefully, we're wrong.Michael Jason RehautRight. And maybe just one last quick one. The Italian subsidies, does that end right on June -- at the end of 2Q? And if you could just quantify what that meant on a quarterly basis?James F. BrunkYes. So as we've said before, it's about $15 million to $20 million per quarter. The government did stop it at the end of the second quarter, but it will flow through my inventory into my P&amp;L. So I'll get some benefit at a lower level in Q3 and then by Q4, it's basically gone.Jeffrey S. LorberbaumBut the energy prices have continued to drop without those. So they were making up for high energy costs, so the energy costs have dropped substantially. So the difference will not be dramatic.James F. BrunkYes. So with that lower cost, we are expecting to be aligned with the competition as well.OperatorThe next question comes from Mike Dahl of the Royal Bank of Canada.Michael Glaser DahlSorry to beat the horse a little bit on the pricing comments. It seems like the sequential versus year-on-year is obviously that we are just given the magnitude of all the changes. But it would seem like on a year-on-year basis, your cost tailwinds should step up significantly in 4Q versus 3Q, again, on a year-on-year basis. I just want to make sure I heard correctly that even in 4Q, you're still assuming that the price cost is slightly negative. And then I guess, how do we think about -- kind of an exit rate, do you think you'll get back to neutral by year-end as you think about kind of '24 planning? Or -- because it seems to imply still some sequential price decline through the year or accelerating declines there, I should say.James F. BrunkSo let me kick that off, Mike. So you're absolutely right. The benefit from a year-over-year perspective should peak -- in terms of this year should peak in the fourth quarter. That's why I said the gap will close significantly between the inflation and price mix. It's very difficult at this point to say it's going to be flat, slightly negative, but we'll have to see as the pricing evolves and the mix over the balance of the year. But certainly, the inflation gets -- or the lower cost flowing through the P&amp;L gets much more substantial in the fourth quarter.Michael Glaser DahlGot it. Okay. And then my second question is just related to kind of the LVT [and poor] dynamics and some of the puts and takes around the Forced Labor Act. Can you just -- you mentioned it in the opening comments, but just elaborate a little bit more on kind of how you've seen that evolve and whether supply chains have shifted enough and you've gotten product on port or competition has gotten product into ports? Just what's the update on that?William Christopher WellbornYes. We're seeing market pressures increasing with lower volumes and declining freight. Higher cost inventories, reducing our margin as it flows through. We also have -- our West Coast operations will be in the start-up phase at the end of the year, but that Forced Labor Act is still impacting some of the sales and timing of our new introductions.Jeffrey S. LorberbaumIt is stopping product from coming in. They seem to be doing it on an individual business supplier base. They keep adding to it over time. It has stopped shipments from coming in. We, in particular, stopped hours. It's impacted our service level on existing sales. And it's also impacted our new product introductions, which got stopped. It's difficult to tell how it's going to evolve.OperatorOur next question comes from Stephen Kim of Evercore.Stephen KimAppreciate the color. My line cut out a couple of times, so apologies if this was happened, I don't think it was. But I wanted to ask you about the impact or the benefit we can anticipate when volume ultimately returns. I know you're not giving a specific time frame for when that will be, but when it does occur inevitably, I'm curious about what we might see from productivity and temp shutdowns, in particular. Regarding productivity, we've usually seen a positive boost to your EBIT from productivity when volumes rising. But recently, you've actually generated positive productivity when volume was going down. And so I'm curious, when volume ultimately inflect up, is it reasonable to think that we could still get positive productivity year-on-year?And then similarly, with temp shutdowns, you mentioned, I think, that in 4Q, shutdowns, you won't have shutdowns, but it will be less than the prior year. What I'm interpreting that to be is that you're going to get an EBIT benefit year-on-year from reduced shutdown. So when you move forward and volume picks up, I assume you won't have any shutdowns. And so that should also be a benefit on top of whatever volume benefit you would get. I just want to make sure that both of those are true.Jeffrey S. LorberbaumYes, they are all true as the utilization of the factories goes up, that will reduce the fixed overhead costs. Usually, the productivity of the plants also increases as well. We usually get leverage in the sales cost as well as it all turns. And then somewhere along the line as it goes in, we'll start raising prices as our suppliers start trying to expand their margins as we go forward. So all those things occur.Stephen KimYes. Great. That's -- yes, we look forward to that day. All right. So the second question for me is in ceramic, we've seen over the years or so, we've seen a pretty big rise in ceramic imports from India. You all have obviously moved stepped into LatAm pretty significantly, Brazil, Mexico, et cetera. And I'm curious if you could help us understand, are there any salient differences either in product quality or other costs of doing business that favor Latin America for -- as a place to import for you or ship products to the U.S. from versus other parts of Asia?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumJust as a comment before he answers that one. The -- our investments in Latin America are primarily for the Latin American markets is it. We do ship some into the United States, but the majority of it is for the local markets. Chris, do you want to answer for the rest?William Christopher WellbornThe other thing I would say, Stephen, is that the -- from India right now, the freight rates are really low, which we don't think are sustainable. But in the U.S., we've done a lot of work on our mid and premium product to reduce the impact of the changes in that imported product.Jeffrey S. LorberbaumBut right now, India does have an advantage with freight.OperatorOur next question comes from Matthew Bouley of Barclays.Matthew Adrien BouleyI think you mentioned a few times that commercial has been outperforming, but that you expected commercial to weaken later this year. I guess, how is that dynamic evolving for you specifically? You're actually starting to see signs of, I don't know, weakening orders in the commercial end market? And just how might you expect that to play out from a volume and price perspective?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumFirst, you have to go back to other cycles. I've never seen a cycle where the commercial business didn't fall off, and it usually falls off about a year after the other one. So it's possible you get through this without it, but hard to believe. So there is some indications of some weakening new projects being started and new orders. So we're going to have to see how it evolves, there's a chance that could keep going through it. But at least in our expectation we're assuming there's going to be some weakening show up.Matthew Adrien BouleyGot it. Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, on the $35 million of savings actions. I think you said half would be realized this year. I mean, should we assume that you're kind of reaching the run rate really in Q4, or are you already starting to realize a lot of that in Q3? How does that kind of phase between the next 2 quarters?James F. BrunkIt's fairly split between Q3 and Q4. I would say, by the run rate, you're correct is you will see it as we get through Q4.OperatorThe next question comes from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman.Adam Michael BaumgartenJust curious if you could walk through where you're seeing the biggest negative mix impacts across the various products and geographies?James F. BrunkRight now, in the second quarter, the price mix was unfavorable from a year-over-year perspective. And the largest part in the second quarter was in Flooring North America and LVT with the pricing declines driven by imports.Adam Michael BaumgartenOkay. Got it. And then just as we think about the restructuring actions, maybe how to think about that across the various segments as you spread it across the different businesses?James F. BrunkWell, if you back up a little bit. So we announced in 2022 and Q2 and Q4, restructuring actions that you should see as we go through this year and the next about $60 million, that was mainly split between Flooring North America and Flooring Rest of the world as they took out higher-cost assets around reducing work production, phasing out the residential flexible LVT in Europe as well as some other initiatives. And then this current action that we just announced is fairly spread between Flooring North America and Global Ceramic.OperatorThe next question comes from Rafe Jadrosich of Bank of America.Rafe Jason JadrosichWhen you look at the dealers that you sell through in the U.S., sort of the smaller independent ones, just can you talk about the health of that sort of network? Obviously, like the industry sales have been under pressure, and I'm sure they're sitting on some -- or they were sitting on some high cost inventory and prices have come down. How is like the health of that retail channel for you? And are you seeing any consolidation there?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumThe -- most of the retailers have been able to -- you go through the last year, they were able to pass through the costs. They were able to pass through the higher labor installation rates. And in some cases, many of their margins expanded is it. So for the most part, most of them are in fairly good shape at this point.Rafe Jason JadrosichOkay. That's good to hear. And then the second question was just on -- as pricing comes down with the lower input costs like you're talking about in the second half here, what have you historically seen in terms of volumes with lower pricing? Like what is the demand elasticity to price? Do you ever get an uptick in volumes because the pricing is lower?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumUsually in these environments, we're lowering prices in reaction to the marketplace and to people start taking -- trying to take isolated pieces and increasing their share. And then as you would suspect, the other participants are trying to hold their share. So typically, as prices decline, we passed through much of the lower cost to our customers as we're all trying to run at that.Rafe Jason JadrosichIs this pricing competitive environment different than other like is it kind of a similar level that you would have anticipated, like more competitive, less competitive than what you've seen historically?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumI think it's probably typical. The difference will be in Europe. You have a much lower environment. And so I think in Europe, it might be more aggressive than historical. But also the costs were up higher, much higher in Europe, too, you have both dynamics.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jeff Lorberbaum for any closing remarks.Jeffrey S. LorberbaumWe'd like to thank everyone for joining us. We are focused on managing the short term, and we think we're well positioning the business to maximize the long-term growth in earnings. Thank you again.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may begin.Andy TaylorThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2023 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.Story continuesDevin W. StockfishThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $230 million or $0.31 per diluted share on net sales of $2 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $238 million or $0.32 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $469 million in the second quarter. This is a 19% increase from the first quarter and was largely driven by an increase in wood products' commodity pricing and strong EWP sales volumes. Notwithstanding elevated mortgage rates, we've been encouraged by resilient demand for new homes this year, which provided a nice tailwind for our Wood Products business in the second quarter. We delivered solid results in the quarter, and I'd like to thank our teams for their collective efforts and focus on safety, operational excellence and continuing to serve our customers. Before moving into our business results, I'd like to comment briefly on a timberlands transaction we completed earlier this month. As we reported yesterday, we acquired 22,000 acres of high-quality timberlands in Mississippi for approximately $60 million. This acquisition is comprised of highly productive timberlands strategically located to deliver immediate synergies with existing Weyerhaeuser timber and mill operations. With a mature age class and well stock timber inventory, we expect these timberlands to generate strong cash yields. Additionally, the acquisition offers incremental real estate and natural climate solutions opportunities in the future. This transaction is a great example of our ongoing efforts to enhance our portfolio with high-quality, well-managed timberlands that generate solid returns for our shareholders. As highlighted on Page 22 of our earnings slides, we continue to make great progress against our target to grow our timberlands portfolio through $1 billion of disciplined investments between 2022 and 2025. To date, we've deployed approximately $360 million against this target, including the recent Mississippi transaction and the acquisitions in the Carolinas and Washington, which were completed in 2022. Turning now to our second quarter business results, starting with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $104 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $172 million, a $16 million decrease compared to the first quarter. This was largely driven by lower average sales realizations for export logs in the West. Turning to the Western domestic market. Favorable weather conditions during the quarter supported increased log supply across the region. Log demand improved as mills returned to more normalized operating levels in response to strengthening lumber prices and later in the quarter, took precautionary measures to bolster log inventories ahead of wildfire season. These dynamics kept log prices fairly stable during the second quarter, and as a result, our average domestic sales realizations were comparable to the first quarter. Our fee harvest volumes were slightly higher than the first quarter as a result of favorable operating conditions. Domestic sales volumes were significantly higher as we intentionally shifted logs to the domestic customers to capture higher-margin opportunities. Per unit log and haul costs improved in the second quarter and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher. Moving to our Western export business. In Japan, log markets continued to soften in the second quarter in response to elevated inventories of European lumber imports as well as lower consumption driven by reduced post-and-beam housing activity. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were lower compared to the first quarter, and our sales volumes were comparable. As we look forward, we expect European lumber inventories in Japan to normalize in the coming months, which should increase demand for our Douglas fir logs into the Japanese market later in the year.In China, log markets softened in the second quarter in response to an influx of log supply from New Zealand combined with the reduction in log takeaway at the ports. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to China were lower compared to the first quarter. Our sales volumes were significantly lower as we intentionally flex logs to the domestic market.Turning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands was $79 million, a slight reduction compared to the first quarter. Southern sawlog markets remained fairly balanced in the second quarter as log supply improved with drier conditions and mills bolstered log inventories following weather-related challenges in the first quarter. In contrast, Southern fiber markets softened in response to elevated inventories of logs and finished goods at mills as well as lower overall demand for pulp and paper end market -- end products. Given favorable operating conditions, our thinning activity increased in the second quarter, resulting in a higher mix of fiber logs.As a result, our average sales realizations were slightly lower compared to the first quarter, and our fee harvest volumes were comparable. Per unit log and haul costs were slightly lower, primarily due to lower fuel prices, and forestry and road costs were seasonably higher. In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $4 million compared to the first quarter due to significantly lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring breakup conditions.Turning now to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $52 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $70 million, a $19 million decrease compared to the first quarter, largely driven by the timing and mix of properties sold. Average price per acre increased significantly in the second quarter and remains elevated compared to historical levels. We continue to benefit from healthy demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.I'll now make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. We continue to make progress on our forest carbon pilot project in May. In the second quarter, we completed the third-party audit process and submitted the project to the American Carbon Registry for final approval. Once approved, we expect an initial issuance of approximately 30,000 credits in year 1, and we're currently developing 2 additional projects in the U.S. South. We remain focused on positioning our credits to capture the highest value possible in the marketplace.Moving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products generated $218 million of earnings in the second quarter and $270 million of adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter EBITDA was an 82% improvement from the first quarter, largely driven by an increase in lumber and OSB sales realizations and strong sales volumes for engineered wood products. Starting with lumber. Adjusted EBITDA was $51 million in the second quarter, a $43 million increase over the prior quarter and largely driven by improved sales realizations. Benchmark pricing for lumber held fairly stable in April and May as sentiment remained cautious. Buyers mostly limited orders to necessity purchases despite lean inventories. By mid-June, overall sentiment and benchmark pricing improved in response to stronger housing activity. Perceived risk to supply from Canadian wildfires and announced mill curtailments also bolstered buying activity in June. Over the quarter, the framing lumber composite was comparable to the first quarter while our average sales realizations increased by 6% with the relative outperformance driven by our regional mix and product mix. Our sales volumes were moderately higher compared to the first quarter as our Northwest mills returned to more normalized operating levels. Log costs were slightly lower, primarily for Western logs and unit manufacturing costs were slightly higher during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for OSB increased by $15 million compared to the first quarter, primarily due to the increase in commodity pricing, slightly offset by higher unit manufacturing costs related to planned and unplanned downtime. Benchmark pricing for OSB entered the second quarter on an upward trajectory, largely driven by lean inventories and steady demand from new home construction activity. As the quarter progressed, buyer sentiment and benchmark pricing continued to improve as Canadian wildfires disrupted supply and in response to improving residential construction activity. As a result, the OSB composite pricing increased by 21% compared to the first quarter. Our average sales realizations increased by 11%. This relative difference was largely due to our extended order files, which result in a lag effect for OSB realizations.Our production and sales volumes were moderately lower in the second quarter and unit manufacturing costs were moderately higher due to planned downtime for annual maintenance and a temporary period of unplanned downtime related to wildfire activity near one of our facilities in Alberta. Fiber costs improved slightly during the quarter. Engineered Wood Products' adjusted EBITDA increased by $62 million or 76% compared to the first quarter. This result is directly tied to improving demand for EWP products, which are primarily used in single-family home building applications. As a result, our production and sales volumes were significantly higher for most products in the second quarter and unit manufacturing costs improved significantly for Solid Section and I-Joist products. That said, our average sales realizations were lower for most products as supply and demand continue to rebalance across the broader EWP market. It's worth noting that our current EWP prices remain above pre-pandemic levels. Raw material costs decreased for all products in the second quarter.In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased by $12 million compared to the first quarter, a 55% improvement as the business benefited from strong EWP sales volumes in the second quarter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook.David M. WoldThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I will be covering key financial items and second quarter financial performance before moving into our third quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16.We generated $496 million of cash from operations in the second quarter and ended the period with approximately $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Total debt at quarter end was approximately $5.8 billion. In May, we took advantage of attractive capital market conditions and issued $750 million of debt due in 2026 and a coupon of 4.75%. This debt issuance prefunded the majority of our 2023 maturities. And due to the shape of the yield curve, we were able to reinvest these cash proceeds in the interim at interest rates in excess of the bond coupon. As a result of this transaction, our full year 2023 interest expense will increase by $10 million to approximately $280 million. That said, this increase will be more than offset by the interest income earned on the invested issuance proceeds.In mid-July, we used a portion of the debt issuance proceeds to repay our $118 million, 7% or an 8% note at maturity, and we intend to use the remainder of issuance proceeds towards our December 2023 maturity. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $81 million. We returned $139 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend, which was increased in the first quarter by 5.6% to $0.19 per share. In addition, we returned $50 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity in the second quarter. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $29.59 and as of quarter, (inaudible) $1 billion authorization.Looking forward, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. As highlighted on Page 18, adjusted funds available for distribution for the second quarter totaled $415 million, and we have generated $470 million of adjusted FAD year-to-date. Looking forward, key outlook items for the third quarter are presented on Page 19. In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $25 million lower than the second quarter of 2023. Turning to our Western Timberlands operations. Domestic log demand was steady at the outset of the third quarter in response to improved pricing and take away of lumber and as mills continue to build inventories ahead of wildfire season. That said, absent fire-related disruptions in the region, log supply is expected to remain ample as the quarter progresses, largely driven by a seasonal influx of logs from nontraditional timber owners. As a result, our domestic sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower compared to the second quarter. As is typical during the warmer and dryer months, we have transitioned in a higher elevation operations, which generally have lower productivity.As a result, our fee harvest volumes will be moderately lower in the third quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher as we do a significant amount of this work during the summer months, and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be lower, partly due to a decrease in fuel prices.Moving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, elevated inventories of European lumber imports and reduced consumption continue to weigh on the Japanese log market. That said, we anticipate our Japanese sales volumes will increase compared to the second quarter due to the timing of vessels, and we expect our sales realizations to be comparable. In China, elevated log imports from New Zealand and reduced log consumption continued to have an impact on the Chinese log market. We expect these conditions to persist through the third quarter. As a result, our sales realizations into China are expected to be lower compared to the second quarter, and we anticipate our sales volumes will be significantly lower as we flex logs to domestic customers to capture higher-margin opportunities.In the South, we expect sawlog markets to moderate somewhat in the third quarter and fiber markets to soften further. This is being driven by a seasonal increase in log supply, elevated mill inventories and softening demand, particularly for pulp and paper products. That said, takeaway for our logs is expected to remain steady given our delivered programs across the region. Our fee harvest volumes are expected to be comparable to the second quarter and will include a higher mix of fiber logs as increased spinning activity continues. With a higher percentage of fiber logs, we expect our sales realizations to be slightly lower compared to the second quarter.Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be comparable and forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher. In the North, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher compared to the second quarter as we have fully transitioned from spring breakup conditions, and our sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower due to mix.Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Demand for our real estate properties remain steady, and we continue to anticipate a consistent flow of HBU transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the third quarter, we expect earnings will be slightly higher and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million higher than the second quarter of 2023 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For the full year, we continue to anticipate adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million for the segment and now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 35% to 40% for the year.For our Wood Products segment, benchmark prices for lumber and OSB entered the third quarter on an upward trajectory, supported by improving demand, relatively lean inventories and the prospects of supply disruptions following an early start to wildfire season in Canada. As shown on Page 21, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber and OSB are well above the second quarter averages. Assuming this pricing dynamic remains intact for the balance of the third quarter, we expect our Wood Products' financial results to be significantly higher compared to the second quarter of 2023. That said, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB, we anticipate third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly lower than last quarter. For our lumber business, we expect moderately higher production and sales volumes in the third quarter and slightly lower unit manufacturing costs. Log costs are expected to be moderately lower compared to the second quarter. For our oriented strand board business, we expect production and sales volumes to be comparable to the second quarter. Unit manufacturing costs are expected to be slightly higher and fiber costs are expected to be comparable.Turning to our Engineered Wood Products business. As Devin mentioned, we continue to see improving demand for EWP products, and this has extended our order activity well into the third quarter. As a result, we expect our sales volumes to increase slightly compared to the second quarter. Notwithstanding this dynamic, we anticipate slightly lower sales realizations as supply and demand continue to rebalance in certain markets. That said, third quarter EWP prices are expected to remain substantially above pre-pandemic levels, and we'll continue to adjust in response to demand signals from the homebuilding segment, which has seen more strength of late, particularly for single-family construction.Raw material costs are expected to be higher compared to the second quarter, primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the second quarter. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.Devin W. StockfishThanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Our view on the housing market has become incrementally more positive over the last several months, supported by improvements in homebuilder sentiment and increase in new home sales and an uptick in single-family starts. Despite elevated mortgage rates, we continue to see resilient demand from the homebuilding segment, largely driven by the historically low inventory of existing homes, a strong labor market and solid household balance sheets. That being said, there continues to be a degree of uncertainty around the trajectory of mortgage rates in the broader U.S. economy.As a result, we still expect housing starts in 2023 to be lower than the last couple of years. But again, our outlook has become more positive as the year has progressed, and there may be incremental upside if mortgage rates move down from the high 6% range. And longer term, we remain quite optimistic on housing fundamentals, supported by favorable demographic trends and a significantly underbuilt housing stock.Turning to the repair and remodel market. Activity strengthened slightly in the second quarter and has held up well year-to-date, largely supported by solid demand from the professional segment. Demand from the do-it-yourself segment was steady in the second quarter and is largely normalized to pre-pandemic levels. Near term, we expect stable demand from this segment as prospective homebuyers may choose to remodel in lieu of purchasing a new home in a higher mortgage rate environment. And longer term, we continue to believe the repair and remodel market will be an important demand driver for our businesses, supported by strong home equity levels and an aging housing stock.In closing, our teams delivered solid operational and financial results in the second quarter. In addition, we continue to make meaningful progress against the multiyear targets we set out in 2021 through strategic Timberlands' acquisitions and the advancement of our forest carbon business. Looking ahead, we're encouraged by recent improvements in the housing market and maintain a favorable long-term outlook for the demand fundamentals that will drive growth for our businesses. We remain focused on operational excellence and innovation, driving industry-leading margins and supporting our customers. And with our strong financial position, our unmatched portfolio of assets and disciplined approach to capital allocation, we're well positioned to drive long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I think we can go ahead and open it up for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America.George Leon StaphosI want to start off on SG&amp;A, and I guess, relatedly, all things you're doing to manage costs at the company. Your cost management, at least from our vantage point, has been commendable. Again, year-to-date SG&amp;A really hasn't moved much. Are there any cost pressures, though that as you're looking now to '24, '25 that you'll need to manage against that or maybe building and we'll see a little bit more movement to the upside there in future years? What do you think about that?Devin W. StockfishYes. I mean, first of all, I say thanks for the recognition, George. As you know, this is work that we've been doing day in, day out for a number of years to stay focused on cost. And it's a never-ending journey to keep control on costs and particularly over the last few years with all of the inflationary pressures. I think in terms of what we're doing on a day-to-day basis, it's just incorporated into our planning and our operations to daily focus on keeping our costs down. I think we are seeing, from an overall inflationary standpoint, not specific to SG&amp;A, but just overall, we are seeing some of our cost pressures starting to wane a little bit; fuel, energy, resin, waxes, things of that nature. But on the SG&amp;A front, labor costs, those are sticky and those inflationary pressures are something that we continue to have to manage.In terms of the primary focus areas over the next several years, I think it's largely more of the same. I think labor costs will continue to be something that we'll have to manage closely. But beyond that, I think it's a lot of the same things that we've been doing over the last several years. I don't know, Davie, would you like to add anything to that?David M. WoldSure, Devin. I would just point out that this goes back to everything we've been doing for a number of years on OpEx. And as we look forward, our focus on OpEx and continuing into innovation, and everything we're working on every day, we expect that to be a lever for us over time to continue to manage costs and drive those down into the future.George Leon StaphosOkay. Two follow-ons and I'll turn it over very quickly. So given what's been a nice pickup in demand over the course of the year in Wood Products, recognizing it wasn't so strong earlier in the year, are timber prices in the South for sawlogs where you would have expected them given that backdrop, why aren't we seeing more lift recognizing, again, it's a market by market, very local market, but are timber prices in the South for sawlogs, where you would have expected given the backdrop, why or why not? And then can you give us a bit more color in terms of the normalization, the factors that you're seeing in supply/demand in EWP, particularly in Trus Joist and why we're not seeing more of a lift higher given the favorable single-family outlook?Devin W. StockfishSure. Well, I'll start with the sawlog question in the South. And I think we've seen over the last several years, some uplift on sawlog pricing. And we've been talking about this for a long time, a lot of new capacity coming into the South and certainly, what we've seen in those geographies where we've had new capacity or expanded capacity, we have seen those markets tension and we've seen upward pressure on pricing. I think this year, there are a few things going on. For the first half of the year, I think sawlog prices held up pretty well, at least in the markets that we participate in. I think unlike the fiber logs, which have seen a little bit more pressure just because of what's going on in the pulp and paper industry, the sawlog market has held up pretty well. I think there is a nuance going on there with respect to the availability of transportation. One of the things that we saw over the last couple of years was just a real shortage of trucking capacity. And I think that put a little bit of an uplift on pricing just as mills, particularly strong lumber markets. We're making sure that they had adequate log decks. As that trucking capacity has loosened a little bit, I think some of that pressure has come off. As we think about where we are in the year, it's not a typical to see a little downward pressure on log prices just because in the summer months, and the drier weather, you have more supply hitting the market. So that's the dynamic at play. I do think over time and again, just going back to my point earlier, as we see capacity continuing to come into the region, you are going to see continued pressure and tensioning across the South. So I think the trajectory is still what we had expected. And certainly, I think we're optimistic over the next several years as these mills continue to come into the region that you'll see continued upward price pressure. You'll have ups and downs seasonally like we always do, but the overall trajectory, I think, still looks positive.With respect to your question around EWP, I think if you really want to understand what's going on today, you have to look back a couple of quarters and just think about the trajectory of what's happened. As we got into late last year and early 2023, we had a fair bit of destocking going on. So you combine that with the lower residential construction activity and it really put the EWP market in a softer place earlier in this year. And so that was really the story in Q1. As you remember, we did dial back our production in EWP to address that. I think we have a pretty good customer base. We have a strong product. And so as that market started to recover, there was good demand for our product. And we certainly saw that over the course of Q2 moving into Q3, but the reality is, in Q1 and Q2, just as those markets rebalanced, we had to take pricing action as everyone else did, just to make sure that we were competitive in each individual market.There's generally a time lag in terms of those pricing actions, whether you're raising prices or lowering prices. And so some of what you're seeing in Q3 is just the lag effect of pricing actions that we had to take earlier in the year. I would say, on balance, the market is recovering nicely. Our order files are back to the place where they're fairly extended. We're even on allocation for a few products at this point. So the market is stabilizing, but each individual market has its own dynamics, and we'll make pricing action where necessary to make sure we're competitive. But I think directionally, we feel pretty good about where EWP is and the trends that we've seen lately.OperatorOur next question is from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.Kurt Willem YingerGreat. I know it wasn't a huge impact for you guys in the quarter, but can you just talk about some of the derivative impacts from the wildfires up in Canada and in terms of just operating your facilities there, logistics and transportation and the role that has perhaps played in and some of the pricing strength that we've seen in the last 2 to 3 months?Devin W. StockfishSure. Well, I'll give you an update on our operations, specifically and then mention more or less the impact that it had on pricing in the market. So in terms of the impact to us, we had 2 of our 3 mills in Alberta that were impacted. We had a lumber mill and our OSB mill that both had to take about 2 weeks downtime each as the fires caused evacuations in those local communities. And so the net impact to us from a financial standpoint was relatively minor, sub $4 million for the quarter. I think the bigger impact, though, as you mentioned, was just with all of the fire activity, it did cause some concern around supply, particularly, I think, on the lumber side. And I suspect that was part of what drove some of the pricing activity to the upside in lumber as we got into June and early parts of July. So I think the real impact was on the overall lumber market and just kind of the concerns around supply availability with the fires. I would say from a transportation standpoint, it did obviously have some impact, but I would say, not material.Kurt Willem YingerGot it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just 2 quick ones. First, could you talk about what you're hearing and seeing in terms of European lumber imports into the U.S. kind of for the back half of the year as well as on the timberland side, the pipeline of opportunities that you see and just kind of your outlook in terms of potential additional bolt-on or larger scale transactions going forward?Devin W. StockfishSure. Well, with respect to European lumber, we certainly saw a higher-than-normal amount of volume coming in late last year, early part of this year. Ordinarily, I would say, European lumber volumes don't have a meaningful impact on the market. I do believe earlier in the year with the amount of volume that was coming in, particularly on the East Coast, it probably did have some impact on the supply-demand dynamic and probably push pricing down just a bit. We've seen the volumes of imports really starting to wane here over the last several months, which makes sense as the lumber prices have come down. It's less economically viable for some of that wood to come to the U.S. So our expectation is we will see lower volumes. I think you'll still have some degree of European volume coming into the market as many of those producers want to maintain that supply chain and give them the ability to flex depending on what's going on here versus in Europe, but I suspect it will be a lower volume coming in for the back half of the year. As we think about the M&amp;A market on the timberland side, as you probably have noticed, it's been lighter this year than it has been over the last few years. I think last year, you probably saw in the neighborhood of $5 billion of transaction activity. We're certainly trending much lower than that this year. And that's really, I think, largely a function of, a, probably some pull forward from last year, pretty heavy year. I think there's probably a piece of this too, that as the market is trying to figure out how to price carbon and ESG options in this space, perhaps some are holding out with the view that prices are going to continue to go up. So we'll see what the back half looks like, but we're expecting it to be a lighter year this year than it has. We're always in the market. That being said, as you saw with the Mississippi transaction, we'll continue to look at every deal that comes to market. We'll continue to have conversations with parties to see if we can do deals outside of the auction process. It's a competitive market, but I think there will be properties where we're very well suited to make those acquisitions and deliver returns for our shareholders.OperatorOur next question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.Susan Marie MaklariMy first question is, Devin, can you talk just a bit about the production levels and the inventory that you're seeing at the mills just across lumber as the builders are gearing up and adding that -- those starts on the ground. How are you thinking about overall lumber inventory out there? And maybe what could that mean for your ability to hit that 5% annual growth target that you've set out there?Devin W. StockfishYes. So the first part of the question in terms of inventories, I'd say on balance in the lumber space, inventories are on the lean side, not nearly as lean as OSB, but I'd say leaner than normal. I think what's going on right now is there is adequate supply coming on. And so people are feeling more comfortable with those lean inventories. And as you know, typically, the August time frame is a period where you see a little bit of pullback in demand, particularly on the R&amp;R side. Just because of the heat of the summer, people are less inclined to build a deck if it's 110 degrees outside.So I think you have some normal, seasonal demand pullback just on the R&amp;R side. But in terms of what that leaner inventory looks like is as you get into the fall, if buyers continue to carry lean inventories and certainly, our inventories at the mills are on the lean side as well. If you get into the fall when that R&amp;R activity picks up and you have strong single-family homebuilding, we've seen what happens there, particularly if you have some sort of supply shock maybe from fire season or some other thing happening, that can really push pricing up fairly quickly. And we saw that even just in June with the fire activity in BC, what that can do to pricing. So I think it all depends on if we see repair and remodel activity pick back up in the fall as we normally do and the builders continue to build, which is what we're expecting, that could be a nice setup for fall pricing in lumber.In terms of our ability to meet the 5%, there are going to be puts and takes every year. What we're doing is we're doing the work with building the capacity. So the CapEx projects, the improvements in reliability, et cetera, that we need to do to hit that target. Last year, obviously, we were down a little bit because of the strikes in the Northwest. This year, we did dial back production a little bit just because lumber demand has slackened a little, particularly in the Northwest and BC. So we'll see what the ultimate production number is for the year. But ultimately, we're doing the work from a capacity and an operations standpoint to support that 5% per year.Susan Marie MaklariYes. Okay. That's very helpful color. And then I guess, as you do think about some of the dynamics that are going on in the lumber market from both a supply and demand perspective, how do you think about where pricing can go as we think about the back half of this year and probably even in the first half of next year, given what the builders are talking to and looking to add on the ground. And maybe how is that different from what happened in the last few years that could either put a floor or a ceiling in terms of the upside potential around the pricing?Devin W. StockfishYes. I mean I'll offer the caveat that lumber pricing is very, very hard to predict as we've seen over the last several years. I would say, if we look back over the pandemic era, I don't know that I would necessarily look at $1,000 lumber prices as being something we're going to see very often. That was a result of just a number of factors coming together at the same time, all of the supply chain disruptions, et cetera. So I'm not sure that's how you should be thinking about things.As we think about where lumber prices are going to go in the fall, it's really a function of, a, what's going to happen on the supply side. And I think we're going to continue to see puts and takes there with the additions in the South, the capacity coming out of British, Columbia, that dynamic, I think, is going to continue to play out. And then it's just really a function of what happens with homebuilding and repair and remodel. Our view is the homebuilders have done a remarkable job of managing and navigating an environment with higher mortgage rates. They seem to be pretty optimistic in the conversations that we're having with them. So my expectation is the back half of the year even with high 6% mortgage rates or even 7% mortgage rates is that we're still going to see strong single-family building, which will be supportive. And then it's the question of R&amp;R. And we've seen pretty strong demand out of that segment just as a data point. Year-over-year, our second quarter into the home improvement warehouse market was actually up. So we continue to expect that to be a strong market. And as the treaters come back in, in the fall, I would expect that we're going to see reasonably strong lumber prices. And then again, it will just depend on are there upside surprises on building? Or are there supply shocks that can cause that price ceiling to go up?OperatorOur next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners.Mark Adam WeintraubThanks for all the details on lumber and walking us through your thought process and how pricing might evolve. If we think about OSB, I guess the first question I have is you give on that slide that I think the current prices were like $70 higher as of July 1, the way you look at it. But I think you also referenced that you've got -- your order files are, what, 3 or 4 weeks, I believe. And so if we were to kind of assess real-time pricing in OSB, what does that mean? Can you give us a sense as to what you'd expect your prices to be given what you already know 3 to 4 weeks out once the real-time prices are what you would be calling your current prices?Devin W. StockfishYes. I mean without specifically giving the number, what I can tell you is directionally, our order files are actually 5 to 6 weeks out. So they're fairly extended. As you noted, Mark, what that means for us is that there is a lag to the current pricing. And so while what you see quarter-to-date in the earnings package is lower than current, that will catch up over time.So there will be a several week lag on the upside and the flip side of that is there's also a several week lag on the downside. So we ultimately get it. It's just a timing question. And for us, as we think about the quarter, there's a fair amount of leverage there. It's $8 million of EBITDA per quarter for every $10 increase. So there's a fairly significant upside. And I think just given the length of the order files, that's going to translate into a pretty strong quarter for OSB for us.Mark Adam WeintraubOkay. And recognizing that prices can move from where they are. But I mean, so if I -- can I look back 5 weeks or so and look at the increase that we've had and expect that to -- because that's over $100 plus, to expect that to translate into your prices? And then they'll go wherever prices real time go as we go forward. Is that a reasonable way to look at it?Devin W. StockfishYes, that's generally right.Mark Adam WeintraubOkay. And then you kind of had -- you'd mentioned that you felt in lumber that maybe we can see some improvement in the fall, et cetera. But it sounded like you're reasonably cautious over the summer. Correct me if I interpreted that incorrectly. How do you feel on OSB? Did you see the dynamics differently? And if so, why?Devin W. StockfishYes, I do different just because there's not a lot of OSB available. And I think what you're seeing right now with the pricing dynamic is most buyers went into the summer with very little inventory. And as you've seen that building activity pick up, the demand ended up being higher than people expected. And when they're going out and trying to buy open market OSP, there's just none there. And so that's going to take a little while to figure itself out. OSB is not as reliant on the R&amp;R market. So it's a little bit more focused on the single-family construction, which has continued to be pretty strong. So absent, a material pullback on the housing side, it would seem to me that we're going to see pretty tight market there for OSB, which should mean you should have strong OSB pricing into the fall.Mark Adam WeintraubOkay. Super. And just one last one. I know there are lots of concerns on fire season weeks or a couple of months ago and not hearing as much about it and certainly not in your comments, recognizing there's uncertainty. Have things calmed down? Or are things feeling like it's not going to be as dangerous a situation this year? Just a quick update.Devin W. StockfishYes. So in the Northwest, it's been a relatively mild wildfire season to date. I always caution people though. It really starts to become an issue typically in August and the early part of September. So we're not necessarily in the heat of the wildfire season yet in the Northwest. Obviously, in Canada, it's been a really bad year so far. There has been some rain in Alberta. So while we still have fire activity going on, I think that's calmed a little bit. In Northern BC, I think the fire activity has started to pick up a little bit. So as you think about some of the key regions for us, Washington, Oregon, British Columbia, I think that story will play out over the course of August. But to your point, at this juncture, in the Northwest, fire season hasn't been that bad.OperatorOur next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.Anthony James PettinariJust following up on the Mississippi deal, I think it transacted at kind of somewhat of a premium to some comps that we've seen in the state. I think you talked about it being well stocked and maybe having some synergies with existing operations. I'm just wondering if you could maybe touch on, I guess, the real estate and ENR opportunities that I think you were mentioned in the press release and maybe more broadly, I think you're the largest landowner in Mississippi. Can you just talk about that sort of Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas market in terms of anything that you're particularly excited about or concerned about maybe in the next few years?Devin W. StockfishYes, sure. So it's a really nice acquisition for us. A couple of things I would highlight, as you noted, really good, mature age class, high percentage of sawlog mix. And importantly, there's 2 pieces of it. There's a northern piece and a southern piece. Each of them are really close to short haul distances to lumber mills that we have in Mississippi. So some really nice synergies there. I think from a comp standpoint, just for frame of reference, one of our large competitors did a deal in Mississippi recently at $2,700 an acre. So it's pretty in line with what we've seen for the higher quality acquisitions in that Mississippi region.We are the largest landowner in Mississippi by a fair margin. I think the positive news from a Mississippi standpoint is we're seeing a fair bit of new capacity coming in there from a sawmill standpoint. We've got the pellet mills that are coming in and building new mills in Mississippi. So it's a market while it's been less tension perhaps than some of the other markets. And this is true for Louisiana and Arkansas, by the way. I do think that's where a lot of the new capacity is coming in. And with the work that Russell and his team are doing, we're working real hard to make sure that we can influence where some of that capacity is coming in so that it's placed in a region where we benefit from a timberland standpoint and can drive synergies for those customers. So I think we feel pretty good about the trajectory of all 3 of those markets. And my instinct here is that over the next several years, you're going to see some of the biggest price growth in those markets as that new capacity comes into place.Anthony James PettinariOkay. That's very helpful. And then just switching to Climate Solutions. I think you mentioned 2 carbon projects underway in the South. Given the experience you've gained with the main pilot, I mean, is it possible to say how long it might take for those 2 Southern projects to maybe ultimately start issuing credits? Is that 1 or 2 years or maybe longer or shorter? And then I kind of thought that the main project was chosen because economics in the northern region are maybe less compelling than in the Southern region. I don't know if that's the case or if that's changed. But is there any sort of change in view where carbon projects are getting more feasible or more attractive and you're moving them to the South or maybe these are special regions within the South. I don't know if you can comment there.Devin W. StockfishSure. Well, I think, first of all, with the main project, and that's why we call it a pilot project, is there were learnings that we acquired through that process. And I think we've been able to take the learnings from that main project and apply that to those 2 projects in the South. So my expectation is those projects are going to move dramatically faster than the main project. And we could have those issued as soon as later this year or early next year. So much faster. And again, I think we've taken a lot of the learnings from that initial project, which was the whole point in building out that group and the expertise so that we can start to scale this business.In terms of the regional decision-making for where carbon projects go, you're absolutely right. We started in May because the economics there are more supportive. But as you think about our portfolio of 7 million acres across the South, there are going to be certain parcels and certain tracks that are less economically beneficial than others. And so there are going to be places where the economics for carbon, even in the near term still makes sense in the South. And just to be clear, we're only going to do carbon projects where we think the economics in doing carbon will beat the economics of doing timber. And so part of that is the quality of the land base, but part of that is where we think carbon prices are trending. And what we've seen here of late is for improved forest management, carbon projects that are of high quality, they're generating strong pricing, and that's our expectation when we bring these credits to market.OperatorOur next question comes from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.Paul C. QuinnJust wanted to follow up on this Natural Climate Solutions and the carbon optionality that you've got. If you could -- and I appreciate the extra color on the 30,000 credits that you expect in year 1. What's the size of the main project that the scope of it that you put forward? And then what's the size of the 2 projects that you've got in the U.S. South?Devin W. StockfishYes. So we're not providing the specific acreage really for a couple of reasons, Paul. First is -- as we think about how we're managing these carbon projects, we're not just taking those acres out of production. We're going to continue to generate timber revenues from those acres in addition to carbon. So it's a little -- we feel like it's a little hard to put that in context just by throwing acres out there. So we're not going to be providing acreages for these products. We'll ultimately provide the number of credits and the revenues that we're generating from the credits. And that's how we'll dimension that going forward.Paul C. QuinnOkay. Well, just trying to scale it from my side then. The 30,000 credits, is that equating to somewhere in the $500,000 to $600,000 range?Devin W. StockfishWell, it depends on what you think pricing is going to be, $30,000. Yes, mid-20s is kind of a good way to think about it in terms of what we've seen lately and I think the quality of the credits we're bringing to market are really going to be at the top of the range. So that's how we're thinking about it.Paul C. QuinnOkay. And then just lastly, just -- is this 100% addition to your cash flow? Or is there an impact when you put these projects -- the carbon projects forward, i.e., is there an impact on harvest in the area?Devin W. StockfishYes, there will be some. Now obviously, we're picking areas which have economics where that's supported by the carbon. But ultimately, if you're going to get carbon credits, you are giving up some degree of volume. And so we're going to pick regions where that margin is the lowest and where that offset makes the most sense. But yes, there will be some offsetting impact to timber revenues where we do carbon projects.OperatorOur next question comes from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.Ketan MamtoraFirst question, Devin, you talked about the order files in OSP, which are quite extended right now. Can you give us some sense of what the order files are like in engineered wood and in lumber and how they compare for this time of the year versus historical average?Devin W. StockfishYes. Lumber order files are pretty normal. I mean, that's in a couple of week time frame, 1 to 2 weeks, which is pretty typical, particularly for this time of year. The EWP order files are extended depending on the product, out even beyond OSB. So they're back to a place where they're fairly lengthy order files.Ketan MamtoraUnderstood. Got you. And then coming back to wildfires. I mean, are your mills in Alberta back up to -- I thought I heard you say that you all took some downtime at 2 of your 3 mills. Are they back up running kind of fully? Or are there some -- still some restrictions whether related to the log decks or anything else there?Devin W. StockfishNo, those mills are both back up running full, no ongoing issues there. The downtime was really just when the fire got close to the community, there were evacuation orders. So everybody had to leave town. But as soon as those evacuation orders were lifted, we were back at the mills, and they're both back up running full.OperatorOur next question is from Mike Roxland with Truist Securities.Michael Andrew RoxlandVery good quarter. Just on EWP, can you talk about any regional differences that you've seen on EWP demand? I recall the West being more impacted some months ago from sort of market conditions and inclement weather, so have you seen a ramp on the West more than the South. But just help us figure out how that demand improvement has been broken up by region?Devin W. StockfishYes. I mean, California, in particular, earlier in the year and late last year was struggling, and that was, if you recall, just a result of wave after wave of storms hitting that market. So you really saw building activity slow quite a bit. As we got deeper into spring and early summer, the California market picked up quite a bit. And you can see that mostly in the Douglas fir lumber sales that we've got going into that California market that really saw an uptick as that building activity increased. I'd say there are always regional differences. California, I think, has been picking up. Texas is always a strong market. The South has generally been pretty strong. And I think all of those trends are holding. When you think about what's going on with EWP, there's obviously 2 pieces of that, though.There's the demand and how much building is going on and then there's also the supply that's going into each individual region. And our experience is every local market has its own competitive dynamic. And so it's always balancing, making sure that you're serving your customers, trying to make sure your margins feel good, but also making sure that you're holding market share against competitors who all want the same business. So that dynamic plays out in every region, every day. But I'd say on balance, again, the EWP market certainly has stabilized. And as you can see with our order files extending out, we feel pretty good about that trajectory. I mean, there will always be some ups and downs on pricing. But directionally, we feel pretty good about where EWP is going.Michael Andrew RoxlandJust following up, I mean, it's kind of interesting when you look at your special improvement in lumber versus EWP. Lumber about 5% sequentially in terms of volumes, but EWP up about 63% quarter-over-quarter. Can you help us frame like what's really driving the difference? I mean, is it all due to just the fact EWP is more single family related, maybe lumber has got the R&amp;R component? Or is there anything else driving the difference between lumber demand and EWP demand?Devin W. StockfishYes. I mean when you look at our sales volumes, it's really more of a function that we had scaled down our EWP production early in the year because of what was going on and just the dynamic with so many buyers destocking. So the big volume increase in EWP, I mean, obviously, it's related to the fact that there's been a pickup in homebuilding activity, but the delta between the improvements in volume in EWP and the improvements in volume in lumber is just that EWP was operating at 60% capacity for the first quarter, whereas lumber wasn't down nearly as much. But that was an intentional decision on our part just to match supply with demand.Michael Andrew RoxlandGot you. And one final question before turning it over. Just the operating rate in EWP in 2Q?Devin W. StockfishYes, it was in the mid-70s, mid -- or low to mid-70s. And so we think it will be up just a little bit in Q3.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Devin Stockfish for closing comments.Devin W. StockfishAll right. Terrific. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day.OperatorThis concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you for your participation.]"

On a year-over-year basis, the top and bottom lines declined.WY’s shares were down 1.9% in the after-hours trading session on Jul 27, after the earnings release.Meanwhile, in July, Weyerhaeuser made a significant acquisition, purchasing 22,000 acres of timberlands in Mississippi for around $60 million. These timberlands are known for their high productivity and have been strategically chosen due to their proximity to Weyerhaeuser's current operations. The acquisition is expected to bring about immediate synergies and create additional opportunities for real estate and natural climate solutions.Inside the HeadlinesThe company reported adjusted earnings of 32 cents per share, beating the consensus mark of 21 cents by 52.4% but decreasing 69.8% from the year-ago reported figure of $1.06 cents.Net sales for the quarter were $1,997 million, missing the consensus mark of $2,028 million by 1.5% and declining 32.8% from the $2,973 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Net sales, however, grew 6.2% sequentially.Adjusted EBITDA came in at $469 million, significantly down from $1,205 million in the year-ago period but an improvement from $395 million in the first quarter of 2023.Weyerhaeuser Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseWeyerhaeuser Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseWeyerhaeuser Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Weyerhaeuser Company QuoteSegment DetailsTimberlands: Net sales (including inter-segment sales of $150 million) from the segment was $567 million, down from the year-ago figure of $671 million. Meanwhile, we expected segment sales to decline 9.6% year over year to $606.4 million in the quarter.Adjusted EBITDA came in at $172 million, down from $219 million in the year-ago quarter.Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources: For the reported quarter, the segment’s net sales amounted to $80 million, down from $117 million a year ago. Our model predicted segment sales to decline 9.7% year over year to $105.6 million.Adjusted EBITDA came in at $70 million, reflecting a decline from $107 million reported in the year-ago level.Wood Products: For the second quarter, segment sales totaled $1,500 million, down from $2,341 million in the prior-year period. We expected segment sales to decline 37.6% year over year to $1,461.2 million in the quarter.Adjusted EBITDA came in at $270 million, significantly down from $912 million a year ago.Story continuesFinancial HighlightsAs of Jun 30, 2023, Weyerhaeuser had cash and cash equivalents of $1,095 million, down from $1,581 million at 2022-end but up from $797 million at March 2023-end. Long-term debt was $4,817 million at the quarter-end, up from $4,071 million at 2022-end and from $4,072 million at March 2023-end.Net cash from operations was $496 million for the second quarter, down from $1,146 million a year ago but up from $126 million in the prior quarter.Q3 OutlookFor the Timberland segment, the company expects earnings (before special items) and adjusted EBITDA to be $25 million low sequentially. In the West, it anticipates moderately lower sales realizations and fee harvest volumes, partially offset by improved per-unit log and haul costs. For the Southern region, the company expects slightly lower sales realizations, with fee harvest volumes and per unit log and haul costs expected to remain on par from the second quarter.In the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment, Weyerhaeuser expects earnings to be sequentially higher. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be approximately $20 million higher than the second quarter, thanks to the timing and mix of sales. The company still expects 2023 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million and expects basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 35% to 40% for the year.Within the Wood Products segment, Weyerhaeuser projects a substantial increase in third-quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA compared to the second quarter, primarily driven by improved average sales prices for lumber and oriented strand board or OSB. However, when excluding the impact of these factors, the company foresees that its third-quarter financial results will be slightly lower than those of the second quarter.Regarding lumber, the company expects a moderate rise in sales volumes, along with a decline in log costs and slightly reduced unit manufacturing costs. As for OSB, Weyerhaeuser anticipates comparable sales volumes and fiber costs but slightly higher unit manufacturing costs. Turning to engineered wood products, the company foresees a slight increase in sales volumes. However, it expects slightly lower sales realizations and faces higher raw material costs, primarily attributable to oriented strand board webstock.Zacks RankCurrently, WY sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.Dennis E. McDanielHello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued the news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors.The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you'll first hear from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions.At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including President Steve Spray; Chief Investment Officer, Steve Soloria and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hopper.First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP.Now I'll turn over the call to Steve.Story continuesSteven Justus JohnstonGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. Net income of $534 million for the second quarter of 2023 was quite a change from the net loss of more than $800 million for last year's second quarter.As we've noted in the past, large income swings can occur as gains and losses from securities still held in our equity portfolio run through net income. Last year, we saw a reduction in portfolio fair value. And this year, we recognized a significant investment gain. We believe the value of our equity portfolio will continue to grow over the long term.As of June 30, it had $6.1 billion in appreciated value, increasing 8% since the end of the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating income of $191 million for the quarter more than doubled the $94 million from a year ago, despite catastrophe losses that were $11 million higher on an after-tax basis.Our 97.6% second quarter 2023 property casualty combined ratio was 5.6 percentage points better than last year's second quarter, including a decrease of 0.4 points for catastrophe losses. The 90.4% ex-cat accident year combined ratio for the second quarter was 2.4 percentage points better than the same period a year ago and is another important indicator of improved performance.Despite the increase in catastrophe losses and ongoing elevated inflation effects, we continue to see reasons for confidence about performance for the second half of the year. Pricing continued to accelerate during the second quarter of this year, and we also worked to address inflation in other ways, such as changing factors that adjust premiums to account for rising property costs.We reported improved underwriting performance ratios in just about every major line of business compared with the first quarter of this year. On a current accident year basis, measured at June 30 before catastrophe losses, our 2023 and consolidated property casualty loss and loss expense ratio improved from 2022 by 4.5 percentage points on a case incurred basis, which included 0.6 point improvement on a paid basis.For the same period, we increased the incurred but not reported or IBNR component of the ratio by 4.7 points as we continue to recognize uncertainty regarding ultimate losses remaining prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear.Similar to the first quarter, we earned a small underwriting profit for our commercial umbrella line in the second quarter. In our commercial casualty line of business in total had an estimated combined ratio of approximately 90%. Our underwriters continue to do an excellent job in risk selection and pricing Importantly, Asians appointed by Cincinnati Insurance continue to produce profitable business for us in an outstanding fashion.Underwriters emphasize retention of profitable accounts addressing ones that we determine have inadequate pricing while also seeking profitable new business. Estimated average renewal price increases for the second quarter were higher than the first quarter for each of our major lines of business. Our Commercial Lines Insurance segment averaged near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, while our excess and surplus lines insurance segment moved higher in the high single-digit range.Personal Lines for the second quarter included auto in the high single-digit range and homeowner in the mid-single-digit range. In terms of net written premiums, consolidated property casualty growth was 9% for the second quarter of 2023. That included an 11% increase in second quarter renewal written premiums with a significant portion from higher levels of insurance exposures as we factor in elevated inflation.Next, I'll briefly highlight premium growth and profitability by Insurance segment. Commercial Lines grew second quarter 2023 net written premiums 3%, reflecting discipline, particularly for commercial umbrella risks. Its combined ratio was 9.4 percentage points better than a year ago, including 1.5 points from lower catastrophe losses. We see the second quarter 10% reduction in new business written premiums as an expected result of pricing and underwriting discipline.Personal Lines grew net written premiums 23%, with growth in middle market accounts in addition to Cincinnati Private Client business for the high net worth clients and our agencies. Its combined ratio was 4.5 percentage points better than a year ago despite an increase of 0.6 points from catastrophe losses.Excess and surplus lines had a combined ratio of 92.2% and net written premiums grew 16%. Its combined ratio was 7.1 percentage points higher than a year ago, including a 9.9 point increase in the IBNR component. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global continued to enhance our profitability. Cincinnati Re had a strong 73.7% combined ratio for the second quarter of 2023. Its net written premiums essentially matched last year's second quarter while casualty premiums decreased as a result of fewer attractive opportunities in certain segments of the market, property net written premiums increased by 27%, largely due to a combination of higher pricing and market opportunities.Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was 88.3% with net written premiums continuing strong growth at 19%. Our life insurance subsidiary continued to report excellent results in the second quarter with net income up 91% from last year in term life insurance earned premium growth of 4%.As I usually do, I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Our second quarter 2023 VCR was 4.0%, another strong result. Net income before investment gains or losses contributed 1.8%, while favorable valuation of our investment portfolio added another 2.2%.Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight other important factors about our financial performance.Michael James SewellThank you, Steve, and thanks for all of you for joining us today. Investment income continued at a strong pace of 13% for the second quarter of 2023 versus last year's second quarter. As expected, dividend income decreased 3% for the quarter due to 2 items we touched on last quarter.First, we are seeing dividend rates increase more slowly. Second, in last year's second quarter, we received a $5 million special dividend from one of our stockholdings that didn't repeat this year. Net equity security purchases for the first half of 2023 totaled $93 million. Bond interest income rose 19% in the second quarter compared with the second quarter of 2022.We added more fixed-maturity securities to our investment portfolio with the net purchases totaling $732 million for the first 6 months of the year. The second quarter pretax average yield of 4.34% for the fixed-maturity portfolio was 34 basis points higher than a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the second quarter of 2023 was 5.88%. Valuation changes in aggregate for our equity portfolio during the second quarter of 2023 were favorable, but were unfavorable for the bond portfolio.Before tax effects, the net gain for the equity portfolio was $459 million, while the net loss for the bond portfolio was [$158 million]. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $5.3 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $6.1 billion, while the fixed-maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $838 million.Strong cash flow again contributed to investment income growth in addition to rising bond yields boosting interest income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 6 months of 2023 was $825 million, up 9% from a year ago. We continue to emphasize expense management with a balance between controlling expenses and making strategic investments in our business.The second quarter 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.2 percentage points lower than last year as premium growth outpaced growth in total expenses. Next, I'll comment on loss reserves. We continue to use a consistent approach that targets net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business.For the first half of 2023, our net increase in property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $452 million, including $358 million for the IBNR portion. During the second quarter, we experienced $101 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 5.5 percentage points.On an [all-lines] basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 6 months of 2023 included: favorable $99 million for 2022; unfavorable $5 million for 2021; favorable $49 million for 2020 and a favorable $17 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020.Regarding capital management, our approach remains consistent as we pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares that include maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. We still believe our financial flexibility is outstanding, and that our financial strength is in excellent shape. During the second quarter of 2023, we repurchased approximately 398,000 shares at an average price per share of $104.48. We also paid [$117 million] in dividends to shareholders during the quarter.As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of second quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.24. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.15. Investment income other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items added $0.86. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value by $0.81. And Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $2.31, and we declared $0.75 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $2 per share during the second quarter to $7.33 per share.Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.Steven Justus JohnstonThanks, Mike. We are in the challenging insurance market, and I'm proud of the way our associates are navigating it. We believe we are taking the necessary actions to continue delivering profitable growth through all insurance cycles. In the last month, 2 third-party organizations agreed. S&amp;P affirmed our high financial strength ratings, and we were also again included on the Ward's 50 list, recognizing our growth, profitability and shareholder return.We are 1 of only 4 companies named 32 times to the Property Casualty Ward's 50 since the analysis began in 1991. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Solaria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. Vaishnavi, please open the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.Jon Paul NewsomeCongrats on the quarter. I wanted to ask maybe a little detail on the source of the competition that's been hampering the new business production in commercial [happy if you'd name -- names], but if you give us a sense of just kind of what kind of companies sort of products, et cetera, that keeping you more disciplined.Stephen Michael SprayPaul, Steve Spray. I would reiterate kind of what Steve said there in his closing prepared remarks, just that it's a challenging market. This business, as I've said in the past, it's local. You get various competitors in different states that just have a different view of risk.I think from my perspective, it's been more about our underwriters and our field reps just continuing to execute working with our agents on disciplined pricing and underwriting. It's profit first here, or segmenting the business. But from time to time, you'll see carriers that maybe have a different view of the risk. And we've just got the tools today that we didn't have in the past to be able to be disciplined about it. And just couldn't be more proud of the team, both on the new business front, our field reps and our renewal underwriters and the way they're executing.And I would add that it's a dynamic market, we're seeing it change on a daily basis. And at the end of the second quarter, we did see, I would say, the market coming more to us on the pricing side and some new business. It's one month of an end of a quarter, so it may not make a trend, but we did see some improvement in new business towards the tail end of the second quarter. Hopefully, that answers your question, Paul.Jon Paul NewsomeIt's definitely getting there. Just maybe a little bit mistaking, but I was kind of going through the supplement, and I noticed that recent commercial business, there's a little bit less of a loss IBNR booked up in the quarter. Anything anomalous there that you want to call out on that number?Steven Justus JohnstonPaul, this is Steve. And actually, on a dollar basis, our IBNR [didn't] increase. It's just our premium increased a little bit faster. And I think last year, second quarter of last year, I think we've -- I think we've seen the situation with inflation and recognize the leveraged effect of inflation on higher limits and umbrella in particular, and we're strong to address that last year. So I think, again, we still had more dollars added to IBNR this quarter, just slightly less on -- as a ratio of earned premium.OperatorThe next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James.Charles Gregory PetersI guess, I'm going to focus on first question would be in the commercial casualty component of your financial supplement. And if you look at the total loss and loss expense ratio really began to show some nice improvement in the second quarter. And obviously, it's a longer tail line of business. And I'm just curious -- it seems like now with the loss ratio having improved, this would be a time to perhaps start writing more of that business, and yet we see it moving in the opposite direction. So maybe you could -- and I know you've provided some previous comments on it, maybe you could just give us some added context.Steven Justus JohnstonYes. Good question, Greg. And I think the 2 are kind of related. I think the improvement is a result of the discipline that we're showing in pricing and underwriting and particularly in our umbrella line of business. The other side of that is, as Steve mentioned, is we are more disciplined in the market -- it makes us a little bit harder to compete on a price basis with some others that don't have that same view of risk. So I think the two go together and would really just -- I can't add much to Steve's earlier response in terms of how we're handling that competitive market.Charles Gregory PetersRight. I wanted to pivot just on property, whether it's inside the commercial or in the personal line space because I feel like the rate is a combination of factors, including insured to value numbers being reset. And so I'm -- when I look, for example, in your personal lines, your net written premium in homeowners up 27% in the second quarter. I'm wondering how much of that is pure rate versus actual just getting the insured to value numbers right? Or -- maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way? I don't know. It seems like a valid question though.Stephen Michael SprayYes, Greg, Steve Spray. On -- specifically on commercial property and personal property and homeowner, it's about 2/3 exposure, about 1/3 rate would be a good way to look at it.Charles Gregory PetersOkay. That's helpful. I guess the final question I have, recognizing that others are going to want to ask questions would just be before you'd previously mapped out sort of an expectation for the combined ratio for the year. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that range in the context of the second quarter results as we think about the second half of the year? That's my last question.Steven Justus JohnstonGreg, this is Steve Johnston. And I think we're still where we were at the -- when we first came out with it at the first quarter, we don't think it's -- we think it's reasonable that we would be able to be in the low to mid-90s combined ratio, 8% growth. But we have those caveats of that the weather and the market conditions are volatile and that will play out over the second half.I think the key point is we are just very confident in the movement of the ex-cat core portion of the book. It's improving nicely and that's really our focus at this point. But again, I think we're still where we were with the information that we gave in the first quarter.OperatorNext question comes from Mike Zaremski with BMO.Michael David ZaremskiCurious, any insights into pricing power into July? And also just curious, have you guys been a bit surprised at some of the pricing power that you've experienced. -- given the strong interest rate tailwinds that are a good guy? Or does it make sense that we're seeing kind of broader industry pricing inflect -- accelerate a bit?Steven Justus JohnstonThis is Steve Johnston. And it is -- it's just -- it's an execution of our business model that makes us feel good and that we are -- have great relationships with our agents. We tend to communicate and try to communicate where we are risk by risk early in the process of a renewal and just feel the execution that makes us so proud of our field people as they're out in the field, balancing discipline with being responsive to our agents' needs has boded well for us and we see it continuing to do so as we go into the second half.Michael David ZaremskiOkay. You mentioned that the -- I think in the prepared remarks, the umbrella components, of your portfolio kind of eked out a small underwriting profit. Just curious as umbrella, given kind of what you've known -- you've experienced over the last year or 2 or maybe more -- maybe it's more also just prone to social inflation. Is umbrella, are you -- are you kind of targeting a better combined ratio for that versus the broader segment it's in?Stephen Michael SprayYes. Over -- I think over the last '22 -- the end of '22 and prior, Mike, again, this is Steve Spray. Our combined ratio in umbrella was running around [80%]. The last, like you said the last couple of years, have been challenging. It's jurisdictional. It could be state by state, it's risk by risk. And that loss ratio, like Steve said in the prepared remarks, we've been profitable here for the first half and obviously in the second quarter.We've been very deliberate about improving that line of business. And I would say, yes, we expect that loss ratio to improve from where it is today. I'll give you maybe a little bit more color on that, too. In the second quarter, our commercial umbrella net written premium was down 9 points, which contributed a 2-point drag on the overall Commercial Lines net written premium. So it's been deliberate like Steve said, we got early and often with our agents to make sure that there's no surprises and work with them on pricing terms, conditions, reducing limits in some specific jurisdictions or specific risks that we think we -- that have been challenging for us.Michael David ZaremskiOkay. That's helpful. And then, maybe lastly, switching gears to Personal Lines. I think on last quarter's call, you talked about -- or maybe it wasn't a call, but I think you guys have talked about you being one of the -- now the biggest writers in terms of new business in, for example, the state of California as others have been retrenching.Maybe you can kind of give us an update on what you're seeing in terms of kind of industry dynamics, competitive wise and personal lines and why you feel good about growing into some of these states where some competitors have had trouble kind of getting the pricing they need to keep up with loss inflation and very -- comes from the standpoint of understanding you have a very profitable personal lines book.Stephen Michael SprayYes. Thanks, Mike. Steve Spray again. yes, we feel really good and are bullish about personal lines, both on the high net worth and then the middle market business. The high net worth now or what we -- Cincinnati Private Client has become about 55% of our business.I would start with the fact that the team we have, the amount of expertise that we have selectively had joined from the outside and then the long-term associates we've had in building out that expertise not only on product but on marketing, on claims. I think we have been very well received across the country by our agents. And specifically growing in states that you mentioned where there's been quite a bit of industry disruption.And we have definitely seen quite a bit of disruption, especially for the high net worth business. And as an example, one way we were able to deal with that is we were able to pivot in California as a specific example, and move to writing homeowners business on an excess and surplus lines basis. And I think it goes true to Cincinnati over time as we've been able to be there for our agents and be there for the policy holders in their community, provide, with a measured capacity.We are in this high net worth business for the long term. We look at everything we do over the long term. And feel like we're positioned really well to continue to grow that business and grow it profitably. We have some work to do. Inflation has impacted the entire book, but we're confident in the underwriting and especially the pricing actions we've taken to improve those results.OperatorThe next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW.Meyer ShieldsA couple of quick questions, I guess. Steve, you talked about pricing accelerating pretty much every line of business sequentially. Was there any change in your internal view of trend from first quarter to second quarter?Steven Justus JohnstonYes. Meyer, this is Steve. I don't really think so. I think we are seeing -- it's very granular. We look at it by line, by state and so forth. And so you'll see some movement in directions at a very detailed level. But -- for the most part, I think we're seeing a similar view of trends first quarter to second quarter.Meyer ShieldsOkay. Perfect. I'm not 100% sure this is a good question. But when I look at the loss ratio detail, vastly higher provision for IBNR is in Personal Lines than Commercial Lines. And I was wondering, is that a function of just bad weather? Or is there something else driving that?Steven Justus JohnstonI think probably, Meyer, it's the growth as much as anything. There's faster growth in the Personal Line space right now.Meyer ShieldsOkay. Perfect. That makes sense. And then one last question, if I can, is a little more detailed. But have you disclosed which lines of business saw the reserve release from (inaudible) .Steven Justus JohnstonThat has not been part of our disclosure, Meyer.OperatorThe next question comes from Grace Carter with Bank of America.Grace Helen CarterHi, everyone. Looking at the commercial property underlying loss ratio, that experienced quite a bit of improvement, both sequentially and year-over-year. Obviously, that line can be really volatile, but I was just curious the extent to which that was maybe impacted by the classification of cat versus non-cat in the quarter and pricing flowing through and just the extent to which we should extrapolate that going forward?Stephen Michael SprayI can -- Grace, Steve Spray. I can take a shot at that. We have individual state plans, both for all lines -- for all lines and segments. But in Commercial Lines specifically, and we -- the first thing we look at, I think, at every state is just the CAT profile. We do believe you can underwrite and price for CAT, you have to.And I would think terms, conditions percentage deductibles for CAT. We've got the tools to understand what the -- what our average annual loss looks like. We price to that. So I think you're seeing improvement just because of the discipline that we've put both in the CAT and the non-cat. I don't know if anybody else wants to add anything as far as numbers.Steven Justus JohnstonI think, you handled it quite well, Steve.Grace Helen CarterOkay, and I guess, looking at the workers' comp underlying loss ratio. That ticked up a bit versus what we're used to seeing. I was curious if there is anything kind of one-off there or if you've seen a change in loss trend or if that's just the accumulated impact of lower pricing in that line over time.Steven Justus JohnstonGrace, this is Steve Johnston. I do think that just accumulation of the lower pricing over time, it just does have a compounding effect. We've been very disciplined. As you can see, there have been a decrease in our writings there as we've maintained discipline over a period of time so that we feel particularly as an account underwriter that we're in a good spot overall.Grace Helen CarterAnd then I guess, finally, just talking about commercial casualty pretty broadly umbrella and -- I mean the underlying loss ratio there did see some improvement as well as a pretty favorable impact from reserve releases. I'm just trying to square that versus some of the commentary that we've heard over the past few quarters over being pretty cautious in that part of the business.Did you get any new information in the quarter regarding loss cost trends that gives you some more confidence regarding where that line is going? Or is this just kind of the impact of the actions that you've taken in that book over the past several quarters?Steven Justus JohnstonI think your last point is what it is. It's been the action over the last several quarters and trying to get out early and start to address the inflation and the leveraged effect of inflation.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Fred Nelson, Private Investor.Unidentified AnalystYes. Two things that are really all of you that are on the call have worked with the company needs to know that the philosophy of Cincinnati Financial of rising dividends and integrity and honesty. I cannot tell you the number of people that have told me that it's allowed them to do things in their lives, with their kids, their grandkids, that they never dreamed possible. And I think I want to say thank you to all of you for that philosophy because it's really, really important in our country.The thing that I'd like to know is the number of shares outstanding at the end of the period? It says you divide the shareholders' equity for the number of shares out there to get the book value, and I would appreciate if you could tell me how many shares are outstanding at the end of the period to get the book value.Steven Justus JohnstonWell, thank you, Fred. This is Steve Johnston. And first off, I really want to thank you for your comments. It just really makes my day. It makes all of our days. You're talking to everybody here at the company. And we really appreciate your comments. I believe the number of shares outstanding is 158.6 million.Unidentified AnalystAt the end of the period?Steven Justus JohnstonAt the end of the period.Unidentified AnalystYou divide -- how many shares?Steven Justus JohnstonI think it's 158.6 million.Unidentified AnalystAnd if you divide that into the shareholder equity value of $11,030 million, do you get $70.33?Steven Justus JohnstonI believe that's right.Michael James SewellThat's right, Fred.Steven Justus JohnstonI may have transposed it. I think it's 156.8 million not 150 -- I was going from my -- I was going from memory and somebody slipped a piece of paper to me here. So I apologize for the transposing the shares.Unidentified AnalystI appreciate what you just said because that's the figure I got with my old math.Steven Justus JohnstonOkay. Good. The old math is always the best, Fred.Unidentified AnalystOne of my people that live within Cincinnati has said her motto was TYG, thank you, God.Steven Justus JohnstonHere you go. Here you go. Thank you so much.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Johnston for any closing remarks.Steven Justus JohnstonThank you, Vaishnavi, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter call.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may all now disconnect.]"

The company’s profitability continues to be negatively impacted by higher programming and production costs across Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. Disney’s leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.Nevertheless, Disney is benefiting from growing popularity of Disney+ core, owing to a strong content portfolio and a cheaper bundle offering.

The company holds a strong solvency position in the near term.However, Boeing expects supply-chain disruptions to continue to harm its operational results, at least in the near term. Further, the company has been incurring notable abnormal production cost in relation to production quality issues for 787 jets, which may hurt its future results.(You can read the full research report on Boeing here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of General Electric have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the past year (+97.2% vs. +4.0%). Strong performance of the Aerospace unit, driven by commercial aerospace strength, significant growth in LEAP engine deliveries and higher defense engine orders, is aiding General Electric’s growth.With strength in GE Gas Power services and growth at Grid business and Onshore Wind in North America, signs of improvement in GE Vernova (the combined operations of GE Power and Renewable) hold promise. Due to these tailwinds, the company has raised its 2023 guidance.However, supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressure and foreign currency headwinds are other concerns for General Electric.(You can read the full research report on General Electric here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX), GSK plc (GSK) and América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Valero Energy's (NYSE:VLO) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Valero Energy is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.33 = US$15b ÷ (US$61b - US$15b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Valero Energy has an ROCE of 33%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Oil and Gas industry average of 22%. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Valero Energy compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEValero Energy has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 200% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Story continuesThe Bottom LineTo bring it all together, Valero Energy has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. And with a respectable 40% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Valero Energy can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Valero Energy and understanding this should be part of your investment process.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Now I'll turn the call over to Lane for opening remarks.Story continuesLane Riggs: Thank you, Homer, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss quarterly results, I want to thank Joe Gorder for everything he's done to build upon Valero's 43-year history. Joe steered a repositioning of our strategy and the commitment to shareholder returns through capital discipline, innovation and strong execution. I'm grateful for his leadership and proud of what Valero has accomplished, and I'm honored to build on that foundation as we continue to advance our position as a leading manufacturer of liquid transportation fuels. Moving on to quarterly results. We are pleased to report solid financial results in the second quarter, underpinned by our strong execution across all of our business segments. Our refineries ran well with throughput capacity utilization of 94% as refinery margins were supported by continued tight product supply and demand balances.Product demand was strong with our US wholesale system setting a sales record of over one million barrels per day in May and June. We also had a positive contribution from the Port Arthur Coker project, which was started up in early April and is operating well and at full capacity. The new coker has increased the refinery's throughput capacity and enhance its ability to process incremental volumes of heavy crude and residual feedstocks. Our Renewable Diesel segment set records for operating income and sales volumes in the second quarter, driven by incremental production volumes from Diamond Green Diesel, Port Arthur. The Diamond Green Diesel sustainable aviation fuel project at Port Arthur is progressing on schedule. Plan is expected to have the ability to upgrade 50% of the current 470 million gallon annual renewable diesel production capacity through Sustainable Aviation Fuel or SAF, is expected to be complete in 2025 and have estimated a cost of $315 million, with half of that attributable to Valero.With the completion of this project, DGD is expected to become one of the largest manufacturers of SAF in the world. These projects expand our long-term competitive advantage, and I want to commend our projects and operations team for their dedication and execution. We also continue to evaluate other opportunities while maintaining capital discipline and honoring our commitment that all projects meet a minimum return threshold. On the financial side, we returned 53% of the adjusted net cash provided by operating activities to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter. And we ended the second quarter with a net debt to capitalization ratio of 18%. Looking ahead, we expect low global light product inventories and tight product supply-and-demand balances to continue to support refining fundamentals.azerbaijan, baku, business, crane, dawn, derricks, drilling, energy, engineering, equipment, evening, exploration, fuel, gas, gasoline, industrial, industry, installation, land, machinery, offshore, oil, petrol, petroleum, platform, power, production, pumps, rig, sea, shallow, ship, silhouette, sky, technology, tool, tug, vessel, water, wellCopyright: Elnur / 123RF Stock PhotoGlobal demand for transportation fuels has recovered substantially with gasoline and diesel demand now comparable to pre-pandemic levels and jet fuel demand continues to increase steadily.

Renewable Diesel sales volumes averaged 4.4 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2023, which was 2.2 million gallons per day higher than the second quarter of 2022.

Moving to financing activities. We returned over $1.3 billion to our stockholders in the second quarter of 2023, of which $367 million was paid as dividends and $951 million was for the purchase of approximately 8.4 million shares of common stock resulting in a payout ratio of 53% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities.

Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.

If you want to skip our primer on the stock market and the economy, then head on over to What Are The Best Stocks To Buy Right Now? Top 5 Stocks. When it comes to the turmoil in the U.S. economy that kicked off with the coronavirus pandemic and was extended due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, July 2023 has been the climaxing month. The start of the month saw investors wait with bated breaths about a crucial jobs report that would have provided the first signal about the Federal Reserve's plans for future interest rate hikes. While the central bank had nearly penciled in a 25 basis point interest rate increase for July, the concern surrounded future decisions, especially for the next meeting in September. The month started off with rather shocking private payrolls report that nearly took the wind out of the rally in the first half of 2023, as the data showed that more than twice the number of jobs were added than analysts were actually expecting.This shock was followed by new jobs data from the Labor Department that actually undershot expectations and provided a breather to analysts and investors. Then, inflation for June also saw a cooling off and led to the annual figure sitting at 3% and ending up being below the Dow Jones consensus estimates of 3.1%. However, more drama was in store for investors as July's final week settled in. This was in the form of two additional data sets that enabled an understanding of how far the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have made it into the economy and whether there is any justification for the Fed to even consider raising rates in September or later.The first data set was the GDP growth report from the Commerce Department. This report, like several others before it, provided a conflicting set of conclusions. On a positive note, it showed that the American economy grew by 2.4% in the second quarter with the growth accelerating from 2% in the first quarter. It added that price indexes also grew at a slower pace, lending credence to the belief that no further hikes might be required since inflation is cooling. The second quarter GDP growth data was met by another data release again from the Commerce Department. This was the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index which is also the Fed's favorite inflation tool. Prior to the release, economists were expecting the core PCE to sit at 4.2% annually and 0.3% over the month, and the data met these estimates. The pure PCE, namely prices that also include food and energy, stood at 3% in June, for the slowest pace in two years, and provided a lot of respite to jittery currency markets in particular as all major currencies gained against the U.S. dollar.Story continuesWhile the pure PCE is the Fed's favorite inflation metric, the central bank also monitors the labor and jobs market through several reports. One of these is the Employment Cost Index from the Labor Department. It revealed that civilian compensation costs in America rose by just 1% in Q2 2023 - for the slowest pace of increase since the second quarter of 2021. Annually, in June 2023, wages grew by 4.6% in June, slowing down from 5% in the first quarter. Combined, this data set shows that wage pressures are slowing down, and opens up hope for this trend to continue in the future to bring down inflation and not tip the economy into a recession.So, what's going on in the stock market now that the clouds finally might be disappearing? Well, the market, as you might know, has been on a tear this year. The NASDAQ 100 index closed Friday after gaining 1.85%, while the NASDAQ Composite, the S&amp;P500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) were up 1.90%, 0.99%, and 0.50%, respectively. This brings the year to date gains of the NASDAQ 100 to an exact 45% - and at a time when many had predicted that American economic output might be on the decline. As to whether this market optimism is warranted, Brent Schutte, the chief investment officer of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management believes that those that have made money on the market are done by now and the recent euphoria comes from folks who missed out on the fireworks during H1 2023.He simply put his sentiment as:Those same people who are probably piling in right now were wrong about their outlook nine months ago and now they’re reversing course. I’m pushing in the opposite direction. The equity market will have some difficult months ahead.So, in a market where most people are confused about what's really going on for months, the true question is which stocks should one buy.

SLG need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Aug 18, 2023 $2.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for SL Green shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, SL Green is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry that ranks in the Bottom 32% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while four have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.32 per share to $1.30 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about SL Green right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

The Federal Reserve's most recent action of increasing the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points has propelled it to its highest level in 22 years. This decision, though aimed to check inflation, has stirred concerns among investors. As the benchmark interest rate climbs to a range of 5.25%-5.5%, investors may face challenges in balancing risk and return.Well, you can simply arrive at a decision to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns when the market is facing myriad issues. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision.Well, a company should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio called the interest coverage ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. LECO, McKesson Corporation MCK, Atmos Energy Corporation ATO and O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. ORLY are four stocks with an impressive interest coverage ratio.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company. The company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.The interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Story continuesWhat’s the Strategy?Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest coverage ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Lincoln Electric Holdings, a leader in the engineering, design, and manufacturing of advanced arc welding solutions, automated joining, assembly and cutting systems, plasma and oxy-fuel cutting equipment, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of B.

Dan?Story continuesDaniel Joseph HoustonThanks, Humphrey, and welcome to everyone on the call. This morning, I will share key aspects of our second quarter financial results and some notable performance highlights. Deanna will follow with additional details and an update on our current financial and capital position. Our leading position in the U.S. small to midsized business market contributed to healthy growth across our benefits and protection and retirement businesses. Across the enterprise, we continue to balance investing for growth in our business with disciplined expense management and favorable 2023 equity market performance is starting to benefit revenue in our fee-based businesses.Starting on Slide 3, we reported $376 million of non-GAAP operating earnings or $1.53 per diluted share in the second quarter, excluding significant variances, earnings per share increased 4% over the second quarter of 2022. Our second quarter results highlight our focus on our growth drivers, the power of our integrated offerings and the value of our differentiated distribution and joint venture partnerships and our deep customer relationships.During the quarter, we delivered on our capital deployment strategy, investing for growth in our business and returning $255 million of excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases and common stock dividends. Our business has generated strong free capital flow in the quarter and we are on track to deliver on our targeted 75% to 85% for the full year. We ended the quarter with nearly $675 billion of total company managed AUM, a 2% increase from the first quarter. Improved market performance and positive impacts from foreign currency more than offset a negative $3.9 billion of net cash flow. Across the industry, active asset managers were challenged by net outflows in the quarter.While our real estate net cash flow was positive in the quarter and year-to-date, it was pressured relative to prior periods. Looking ahead, we are beginning to see greater opportunities to deploy new money into real estate marketplace. We have a real estate pipeline of approximately $7 billion of committed yet unfunded mandates that are expected to be invested over the next 12 to 18 months as valuations and market conditions stabilize.The third quarter is off to a good start for global asset management, as we are seeing momentum build across high-yield and core fixed income, specialty equity strategies, local solutions in our international markets and select real estate property types such as data centers. We are well positioned to capture net cash flow across our platform as investor appetite for risk assets, returns and our yield-oriented capabilities become attractive again as we approach the end of the Fed rate hike cycle. As shown on Slide 4, investment performance improved significantly across our Morningstar rated funds and composites, including our fixed income, asset allocation and actively managed equity strategies. We're continuing to create new products and diversify across investment vehicles. We are bringing to market new ETFs that offer investors additional ways to access some of our most popular solutions. In mid-July, we launched the focused blue-chip ETF to offer investors another way to access our large cap strategy, which has generated strong long-term returns for our investors. We also launched a new equity strategy with our asset management joint venture, CCB Principal Asset Management. This strategy offers investors an offshore opportunity to invest in the new energy industry in China, including renewable power, electrical equipment, energy storage and electric vehicles. We are working through the final regulatory stages to make the UCITS fund available across much of Asia. With this positive momentum and recovery in our investment performance, we're optimistic for asset management net cash flow in the second half of the year.In Principal International, total AUM increased 4% and to $174 billion during the quarter, primarily driven by favorable market performance and foreign currency translation. I've had the opportunity to engage in person with many of our long-standing global joint venture partners in the first half of the year. We have established deep relationships combining our global expertise with their market-leading distribution capabilities. I have great confidence in the differentiated value of these relationships to continue to enable preferred access to global high-growth markets. Across U.S. retirement and benefits and protection, revenue is benefiting from strong employment market, especially within the small to mid-sized business segment, though we are seeing moderation in employment growth from record highs, wage growth has accelerated. These employment trends, coupled with strong sales retention are contributing to our continued above-market premium and fee growth in Specialty Benefits, which increased 8% over the second quarter of 2022. Capitalizing on opportunities, we launched a Hospital Indemnity insurance product in the second quarter. This product complements our existing core workplace benefits, rounds out the voluntary products portfolio and will further drive supplemental health growth within Specialty Benefits.In Retirement net cash flow was pressured in the second quarter due to an uptick in large plan lapses. Large plan sales and lapses fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and can have a significant impact on net cash flow, but they generally have a lower overall impact on revenue for our Retirement business. Looking at the SMB segment within retirement, net cash flow was a positive $265 million, driven by a 16% increase in transfer deposits and a 9% increase in recurring deposits, stronger results than the overall block compared to the year ago quarter. We expect retirement sales to pick up in the second half of the year with strong full year growth across the SMB and large plan segments. We remain focused on driving profitable growth in RIS leveraging our leading market position and full suite of retirement solutions. We continue to expect to be within our net revenue growth and margin guidance for the full year.Bottom line, we are excited about the growth opportunities across the enterprise. I'm confident that our focus on the high-growth markets, combined with our differentiated product suite and distinct set of distribution partnerships will continue to drive value for our customers and our shareholders. Deanna?Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutThanks, Dan. Good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I will share the key contributors to financial performance for the quarter, details of our current financial and capital position and an update on our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. Our second quarter results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our diversified business model. Despite real estate-related market pressures on a number of key metrics, including total company variable investment income, as well as PGI net cash flow and revenue, we're starting to see signs of recovery and positive momentum in real estate in the broader investor market. Reported net income was $389 million in the second quarter. Excluding income from exited businesses, net income was $325 million with manageable credit losses of $37 million. Credit drift was a positive $5 million in the quarter.On a year-to-date basis, credit drift has been a slight benefit to capital. We still feel good about our full year expectations for credit drift and losses despite the banking sector challenges earlier this year. Excluding significant variances, second quarter non-GAAP operating earnings were $415 million or $1.69 per diluted share. As detailed on Slide 12, significant variances had a net negative impact on our second quarter non-GAAP operating earnings of $53 million pretax, $39 million after tax and $0.16 per diluted share. The significant variances included lower-than-expected variable investment income in RIS, Principal International and Benefits and Protection as well as unfavorable impacts in Principal International from inflation and noneconomic LDTI discount rate impacts. Variable investment income was positive in total for the quarter and at a similar level as the first quarter. Prepayment fees and real estate sales were immaterial, causing VII in total to be lower than our run rate expectation. Macroeconomics were generally favorable in the second quarter as the S&amp;P 500 daily average increased 5% from the first quarter and 2% from the second quarter of 2022. The benefit to our fee-based businesses from this positive performance was partially offset by a decline in daily averages for small cap, mid-cap and international equities as well as fixed income.Foreign exchange rates were a modest tailwind on a quarterly basis relative to the first quarter and the second quarter of 2022, but remain a meaningful headwind of $12 million pretax on a trailing 12-month basis. We continue to focus on managing expenses with pressured fee revenue across the enterprise. Through these efforts, compensation and other expenses have decreased at the enterprise level compared to a year ago despite inflationary pressures on salary levels and other expenses.As a reminder, comparisons to a year ago are impacted by the reinsurance transactions that closed in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding significant variances, revenue growth and margins across the businesses were in line with our second quarter expectations and within our guidance ranges, with the exception of PGI revenue growth. Compared to a year ago, PGI performance fees and transaction and borrower fees were down approximately $50 million on a gross basis, pressuring revenue, margin and pretax operating earnings. This decrease was anticipated in our full year guidance ranges. PGI's quarterly margin of 35% was within our 34% to 37% guided range and improved from the seasonally low first quarter. Specialty Benefits pretax operating earnings, excluding significant variances, increased 29% over the year ago quarter, fueled by growth in the business, including an 8% increase in premium and fees and improved loss ratios driven by strong underwriting and disability and group life. Turning to capital and liquidity, we remain in a strong financial position. We ended the second quarter with $1.2 billion of excess and available capital, including approximately $800 million at the holding company, which is at our targeted level, $340 million in our subsidiaries, and $100 million in excess of our targeted 400% risk-based capital ratio. We returned $255 million to shareholders in the second quarter, including $100 million of share repurchases and $155 million of common stock dividends, and we retired $700 million of long-term debt during the quarter using the proceeds from issuances in the first quarter. As expected, we generated strong free capital flow in the second quarter and remain focused on 75% to 85% free capital flow conversion for the full year.Last night, we announced a $0.65 common stock dividend payable in the third quarter. This is a $0.01 increase and is in line with our targeted 40% dividend payout ratio. We remain focused on maintaining our capital and liquidity targets at both the life company and the holding company, and we'll continue pursuing a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment.As shown on Slide 5, our investment portfolio remains high quality, aligned with our liability profile and well positioned for a variety of economic conditions. Specific to our real estate portfolio, it is high quality and positioned well to withstand potential economic stress. We revalued the portfolio again in the second quarter, reflecting the most recent cash flows and other underlying data. The commercial mortgage loan portfolio remains healthy. The current average loan-to-value is low at 47% and debt service coverage ratio is strong at 2.5x. This is relatively unchanged from the first quarter and significantly improved from 2008 levels. Turning to our office exposure within the CML portfolio, it is geographically diverse and high quality. A 100% of the year-to-date 2023 maturities have been paid off, and we are confident in the outcome of the remaining 4 office loans maturing in 2023. Throughout 2023, we are actively revaluing the entire office portfolio each quarter. As of the second quarter, we have cumulatively reduced the portfolio valuation by 25% from the peak. Our current valuation is approximately 23% below the implied index value, highlighting our conservative approach relative to the broader market. The current loan-to-value on our office portfolio increased slightly to 57% as we further reduce valuations, while the debt service coverage ratio improved to 2.6x. We have the experience and a long-established track record of navigating real estate cycles. We are confident in the quality of our real estate portfolio and remain diligent in monitoring it and proactive in servicing it. It is high quality, well diversified and a good fit for our liability profile. We continue to be focused on maximizing our growth drivers of retirement, global asset management, and benefits and protection which will continue to deliver long-term growth for the enterprise and long-term shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Jefferies.Suneet Laxman L. KamathI wanted to start with RIS-Fee. If I think -- if my notes are right, I mean, I think this is the third quarter in a row where we've seen some large case outflows. And I get that these sometimes are low fee. But just wondering, is there something common about these outflows that we've seen over the past 3 quarters in terms of the type of cases or where it's going? Just some additional color on that and what the outlook is for large cash flows kind of going forward?Daniel Joseph HoustonYes. Good morning, Suneet, really appreciate the call or the question, and I'll have Chris get right into it.Christopher James LittlefieldGreat. Thanks, Suneet. Thanks for the question. I think there's a wide range. I think as we expressed in the prior quarters, one of the -- they were limited to a couple of large ones. One was a decision that we have made, with respect to whether it was a good fit for our business and the other was a choice by the plan sponsor. And so when you look at the reasons for the last -- was in the large case, you just see a lot of volatility in the activity. And a lot of reasons for the losses. We see M&amp;A activity that's impacting it. We're seeing a difference in the experience following the transition onto the platform. A reluctance to make changes to make the plan more streamlined or a change in pricing. So there's a wide range of reasons why these lapses are occurring. And so we certainly have seen the increase in large case lapses. That has really been offset by continued strength on the SMB side. So I don't want to lose the fact that we see much great resilience there with recurring deposits up 9% and transfer deposits up 16%. And I think the other thing you're seeing in the first half of the year, you're seeing a little bit of timing activity. I think as Dan pointed out, we see really good momentum heading into the second half, again, speaking to some of that volatility of large case activity. And so I think we sit really in a good position there. And while we -- I mean when we think about the pipeline, we have a healthy pipeline, increase our activity -- RFP activity, we see strong sales growth for the full year across SMB and large. But there is that volatility in large plan activity. And we do expect some additional pressure on that lapse activity in the second half. It's really difficult to give you an outlook because, as you know, the second half is a very active period of time for plan change activity. And so it's really difficult, and you can have things that you think are going to transition in December and move to January. So it's really hard to predict. But again, we will see strong growth for the full year across SMB in large, but we do see some additional pressure lapses.Daniel Joseph HoustonDoes that help, Suneet?Suneet Laxman L. KamathYes, that does. And then my second question is just on PGI, I guess, would love a little bit more perspective on your confidence in terms of flows improving in the second half. Maybe a read on what you're seeing so far early in the third quarter. And sort of relatedly, we have noted that the fee rate has been kind of coming down over time. And just curious if that trend -- do you expect that trend to persist going forward? Or should we expect that to sort of inflect?Daniel Joseph HoustonOne thing we know for sure, Suneet, is in that wealth management retail space, there's a lot of money that's gone to the sidelines on money market and bank deposits. And yet as we look through there and look at some of our asset management capabilities that we discussed in our earlier comments -- prepared comments, we do feel really good about the second half of the year. But with that, I'll have Pat respond accordingly.Patrick Gregory HalterThanks for the question. As Dan mentioned, we are very constructive on the second half of this year in terms of our outlook relative to net cash flow. As you can imagine, the market tone has very much improved. We're starting to see momentum in terms of capital raising, and that's playing into our strong capabilities and the sort of suite of capabilities that we can offer in a marketplace that now has a little more about a flow toward risk on assets. Let me start off with just some of our capabilities and where I see our capabilities relative to meeting those sort of growing flows. First is in real estate. As you know, we've had a very strong, I think, sort of capability in real estate. And that's really starting to see some increasing activity as the market start to get to a better place in terms of valuations. As Dan highlighted, we have a $7 billion unfunded committed capital position in real estate now. So we're well positioned to take advantage of the markets as they develop. And you probably will see us increasing our net cash flow reporting in the second half of the year as we go to that. And there's probably 3 areas you're going to see. The first one is probably in our increased activity in terms of acquisitions. We actually are pursuing a very large portfolio as we speak in terms of an acquisition. That should create, I think, a very strong net cash flow in the second half of the year. You're also seeing because we are a very strong sort of high-performing manager in real estate. We're actually seeing takeover existing portfolios from poor performing managers. We think that's a new area for us in terms of potential net cash flow. And then the third is just our normal increase in activities from funding of our institutional funds and institution investors are starting to get back engaged in the marketplace again. So very positive and constructive on that front and not just in the U.S. but in Europe and also in terms of some of the activity now that we have developed in terms of China with our joint venture in China with CCB, and that's in the industrial space.On the public market, Suneet, really, the investment performance that Dan highlighted has given us greater confidence that, again, obviously public asset classes, equities and fixed income with this favorable market sentiment that's developing. And we're always seeing this in terms of positive net cash flow in July. But we're seeing money deployed into things like Aligned our mid-cap strategy. We're positive about that. In our income specialty capabilities like high yield, we're seeing, I think, positive activity there.So I think the results should be less muted to redemptions, increase in sales, in our mutual funds and hopefully in our SMA strategy going forward. And then I think we're constructive on that also. PI is actually off to a good start also both in Southeast Asia and in Latin America, particularly Brazil. So I think the second half of the year, if the markets continue to behave relatively well, we are constructive on growth, and I think we have some early indicators that we should be constructive on growing. Relative to your second question, Suneet, in terms of base management fees, I think one of the things that we're very proud of is to manage to that 29 basis point base management fee that we've had for many years, frankly. Obviously, as you highlighted, it's dipped a little bit to 28.4 basis points. I think that's somewhat due to the quarterly decrease in the flows we had in the second quarter, and that's driven by the mix of business as net cash flows were leaving at higher rates of return than our average block and that's why you saw that diminution in the 29% to 28.4%. But as I kind of think about the trailing 12 months, and then I look forward, trailing 12 months have been strong at 28.9%.And as I just highlighted in terms of constructive outlook relative to the activity for the second half of the year, back half of the year. We do think we can really improve that 28.4% back to the 29% range. And that's our expectation as we look forward into the second half of the year, particularly if the equity markets continue to stay where they're at and we continue to see the mix of assets that we think we can garner and the net cash flow discussion has provided to you, Suneet.Daniel Joseph HoustonJust one comment I want to follow up on with regards to Chris' explanation when he said M&amp;A just for those less informed on this. In the SMB market, there's not a lot of M&amp;A in the large case market, there does tend to be a lot of that. A lot of times, these are publicly traded companies or large private companies. And when the much larger plan comes in and acquires that smaller organization, we could be the smaller organization, oftentimes, it goes to the acquiring company, and there was a fair amount of that activity, and that's probably a new narrative for us as we've had more large, as our large plan market has grown at Principal.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW.Ryan Joel KruegerI had a follow-up on real estate. Just, I guess, level set, like can you give us some perspective on what your real estate flows were in the first half of the year? I think they're included in the alternatives line that you provide, but I'm not sure if there's other impacts in there as well.Daniel Joseph HoustonYes. That's exactly right.Patrick Gregory HalterYes. So Ryan, in terms of the close in the first half of the year, they were muted relative to our historical sort of flow analysis. And I would suggest to you that will change in the second half of the year, as I highlighted in my comments. Those flows were in the $450 million range relative to the net cash flows. If you look historically over the last 5, 6 years, we've averaged about $3 billion a year in net cash flow. And I'm anticipating that we could be looking at something along what we typically have had as I think about the full year in 2023. And I hope that gives you a little bit of indication of our constructive view of our second half of the year.Ryan Joel KruegerThat's great. And then on buybacks, they came down a little bit in the quarter, and I recognize a lot of market volatility probably earlier in the quarter. So just hoping to get a little more perspective on if you may ramp up buybacks a little bit more versus the second quarter level in the second half of the year.Daniel Joseph HoustonAnd we have full intentions on delivering on our full year outlook, but I'll have Deanna provide some additional context on the quarter.Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutYes. Thanks, Ryan, where you ended there is exactly right. Obviously, early in the quarter, we were all seeing heightened credit and macro concerns driven by the banking and the real estate cycles. And obviously, even though we felt confident on our full year free cash flow, we wanted to be prudent as we saw those concerns play out. I think if you look at our excess capital roll forward, that does point to strong free cash flow. It also points to the fact that we do still have that. And so again, it's much more of a timing issue than it is any issue with our capital levels or free capital flow outlook for the rest of the year. So I'd heighten back to what I talked about last year. I think we still feel that approximately $600 million of buybacks for the full year is a good range. And if you then take into account what we've done, that does point to slightly higher buybacks in the back half of the year.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.Thomas George GallagherQuestion on variable investment income. Pat, just listening to what you're saying about real estate pipeline and how you expect more of those flows to be coming through. I'm curious if we should also take that to mean transaction activity on your owned real estate might start picking back up again and could drive better variable investment income returns. Curious what you're thinking there for the back half of the year? Would you still expect VII to be below plan? Or do you think the clouds might be lifting here a bit?Daniel Joseph HoustonTom, I'll tell you what I think, I'll have Deanna respond accordingly on that one.Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutYes. Just a couple of comments there, and then I'll have Pat add some color. I actually think we'll see inflows into real estate before we see transaction volume in real estate. So I think our outlook would probably still see some muted results in variable investment income due to real estate sales in the second half of the year. What we've seen thus far in VII, very similar results in the first quarter and second quarter, virtually no prepays, virtually no real estate sales, but actually pretty strong and in-line returns from our all portfolio. And I think what you would say is it is hard to forecast. Maybe towards the end of the year, we might see some transactions. But again, that might also roll into early '24 as well. So probably our best guess right now is that third and fourth quarter VII would be similar to what we saw in the first half of the year. But Pat, any thoughts on transactions.Patrick Gregory HalterYes. I just mentioned, Tom, that I think, as you know, we have a pipeline of opportunities in terms of investments that we're developing. And those usually are sort of the merchant build program that allows for variable investment income to be generated in the future. And my anticipation, you'll start to see more of that in 2024 than in 2023. But there is a pipeline out there, and we're obviously harvesting that pipeline for the right time to sort of to optimize that. But my guess, Tom, would be more 2024 than the next 2 quarters.Thomas George GallagherOkay. And then my follow-up is, I guess, for Chris or Dan, just curious about a bigger picture competitive landscape within 401(k) and large case. Are you seeing -- when you're losing these cases, is it mainly going to large asset managers? Is it insurance companies? And I heard you mention that's partly just driven by M&amp;A. But just curious what's happening on pricing. Like are you noticing any more aggressive pricing? Is it the same? Just any color on what you're seeing competitively would be helpful.Daniel Joseph HoustonTom, as you very well know, this has been and continues to be a competitive marketplace. We actually differentiate ourselves in leveraging our TRS capabilities, and you see that through the nonqualified deferred compensation growth, you see that through ESOP and our ability to attract these large DB plans as well. As Chris framed earlier, it is M&amp;A. It's -- whether it's a good fit or not. There's still a little bit of a shake out relative to the IRT transfer block of business and whether that's a perfect alignment with our service model. But Chris is closer to it, I'll ask that he add some additional color.Christopher James LittlefieldI mean I think it's a very competitive market. And I think as we've expressed in the past, our focus is really managing on profitable growth and maintaining our pricing discipline and driving additional revenue and managing our expense discipline really well. And so that's where our focus is. I mean not all flows are created equal, and they come with different revenue and profit profiles, and we're really focused on how do we maximize revenue generation and profitability rather than how do we maximize flows. The competitive environment is competitive, but we're maintaining pricing discipline. I think it really shows up in the fact that we are very confident that we're going to land within the full year guidance for net revenue, and we expect to be in the upper half, the top end of our margin guidance for the year, and that's how we're managing the business.Daniel Joseph HoustonWe'll also say, Tom, just to maybe clean up just a little bit, among the top 3 players in this industry, we all keep getting larger, without naming names, there is a fair amount of swapping of these plans between the relative players, we win from the large players, we lose large players and TRS is still a big differentiator out there as well as our customer service platform. So hopefully, that helps.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.Erik James BassI was hoping you could talk a little bit about the net flow dynamics in the RIS spread business. You're seeing nice wins in PRT and growth in deposits. The flows have been a little bit muted there due to higher withdrawals. Is this just a function of having a larger blocks and needing more sales to offset the natural runoff? Or are there any other dynamics to think about?Daniel Joseph HoustonI think to be the biggest dynamic there is to make sure you remain disciplined in your pricing as you attract new business. And there is a steady roll off, as you would expect, Chris, you want to add some additional thoughts?Christopher James LittlefieldYes. On our spread-based net cash flow, it was flat in the quarter. We certainly saw the strong PRT sales. I'd point out that those are really nice returns. And so we continue to see compelling opportunities there, but that was offset by some of the [GA] flows due to better equity markets. Certainly, when you see better equity market performance, you see a movement out of capital preservation products, and we certainly saw that in the second quarter. The other trend I'd highlight is, as you know, we run our investment-only business, our IO business opportunistically. And so the maturities can be lumpy, and we certainly experienced some lumpiness in some outflows in this quarter contributing to the flat performance on spread-based net cash flow.Erik James BassGot it. And then going back to PGI. I was hoping, Pat, you can talk a little bit more about the retail demand and flow dynamics that you're seeing. And in particular, curious as money is coming back to the market. Are you seeing it go back into actively managed funds to the same degree as it was before? Or is passive continuing to take share?Patrick Gregory HalterYes, Erik, I think that the passive sort of share of the marketplace continues to increase. And that's why the investment performance numbers that we illustrated in our prepared remarks is so important, because we have to be able to demonstrate that we are producing an active return over those indices. And so we do feel with those numbers improving on the investment side, we should start to see the trajectory, our senior trajectory, frankly, in the first 2 weeks of July in terms of our ability to get a little more of the mind share of the law in terms of flows going into active mutual funds. It's a tough sort of marketplace in that yet to deliver really first 1/3 sort of investment profile performance to get that wallet share. With some of our improving investment performance, we're seeing some of that increased activity, as I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks on the net cash flow. SMA is a space that we continue to want to grow in. Mutual funds is clearly a place that we've been very active with in terms of over the years, and really the place where I think we have an opportunity to grow again is in CITs. There has been a little bit of a pushback on CITs in terms of net cash flow because of that always pointed how to save a value back in the equity markets. We think that's sort of a temporary sort of situation. But that's sort of the landscape of what we're seeing right now relative to the retail space and the retirement individual space, Erik. Hopefully, that helps.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of John Barnidge with Piper Sandler.John Bakewell BarnidgeCan you maybe talk about the sales volume in Specialty Benefits, I know there's a second straight quarter of declines. Is it that '22 had a bunch of pent-up demand that's creating tough comparables? Or can you maybe -- are you seeing other things.Daniel Joseph HoustonYes. I appreciate that, John. And no doubt, we had a very strong '22 and '22 is strong, just not equally as strong. But Amy, you want to go and add some additional color?Amy Christine FriedrichYes, sure, happy to add some color here. So John, I think you're hitting on one of the main points here, which is there definitely was pent-up demand, particularly in the smaller market kind of flowing through 2022 results. So when you look at the sort of fierce labor fight out there, sort of fierce fight for talent. There were smaller market players kind of making some purchases out there that really did represent that pent-up demand. So that was definitely good news in our 2022 results.But to put in perspective, I view our 2023 second quarter results as really strong. They are down, as you note from 2022, but they are literally the second best second quarter sales we've ever recorded. So when I look at those sales, I see really good things for both the current quarter and looking ahead. So when I look ahead at that second half of the year, as Dan mentioned in his comments, we have introduced a new Hospital Indemnity product. It's performing well, rounding out our supplemental health offering. And when I look at the basics, the fundamentals of our business around staffing, process, technology, distributor relationships, those are really strong right now. So again, I would say it's more a comparability issue that we're seeing. I'm very comfortable with both our total premium and fee growth and the sales component of that.John Bakewell BarnidgeAnd then my follow-up question, maybe on that Hospital Indemnity product, can you talk about how you think about the maybe TAM or total addressable market and the SMB space for that? And then the product pipeline as well for other products that you may be working on.Amy Christine FriedrichSure. Dan, happy to take that. So when I think about Hospital Indemnity, it really is not one product that's going to sit out there and kind of do the work by itself. It really is going to sit as a supplement to the core benefits that we already have in place. So what we're seeing is that it's a nice offering to fill some gaps. So when people have a hospitalization when people have other needs that are going to be travel-related or outside of something that would get covered by the medical plan. This is going to be something that helps with that supplemental hospitalization costs and pieces. So I see it as a complement. The real power in having this is that it rounds out the rest of our worksite portfolio. So we've historically seen much of our organic growth, relying on that basic kind of product sets that are going to be dental and disability and life. And I love having those product sets in place, but where we haven't put our competition out there as much has been in the worksite space. So as we bundle up accident and critical illness and Hospital Indemnity, it's going to give us the ability to compete on some of those additional worksite sales that we simply haven't been as competitive in the past. So I like what that says in terms of the market applicability. I like what that does in terms of how it can help us grow our total wallet share that we have across our extensive small and midsize business customers.Daniel Joseph HoustonWe do the survey work with employers, small, medium and large. The one thing we consistently hear is health care is probably one of the most important. Second is around retirement, but supplemental benefits like this are strong number 3. And so we see this as a real growth driver for our small- to medium-sized segment...OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Wes Carmichael with Wells Fargo.Wesley Collin CarmichaelI just wanted to follow up on the performance fees in PGI. I know in the supplement, you provide that, it's down quite a bit year-over-year. I know Dan you addressed that. But just curious for your outlook for the remainder of the year, how you think that should trend in, I guess I'm trying to -- does that kind of tie to your comments on VII where you need to see the inflows first. I think some of the fees in PGI are related to real estate transaction activity.Daniel Joseph HoustonYes. Pat can clarify that for us.Patrick Gregory HalterYes. So those are the 2 different sort of discussions between VII and then the performance fees that would come to PGI and be part of the operating earnings profile of PGI. But we do, as I mentioned, because of the activity increases we see in real estate, Wes, we would expect sort of the muted performance fee that we saw in the first half of the year to start to change. And second half of the year, you should see some more sort of robust performance fees coming into the second half of the year.Wesley Collin CarmichaelGot it. And then on capital in the holding company, sitting at the $800 million level of liquidity. Just curious if you're kind of expecting to run that near the target there? Or if you expect to leave some excess there over time? And also just on the leverage ratio, it's down now when you took out $700 million of debt. Just curious if that's going to migrate back towards 25% over time or if you want to be a little bit lower on towards that target?Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutYes, I'll answer your second question first. So on a leverage ratio perspective. It was really just an anomaly given the fact that we issued $700 million of debt in the first quarter, and we paid off the $700 million of debt in the second quarter. And so if you would have adjusted for that, we would have been consistent at that 22% level. I think, again, our target is 20% to 25%, but I think that 22% is a really good place to be, gives us some dry powder if there is opportunities. And I think that's what you'll see us consistently show there. Regarding your other question around the holdco, we actually spent an extensive amount of time with our Board Finance Committee on a quarterly basis, we look at our capital at risk. And given the change in our business mix and some of the transactions that we conducted in 2022, the need to hold a lot of cushion relative to that is not as needed as it has been in the past. And so I think you'll see that around a pretty tight range around that $100 million. Obviously, if we're seeing big pressures in the market, it might flex a little bit up. But I think given our business mix as well as the high level of free cash flow that we generate, I don't think you'll see that move significantly one way or the other. I hope that helps, Wes.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.Jamminder Singh BhullarI had a question first on just PGI flows. And I think Pat, in your comments, you mentioned sort of a little bit of an improvement in the overall environment, but wanted to see how much of your optimism on flows improving in the second half is because of actual commitments you received from clients versus maybe the improved performance or just an expectation that activity will get better?Daniel Joseph HoustonI think it's 2 things, I'll throw out to Pat quickly. Number one, the investment performance helps out immensely. And then secondly, we already feel good about here in the first month of the third quarter and what we're seeing with solid flows. But Pat, please?Patrick Gregory HalterYes, Jimmy, thanks for the question. Just to highlight Dan's last comment there. Principal International was off to a very strong start in July. So that's very encouraging in terms of its flows. And then we discussed, we have seen a turnaround in terms of some of the retail flows. And it's looking much more constructive, again, because of the investment performance. Obviously, 1 month doesn't make a trend for the rest of the year. But based on the market sentiment, based on the conversations we're having with the clients and with the markets themselves, there is definitely flows and the increasing flows are out there. And so we're encouraged by that anticipated pipeline of activity. On the real estate side, just to be clear, those discussions I highlighted in terms of acquisition portfolios, taking over existing portfolios, funding in terms of new funds. That's real capital commitment. That's actually money that's been committed. So we're very encouraged by the opportunities to change that into a strong net cash flow.Jamminder Singh BhullarOkay. And then on -- you discussed performance fees, but if we look at asset management fees in the PGI business or just a normal management fee revenues, those are down as well. So are they down more because of just rates and the impact of that on assets? Or are there other factors going on that might be more sort of sustainable in nature?Patrick Gregory HalterYes. So we discussed earlier based asset management fees and that little bit point down from 29% to 28.4%. We did see a little bit of lower transaction fees in the first half of the year, Jimmy. So maybe that's what you're also highlighting, but that was fairly limited. Our mortgage activity, our mortgage origination activity actually has started to increase in June. That's increasing again in July. So we're actually expecting transaction fees to probably get back to more of a historical level than what we've seen in the past. And then as I mentioned, performance fees, very light in terms of performance fees in the first half of the year. But we do expect performance fees to probably get more back to the normal level than what you've seen in the past relative to PGI.Jamminder Singh BhullarOkay. And then any comments on just competition and fee pressure in asset management? Is that same as before? Or has there been any change in it?Patrick Gregory HalterYes, Jimmy. Yes, there's always intense competition in the asset management business. That's why we have to continue to deliver strong alpha performance. That's why you have to continue to make sure we have relevant capabilities globally, the fee pressure is absolutely there in the marketplace. So we have to continue to make sure we are building on value to our clients, in the eyes of the clients in terms of the capabilities we offer and then the level of performance that those capabilities are generating.Daniel Joseph HoustonJim, as you very well know, it isn't just active back like the good old days, with passive taking more of the share, you don't have value-added capabilities you're not winning. And the good news at Principal, whether it's in the high-yield space, preferred space, real estate, direct lending. These are areas where we can differentiate. And it is our intention to continue to build out those unique capabilities to compete in the marketplace. Hopefully, that helps.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.Taylor Alexander ScottFirst one I have for you all is just maybe a high-level question on inflation and how it's affecting your expenses. I mean, certainly, there's some help up to the top line from what's been going on in the market. How do we think through inflation as a potential offset to some of the help that you're getting just in terms of top line and the economy, the market potentially continuing to recover a bit versus the inflationary pressures that could offset some of that.Daniel Joseph HoustonI'll make some initial comments and then ask Deanna. But, no, we've talked about this here before as a matter of fact, when inflation started to tick up in particular it relates to wage inflation, which most employers are happy to deal with as it relates to of maintaining an attractive recruiting talent. And we see that manifest itself in higher dollar amounts of wages often translates into higher dollar amounts of life insurance coverage, higher premiums, for disability, all of those again are tied back to wages. Individuals, as I see salary increases, most of those are set in automatic nature and so 401(k) salary deferrals rise accordingly. And on a net-net basis, Principal is always the benefactor, as you pointed out, that top line revenue growth. Principal has its own internal challenges related to inflation as we retain and attract talent. And again, that's part of our overall expense management responsibility within the business units and something that Deanna works with the CFOs around here every day on. But maybe I'll have Deanna add some additional thoughts here?Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutYes, Alex, thanks for the question. I think Dan really talked about well that we do -- we are uniquely positioned that when inflation place through, especially when it plays through on salary levels, we do get benefit in both RIS and benefits and protection. And obviously, that plays through from a revenue perspective. We definitely have a proven track record of aligning expenses with revenue. When revenue goes down very fast or goes up very fast, there's always a natural lag but one thing I'm really proud of is if you look at our comp and other, whether it be relative to a year ago quarter, relative to last quarter or relative on a trailing 12-month basis, they're down on all of those comparisons. Probably more -- most valid is on a trailing 12-month basis. We're seeing about a 3% to 4% decrease in adjusted comp and other. And that's despite the fact that, as you mentioned, we have had to increase salaries because of that inflationary pressure and more on talent, we've had other expenses that have been negatively impacted from inflation. And also, we have to make sure that we continue to invest in our businesses to make sure that we can continue to deliver on our promises and drive growth in the future. And so I think that's the proof of the fact that we do have that track record, and you'll continue to see that play out as we go forward.Taylor Alexander ScottGot it. That's helpful. Follow-up question I have is on dental. Just noticing the loss ratio was up a little bit. Are you guys seeing anything around utilization may be like a procedures, that kind of thing. I guess I've heard some of the managed care providers talk about this. And I don't think it was still focused on dental some of the comments, but I think one of them mentioned dental. So I was just interested if that's something you're seeing.Daniel Joseph HoustonYes, I'll have Amy take that. Before I do that, just a reminder, when you compare Principal to other competitors in our set, we're not a pure-play asset manager. So we do have operations and more customer service expense. And so on pure-play asset managers when you have more variable expense because it's instead of compensation and so on and so forth, you see expense reductions perhaps a little bit easier than you do in an organization like Principal when we're providing a lot of value-added services across these fee spread and risk businesses. But I think it is always important to put that in the proper context when you're doing your comparable. So with that, Amy, dental?Amy Christine FriedrichYes. So just a few comments about dental, definitely feel good about our overall loss ratio and margins. So when you talk about the full suite of products, I feel really good about how they're operating together. When we dig in just on dental, we are seeing some things happen there that are a little bit, I would call them sort of out of seasonal patterns. And so I think we are still seeing the first half of the year is some definite keeping up on utilization and frequency, people are going to the dentist back to prepandemic levels. But we're probably still seeing a little more severity flow through our results. So think of that as the higher dollar procedures. The open question out there in the industry is will that be continuing on? Is that setting a new level? Or is that something that's still sort of the last remnant of the pandemic. So my particular belief and the belief on our block of business is that we'll see that experience moderate through the second half of the year. I think we will continue to see that come down. We might see some elevation still in severity, but the great news about our block is that our block is about 90% of it is going to have an annual ability to get rerated and renewable. So dental is a very responsive product if we need it to be on things that are happening within how it's being utilized and changed. So great news is that's a short lip if that does happen. But my perspective is I do think we'll see that moderate a bit. And I think we're seeing some of the last remnants from the pandemic coverage being disrupted, but more to come.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays.Tracy Dolin-BenguiguiWithin to your comments, it sounds like we're reaching an inflection point on real estate. We saw some pressure this quarter on some of your key metrics. But then you said you're seeing signs of recovery and positive momentum in real estate like in PGI or mortgage origination activity is up. What is going on in real estate fundamentals that's driving that? Or is it more technical?Patrick Gregory HalterSo I think what's driving the sort of activity is there's places where we're starting to see the entry points in terms of where the risk return trade-off looks reasonable again? So there's a sort of an opportunity there, both in terms of core real estate, but also manufacturing real estate in terms of turnaround and in the development. We also, I think, are very, I think, mindful that the debt markets have to stabilize.And with the Fed now starting to become, I think, maybe at a place where they may take a pause, I think people are having a little more confidence in terms of being able to understand where the path will be going forward in terms of valuations and debt availability and capital availability. So there is a sort of emerging market developing in terms of this transaction in general picking up, it's still early yet, but being early sometimes is where you actually can really add value to your clients. And so there is an opportunity, as I mentioned, through the 3 areas that we have been very active in, which is acquiring a portfolio or taking over other managers' assets or being able to find funding for new creative things to invest in, for instance, like data centers. So there's a lot of interesting opportunities. I know office has headline, and we're not in the office. We're not investing in new office, but we are investing in other asset classes, whether it's industrial, whether it's data centers, whether it's residential. So that's really the important thing to mention as to where we're at, what we're doing, as we talk about this increased activity.Tracy Dolin-BenguiguiYes. A quick follow-up. I just want to touch on the credit cycle. You mentioned credit drift has a slight benefit of capital. Do you feel good about your full year expectations where you were building in some credit drift. What do you think is going on? This is probably the longest debate on whether we're going to enter a recession or not. Maybe as far back in 2019, we saw the credit cycle reach maturation. So what do you think is driving that positive drift? And is this a timing difference where we could see credit drift materializing, but it just may come later?Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutYes, just a few comments there. Let me just frame kind of where we are kind of year-to-date from a drift perspective and ultimately kind of tie it back to your questions there. Both first quarter and second quarter, we actually saw positive capital impact from drift to modest, about $5 million a quarter. And I think that really comes back to our high-quality, diversified portfolio. And so even though we are seeing some downgrades across the portfolio, they're more than being compensated by some upgrades. And again, that could be within the real estate portfolio on some of the asset classes that Pat mentioned or it's in other parts of our balance sheet as well. And so again, we do think there will be some drift as we go through the rest of the year. But I'd say there's a couple of things, right? I think the recession is not thought to be as deep as maybe what it was anticipated coming into the year. And then you come back to the quality and the diversification of our balance sheet. And I think, again, we continue to see good results there, but I'll see if Pat has anything to add.Patrick Gregory HalterNo, I think Dan has done a nice job of summing that up really well.OperatorOur final question this morning comes from the line of Mike Ward with Citi.Michael Augustus WardJust on PRT, we've been hearing pretty bullish commentary from some of the insurance brokers out there. It seems like more than usual. So just wondering if anything is changing in terms of the returns or there's got to be more competition. But any way to sort of size the opportunity from here?Christopher James LittlefieldYes. No, I think we see a very strong PRT market place right now. I think industry sales are expected to be in that $30 billion to $40 billion range for the year. Again, as we think about this business, we really focused on the returns we're getting on the capital we're investing in that business. And so we remain disciplined. And so we're very comfortable. We feel very good about our performance for the first half, and we're on track for our plan for the year, and we're doing so at very nice returns. The other thing I'd say is we do benefit from having our WSRS business. A lot of the activity that we're seeing, we're able to take our existing clients' plans given that clients are fully funded. I think Mercer is calling it 105% funding at the end of June. And we're able to talk to them about planned terminations and the opportunity to write PRT business with them. And if we just look at that overlap between those businesses, about 15% of our premium and about 42% of the cases in our PRT business year-to-date has come from existing clients. So just -- we do see a robust environment there. We're picking our spots where we can maximize the return on capital. We have some built-in advantages from having an existing client base.Daniel Joseph HoustonFinal question, Mike?Michael Augustus WardMaybe just on Specialty Benefits. Just wondering what you guys are sort of hearing and feeling from the employers out there, how they feel about the labor market and wages and how they're -- if their attitude is changing in terms of their approach to benefits.Amy Christine FriedrichYes. So I think the good news there is that the small to midsized marketplace is still really vibrant. They understand that they need to keep talent. They understand that a great benefits and savings and retirement package offering for their employees is critical to making that happen for them. And they're displaying that through their purchasing behavior and their funding and persistence on those plans. And so I think the most interesting piece is that when you look at employment growth and you look at wage growth, wage growth is across all of the segments that we're seeing equally present in the small market but employment growth, at least in our block of business, and I think this is cross over into the retirement business as well has stayed really strong. So our employment growth numbers are twice as strong, 3 times as strong in the smaller market. So those employers are continuing to hire, and they're continuing to indicate that they need great employees to fuel the growth.So we continue to hear sentiment that there's caution. They're very confident about their businesses. They're also very confident about their kind of region or community. They get a little less confident in their sentiment when they head over into total U.S. or total global economy. So that's where their sentiment begins to start to fall apart, but their actions are usually based on their local or their business sentiment and it remains very positive.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Houston for any final comments.Daniel Joseph HoustonYes. Thanks again for joining us today. And as I reflect on the quarter, the earnings and the margins aligned with guidance, there's a path on the free cash flow of 75% to 80% net cash flow. We all know on a macro level, is a very challenging environment. We're making changes in the business in order to improve the results. We're continuing to focus on aligning expenses with revenues, and it continues to be a priority while still investing for growth and innovation and the digitizing of our business and making sure that we don't miss that opportunity, and we continue to execute on profitable growth for our long-term shareholders. So thank you for your time and attention today. We'll see you out on the road.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Safe Haven Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.US markets surged on July 12 after fresh data showed clear signs that inflation is cooling. This was yet another blow to analysts who were vehemently making predictions about recession for about a year now. Last month, after a separate report from the US government on economic data, Yardeni Research’s Ed Yardeni said that the “permabears will have to postpone their imminent recession yet again based on today’s batch of US economic indicators.” The analyst said that the “rolling recession” was becoming “rolling expansion.”Positive economic is also causing research institutes to improve their forecasts on the US economy. For example, Bloomberg’s survey of economists now expect real gross domestic product to be roughly flat next quarter on an annualized basis. This is much better than their previous forecast of a 0.9% decline.But all of this does not mean that the US economy is totally out of recession risk. In fact many believe the economy is still expected to suffer recession but later than expected. A Bloomberg survey still sees a 64% probability of a recession in the next 12 months.This is where defensive and safe haven investments come in. They are not for the recessions only. Wise investors pile into defensive stocks and safe haven assets to hedge against risks and volatility of the market. While gold is deemed as a safe haven asset, it failed to impress investors ever since the rate-hike spree began to hammer the financial markets. On the other hand, safe haven stocks such as defensive companies operating in evergreen sectors posted strong performance in 2022. An important thing to note here is that while billionaire investors showed an increased interest in safe haven and defensive stocks amid recession fears, many of the notable companies that are deemed defensive had been receiving love from billionaire hedge funds since way before the topic of recession started making headlines. Some examples of such solid stocks are Johnson &amp; Johnson, Coca Cola and UnitedHealth. These stocks have been popular among the elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey for years. These companies not only pay consistent dividends, they also have organic growth catalysts and products that are apparently safe from recession environment.Story continuesDespite positive data and a rally in stocks investors have been wary of going all in in the stock market. However, they are putting money in defensive ETFs. A WSJ report quoted Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street, who said:“There’s been a lack of expression of risk during this market rally. There hasn’t been a lot of conviction, and where there is, it’s mainly been into areas of the market you would consider defensive.”Defensive Stocks in Non-Recessionary Environment?When beginner investors make an effort to find defensive stocks, they often tend to focus on metrics like beta and the nature of industries. But data shows that low beta stocks are not always undervalued and one must pay attention to other metrics while choosing defensive plays. For example, when the stock market began to rally in 2023, defensive stocks fell, and their valuations became attractive. Even though the economy is coming out of recession risks, these defensive companies with strong fundamentals and great valuations are still attractive and could reward long-term investors who aren’t just looking for defensive stocks in panic to protect them from the next recession.A 2019 report from State Street Global Advisors mentions an interesting perspective in this regard:“Looking at the valuation of each of the conventionally defensive sectors, we see that the utilities and real estate segments as a whole are trading on a multiple of forecast earnings around 2 points higher than their long-term average. The utilities stocks in the low beta group on average are currently trading at a multiple of 19 times earnings, and the real estate and food &amp; beverage segments are trading at an average of 30 and 21 times earnings, respectively. When we think about investing defensively, risk measures are not enough. Valuation is also important, as are measures of financial strength, growth capability, or other measures of company quality. And the individual assessment of each stock is also not enough. Consideration of the interaction of stocks with one another (correlation) matters, too.”Despite the changing nature of market conditions, billionaire investors almost always maintain exposure to defensive stocks operating in industries like consumer staples, healthcare, utilities, energy, etc. The reason behind this is simple. Most of the notable defensive companies have stable, mature businesses. When financial markets get choppy and storms gather, defensive companies don’t waver. Asset management firm Robeco in a report mentioned that during the period between January 1929 to May 2023, defensive stocks were less volatile and had a lower risk profile when compare to cyclical stocks. The report said that defensive stocks (with beta value of 0.75) “respond less to market movements compared to cyclical stocks with a higher beta of 1.27. This lower sensitivity makes defensive stocks an attractive option for investors seeking to mitigate their exposure to market fluctuations.""Safe Haven Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnOur MethodologyFor this article, we first scanned the DEF - Invesco Defensive Equity ETF and listed all its holdings.

(NYSE:TJX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Also, shares of The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), an off-price retailer of apparel and home goods across North America, Europe and Australia, rose on strong Black Friday sales and market share gains as shoppers searched for deals in physical stores. The company showed that it is maintaining margins and beating earnings estimates on strong sales and by selectively raising prices. TJX’s business model is to sell brand name and designer merchandise in limited quantities at every day discounted prices in stores with flexible, low-cost layouts. Its strategy is to tap into shoppers’ psychological need to “treasure hunt,” as the company describes it, to find unique, branded items at deep discounts. TJX buyers opportunistically purchase merchandise from vendors at deep discounts to keep the cost of goods low for stores. As the largest off-price retailer, the company has used its channel power to its advantage in recent months to gain steep discounts on merchandise as other retailers struggle to clear their inventory. We appreciate the company’s inventory management and pricing  prowess. This holding is an example of our broad universe of companies that we consider for the portfolio and one that we believe is well-positioned for the current market environment.”7.

FIS and Colgate have both since “beat and raised” this guidance, indicating that many management teams are adopting very conservative tones in this uncertain macro environment.”6. Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV)Number of Billionaire Investors: 19Health insurance company Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) ranks 6th in our list of the best safe haven stocks billionaires are loading up on. Elevance Health, Inc.

Elevance is the largest for-profit Blue Cross Blue Shield plan in the country, supporting the largest domestic membership base across the managed care industry. While national scale is important, local scale is critical as well, given the localized nature of healthcare delivery. Elevance scores well on both fronts, giving it strong bargaining power with providers, lower customer acquisition costs, deep population health data and analytics, and the ability to offer attractive health benefit packages. All this combines to create a formidable moat for its business.We also believe the management team is top-notch. Since joining Elevance from a senior leadership position at peer UnitedHealth Group, CEO Gail Boudreaux has further leveraged the company’s scale advantage by expanding its internal healthcare services capabilities through a newly formed business unit called Carelon. As the industry transitions to a reimbursement system that emphasizes patient outcomes over procedure or testing volume, data analytics will be a crucial tool in managing patient care. Carelon has become the repository for many of these data analytics and healthcare service capabilities, and it should be an attractive growth platform for many years to come. Concerns around a possible slowdown in government-sponsored programs in Medicare Advantage and managed Medicaid gave us an opportunity to invest at a good price.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Safe Haven Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.

REGN is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 3, before the opening bell.The company has an impressive track record, with an earnings streak in all the past four quarters. In the last reported quarter, it beat earnings expectations by 9.08%. It surpassed earnings estimates by 17.06%, on average, in all the trailing four quarters.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayA major chunk of Regeneron’s revenues come from the sales of its lead drug, Eylea, which is approved for various ophthalmology indications (neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema and macular edema, among others). Eylea was developed in collaboration with Bayer AG.Regeneron records net product sales of Eylea in the United States, while Bayer records net product sales of the drug outside the country. Regeneron also records its share of profits/losses in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.However, Eylea sales have been under pressure in the last couple of quarters due to competition from Avastin and sale deductions. The second quarter is likely to have seen the same trend. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Eylea’s sales in the United States is pegged at $1.53 billion.Apart from Eylea, investors will focus on the asthma drug Dupixent’s performance, sales of which are recorded by Sanofi SNY. Regeneron has a collaboration agreement with Sanofi for drugs like Dupixent and Kevzara. While Sanofi records sales, Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of Dupixent and Kevzara. Profits from Dupixent sales have been REGN’s primary growth driver in the last few quarters.Sales of Dupixent were up 34.2% in the second quarter, as recorded by Sanofi and hence Regeneron is likely to have recorded incremental profits in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesDupixent has maintained its stellar performance, driven by continued strong demand in the approved indications, atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. The label expansion of the drug in the past few months has boosted sales further and is likely to have resulted in incremental revenues for Regeneron in the second quarter.Investors will focus on the performance of Libtayo and the PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent. Effective Jul 1, 2022, Regeneron records net product sales of Libtayo and pays Sanofi a royalty on such sales. Increased sales of Libtayo on-label expansions have most likely boosted the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Libtayo’s sales is pegged at $191 million.Regeneron records net product sales of Praluent in the United States. Sanofi records net product sales of the drug outside the United States and pays Regeneron a royalty on such sales. Total sales in the previous quarter witnessed a 31% increase and sales in the second quarter are likely to have maintained the momentum.In January 2022, the FDA revised the authorizations for a few monoclonal antibody treatments, including Regeneron’s REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab), as data indicated that these treatments are highly unlikely to be active against the Omicron variant. REGEN-COV is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies (casirivimab and imdevimab, also known as REGN10933 and REGN10987, respectively). Therefore, REGEN-COV is currently unauthorized for use in U.S. states, territories or jurisdictions.

355,969c5679-ee1d-3625-945e-447cb1b72638,UNP,2023-07-29,Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) Will Pay A Dividend Of $1.30,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacific-nyse-unp-pay-120848791.html,1690632528,STORY,['UNP'],"[The board of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $1.30 per share on the 29th of September. This makes the dividend yield 2.2%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific Union Pacific's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Union Pacific's earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 29.4%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 41%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendUnion Pacific Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.38, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $5.20. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 14% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.Dividend Growth Is DoubtfulInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Union Pacific has seen earnings per share falling at 5.3% per year over the last five years. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern.Our Thoughts On Union Pacific's DividendOverall, we think Union Pacific is a solid choice as a dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't raised this year. The earnings coverage is acceptable for now, but with earnings on the decline we would definitely keep an eye on the payout ratio. Taking all of this into consideration, the dividend looks viable moving forward, but investors should be mindful that the company has pushed the boundaries of sustainability in the past and may do so again.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the logistics industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Logistics Stocks to Buy.According to Precedence Research, the size of the logistics industry stood at $10.68 trillion at the end of 2022. The industry is set to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.48% to reach a size of $18.23 trillion by 2032. Meanwhile, London, UK-based professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) estimates that the logistics industry generates an estimated annual revenue of $4.6 trillion. Presently, the North American region dominates the logistics industry. The logistics industry can be broadly categorized into three notable groups based on their business models. A first-party logistics (1PL) provider is a basic form of logistics management where a company or organization handles its own logistics operations internally. A second-party logistics (2PL) provider comes into play when a company engages in a direct logistics partnership with another company. Meanwhile, a third-party logistics (3PL) provider is a dedicated entity that handles the transportation, inventory management, warehousing, and other services for any company.One of the main drivers in the growth of the global logistics industry is the boom in the e-commerce industry. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the contribution of e-commerce sales as part of total retail sales from 16% to 19% in 2020. Leading e-commerce companies like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), and PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) experienced their top-line increase by 70% between 2019 and 2021 and the total share of these prominent e-commerce platforms as a percentage of total global e-commerce sales increased from 75% in 2019 to 80% in 2021.  Such dynamic growth in the e-commerce industry has resulted in some of the biggest global logistics and shipping companies expanding their operations and investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), automated warehouses, the Internet of Things (IoT), predictive analysis, and real-time tracking.Story continuesThe logistics industry is anticipated to experience tailwinds as road connectivity in developing countries is now improving. This improvement in road connectivity is expected to offer greater upside potential to the best transportation stocks, such as CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX), FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP). One notable measure intended to give a boost to the industry is the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), also known as the New Silk Road, launched by China in 2013. The initiative includes a wide network of highways and railroads expanding into former Soviet countries in the West. Meanwhile, in the South, China intends to expand this network through its neighboring countries, Pakistan and India. China has been able to reach agreements with 147 countries of the world that are responsible for contributing two-thirds of the global gross domestic product (GDP). The biggest component of the BRI is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), with an estimated cost of $62 billion. To date, China has spent over $1 trillion on the BRI, with experts believing that the total outlay could reach $8 trillion by the time of completion. Investors seeking opportunities in the logistics sector are considering investing in trucking stocks with dividends and freight stocks.11 Best Logistics Stocks to BuyTravel mania/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe used Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 to shortlist the 11 best logistics stocks.

The possibility of Yellow Corporation (NASDAQ:YELL) heading towards bankruptcy or a restructuring with a smaller fleet is expected to be a positive development for LTL transportation providers like ArcBest Corporation (NASDAQ:ARCB). The company pays a quarterly dividend of 12 cents per share to its shareholders.9. XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Dollar Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $936,903,000XPO, Inc.

Following its late October spin-off of RXO, Inc., which provides freight brokerage services and last mile logistics, XPO has become a solid pureplay LTL company. During the period, shares of XPO outperformed after the RXO spin-off transaction was consummated in late October and helped unlock the sum of parts value as the market was undervaluing both assets. Moreover, shares of most LTL companies rallied from October to mid-November as part of a broader rally in cyclical stocks.”8. Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

(NASDAQ:JBHT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Dollar Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $786,246,000J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) is a Lowell, Arkansas-based logistics and truckload transportation services provider that came into being in 1961.In a note issued to investors on June 30, an analyst at Citi increased the price target on J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) from $200 to $207 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst anticipates modestly improving trends for the trucking industry during the second half of this year. There is a widespread belief that the truckload-levered transporters will see a bottom in Q2 2023.Wedgewood Partners shared its stance on J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“As we continue to familiarize our clients with our SMID portfolio’s holdings, we would like to discuss our significant exposure to the U.S. Transportation industry. We currently have three transportation holdings and have been substantially overweight the industry in comparison to the Russell 2500 index for several years. While these undoubtedly are cyclical business models, we see many long-term tailwinds for the domestic Transportation industry, which will provide attractive growth levels and will allow these companies to improve their returns on investment over time.J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) is the country’s largest independent provider of intermodal transportation services, with smaller businesses in trucking and logistics. Intermodal transportation refers to freight deliveries that require the use of more than one “mode” of transportation, most often including some combination of ocean, railroad, and truck between source and destination. J.B. Hunt generally provides the rail portion of these intermodal loads.J.B. Hunt benefited from the exacerbated shortage in Truckload capacity in both their intermodal business—where they could directly substitute railroad service for people who weren’t able to find TL capacity—and in their smaller, but rapidly growing Dedicated TL division, where the company takes over all or a portion of a shipping customer’s trucking fleet. While customers were paying significantly higher prices and still struggling to find any trucking capacity, they found it very attractive to contract for a dedicated, outsourced fleet with J.B. Hunt.”6. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Dollar Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $571,041,000Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.

Taking the benchmark borrowing rate to the highest in 22 years, interest rate is currently in the range of 5.25-5.5%.Inflation is gradually moving in a favorable direction as CPI for the month of June rose by 3% on a 12-month basis compared to 9.1% a year ago. However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has hinted at further rate hikes this year to tackle higher-than-targeted inflation of 2% over the long-term period.The possibilities of such a move are validated as the labor market is still strong. The payroll for June rose 209,000 while the unemployment rate fell to 3.6%, and average hourly wages rose 4.4%. Personal disposable income also increased 5.2% in the second quarter.By raising interest rates further, the Fed wants to cool off demand by making borrowing money more expensive. Currently, the borrowing cost is at a 16-year high, which will eventually impact corporate profitability. Such a move by the Fed will slow down the economy, according to its expectations, to counter inflation. Many economists fear a recession later this year if the Fed fails to create a soft landing for the economy.Prudent investors who wish to park their money for regular income and capital preservation in such critical situations can invest in dividend stocks. Due to their well-established businesses, these companies pay out regular dividends and remain profitable due to their proven business models. Companies that tend to reward investors with a high dividend payout outperform non-dividend-paying stocks during market volatility.On that note, let us look at companies like Rogers Communication RCI, STERIS STE, Ameriprise Financial AMP and Canadian National Railway CNI that have lately hiked their dividend payouts.Rogers Communication is a communications and media company.

361,7bec5cab-98da-3b05-801b-926fdc9cbbdb,GPS,2023-07-29,Gap Inc. used to be a bright spot for female leadership. Now it’s hired two male CEOs,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gap-inc-used-bright-spot-131321527.html,1690550001,STORY,['GPS'],"[Good morning, Broadsheet readers! Bumble devotes a new app to friends, Waymo goes all in on ride-hailing, and Gap Inc. hires two new CEOs. Have a restful weekend. - New hires. This week, Gap Inc. announced two new CEOs, one to lead its Athleta brand and one to run the whole retail business. The Gap Inc. role had sat vacant for more than a year, and Athleta has been without a permanent chief executive since March.Both of those roles were previously held by women: Gap Inc. CEO Sonia Syngal and Athleta CEO Mary Beth Laughton. The two new hires are both men.Richard Dickson, a Mattel alum credited with turning around the Barbie franchise, will lead Gap Inc. Chris Blakeslee, the former president of uber-hot brand Alo Yoga, will take over Athleta.The new hires are a stark departure from recent years in which Gap Inc. has leaned into women's leadership and serving its female customer base. Syngal left the company after its Old Navy brand stumbled when introducing inclusive sizing in stores, a groundbreaking if poorly executed initiative. And Athleta has made itself a cornerstone of women's empowerment, sponsoring athletes and launching lines with Allyson Felix, Simone Biles, and Alicia Keys.For those who care about women's representation among Fortune 500 leaders (currently at 10.4%), Syngal's 2022 exit was notable. She was one of few women of color to lead a Fortune 500 company. The retail sector, usually a reliable source of big-business female CEOs, has lost several leaders. Kohl's former chief executive Michelle Gass, for instance, left that role to become Levi Strauss's president.The CEO turnover reflects the industry's on-going trouble; in fact, earlier this year, half of all Fortune 500 companies without a permanent CEO were retailers. Gap Inc. was one of them. Now at the helm, Dickson has a major challenge in front of him. The Gap and Banana Republic brands continue to struggle, as my colleague Phil Wahba writes for Fortune. The Gap brand's 2022 sales were $3.7 billion—down 40% from a decade ago. Blakeslee faces an uphill battle too. Athleta was a bright spot for the company, but has encountered some of the same challenges as other brands that compete in the athleisure space.Story continuesThe Gap CEO vacancies were certainly a missed opportunity to bring more female leaders into the Fortune 500 universe, but had that happened, we might say they faced a glass cliff. That language doesn't apply here, but the stakes are still high. Dickson and Blakeslee will be tasked with shepherding two female-focused brands through retail's rough waters, a feat—to their credit—they both seem to have achieved in the past.The new hires also underscore just how rare it is to see a company appoint two female CEOs in a row—Xerox, Avon Products, and Reynolds American remain some of the few examples—and the ongoing need to build a strong pipeline of diverse talent behind the women who make it to the C-suite.Emma Hinchliffeemma.hinchliffe@fortune.com@_emmahinchliffeThe Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

363,88272561-d990-374b-987e-fc9c48135986,CSCO,2023-07-29,Cisco: 4 Ways To Break Up With Single-Use Plastic This July,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-4-ways-break-single-141500477.html,1690553700,STORY,['CSCO'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / July 28, 2023 / Cisco Systems Inc.Did you know July kickstarts a month-long global challenge to remove plastic from your daily routine?As an Energy and Sustainability Manager for Cisco's Workplace Resources (WPR) group, I am passionate about waste reduction, especially the reduction of single-use plastics.Why focus on plastic? Half of all plastic produced is designed for single-use purposes - used just once and then thrown away. On top of that, it is made from petroleum, a type of fossil fuel that contributes to global warming.According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, ""An estimated 11 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the ocean every year. Without immediate and sustained action, that amount will nearly triple by 2040, to 29 million metric tons per year. That's the same as dumping 110 pounds (50 kilograms) of plastic on every meter of coastline around the world.""Plastic Free July® is a key initiative of the Plastic Free Foundation that envisions a world free of plastic waste. The Plastic Free Foundation 2022 Impact Report shows that last year's Plastic Free July had a record 140 million participants making conscious changes that reduced plastic waste by 2.6 million tonnes - that's the equivalent of around 13 thousand blue whales.Want to join the movement in breaking up with single-use plastic? Here are four suggestions inspired from the Plastic Free Foundation on how you can get started, and some advice from Cisco Green Team Network members, which is an Inclusive Community for Cisco employees who are interested in sustainability:1. When eating out: Refuse plastic straws and plastic cutlery, bring reusable alternatives instead.It's easy when you're eating out to just accept a straw or fork made from plastic, but it is only used for a few minutes and then discarded. According to the Natural Resource Defense Council (NRDC), most plastics end up in landfills or in the environment, ""Single-use plastics in particular-especially small items like straws, bags, and cutlery-are traditionally hard to recycle because they fall into the crevices of recycling machinery and therefore are often not accepted by recycling centers. Left alone, plastics don't really break down; they just break up. Over time, sun and heat slowly turn plastics into smaller and smaller pieces until they eventually become what are known as microplastics.""Story continues""I'm inspired to reduce plastic waste not only because it is the right thing to do but it is now part of my everyday life,"" says Green Team member Thea Zaralidou from Greece. ""I'm motivated by my two young sons. We have taught them the importance of recycling, reusing and how this can affect the community around them. In primary school, they have learned about the dangers of plastics to the wildlife and the beaches here in Greece.""Although plastic straws and plastic cutlery are a small part of a bigger problem, it's a good place to start eliminating single-use plastic from your life. Request that your drink be served without a single-use plastic straw or use a paper straw if one is available. For those with accessibility issues or for those who would still like a straw, try reusable options made from materials like stainless steel or glass. There are even foldable versions that you can easily bring with you next time you go out. When it comes to plastic cutlery, there are portable options for those as well, usually made from stainless steel or bamboo. If you're ordering takeout, be sure to let the restaurant know you don't want them to include single use plastic cutlery with your order.2. While you're shopping: Use your own reusable shopping bags and avoid plastic packaging when buying items at the grocery store.Like other single-use plastic products, plastic bags and packaging do not biodegrade and are unlikely to be recycled. According to the New York Times, ""The bigger problem arises when people don't dispose of their bags properly, and the plastic ends up fluttering around in the wild, clogging up waterways and threatening wildlife.""Reusable shopping bags are colorful and convenient; just store them in a place you won't forget, like by the front door or in your car. Choose bags made from natural or recycled fibers such as ethically produced cotton or recycled plastic bottles. Want to make a bigger impact with a smaller footprint? You can make your own reusable shopping bags from an old piece of clothing.According to a 2020 review, the bulk of plastic waste that is polluting the environment is due to food packaging plastics. When you're shopping for groceries, try to avoid pre-packaged, single-use plastic. Opt to buy loose or bulk fruits and veggies instead, and bonus points if you bag them with lightweight, reusable produce bags. Most bags can be thrown directly into your washing machine when they need a clean. You can take this one step further with deli and baked goods by bringing your own reusable container.Green Team member Cristobal Sayrols Estrada, from Mexico City, practices sustainable shopping. ""I have adopted daily habits to minimize my use of single-use plastics. I prioritize purchasing products from locally sourced grocery stores or markets and consciously avoid plastic film and containers,"" Cristobal says. ""When I go grocery shopping, I bring my own reusable bags and containers to reduce waste. By implementing these practices, I hope to contribute to the reduction of plastic waste and protect our environment.""3. When you're on the go: Bring a reusable coffee mug and use a reusable water bottle.According to a 2023 report from the UN, ""…the world currently generates around 600 billion plastic bottles amounting to approximately 25 million tonnes of plastic waste, which is not recycled but is disposed of in landfills or as unregulated waste.""With hybrid work, it can be easy to pick up your favorite drink on your way into the office, served in a single use plastic container.While more people are using reusable water bottles these days, many people forget to bring a reusable container when they go to a coffee shop.Paper coffee cups, despite the name, have a plastic lining that keeps the liquid from dissolving the cup, and are often capped with a plastic lid.Many shops are happy to fill-up your personal container, some will even give you a discount for bringing it in. Or if you plan to hang out and work for a while, request a ceramic cup or mug.Green team members Sharon Hatego from Kenya and Diana Mehnen from Germany bring reusables on the go. Sharon says, ""I always carry my water bottle so I don't have to buy bottled water. Even my kids know this - it's right up there with bathroom check before we leave the house."" And Diana carries her own travel cup for plane travel and refill options - see photo above.4. While at home: Avoid using home goods products packaged in single-use plastic.According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, your average bottle of household cleaner is 90% water. Stop paying for water and explore concentrated or refill cleaners to reduce household plastic waste.Many cleaning products, from window cleaners to clothing detergent, come in single-use plastic containers. Bulk food stores can be a great place to look for alternatives. Many stores allow you to bring in a personal container (or get one at the store) and refill your soap, detergent, and shampoo (to name just a few options). Once you have tried this, explore other packaging-free items available in-store.Another option to explore is concentrated cleaning products. Try powdered laundry detergent or soap concentrates. Many of these products work just like their traditional counterparts when they are introduced to water. While you may not completely eliminate plastic with these options, you will greatly reduce the emissions, and therefore fossil fuels, required for production and transportation of your household cleaners.Green Team member Karen Bruntz from the United States reduces plastic in her beauty products as well. ""I use shampoo and conditioner bars and only bar soap to avoid plastic bottles,"" she says.Ready to break-up with single use plastic?
