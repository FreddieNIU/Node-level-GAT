It has amassed assets over $9.78 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueCompanies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.Value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. They also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners.CostsCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.48%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 16.20% of the portfolio. Industrials and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (BRKB) accounts for about 3.12% of total assets, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ).The top 10 holdings account for about 18.5% of total assets under management.Story continuesPerformance and RiskSCHV seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Value Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Value Total Stock Market Index is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index containing the large-cap value portion of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index.The ETF has added roughly 2.58% so far this year and is down about -0.37% in the last one year (as of 08/21/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $58.51 and $69.39.The ETF has a beta of 0.94 and standard deviation of 16.02% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 519 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. Large-Cap Value ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, SCHV is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $50.02 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $100.53 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LineAn increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2,53a82afc-9f30-389c-8f45-cdf51bf30cff,TXN,2023-08-21,7 Blue-Chip Stocks Smart Investors Should Be Loading Up on Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-blue-chip-stocks-smart-202503544.html,1692044703,STORY,"['AMT', 'ABBV', 'TEF', 'TXN', 'MDT', 'SLB']","[There’s a reasonable argument to be made that investors should load up on blue-chip stocks regularly. After all, large and well-established firms with long track records of success are likely to continue to be successful. Growth in blue-chip companies may be lower than it is in the tech sector but safety and lower volatility arguably tip the balance in favor of blue chips. That notion holds as true now as it ever has. Whether it’s your first time investing or you adhere to a strategy like dollar cost averaging, now is a great time to pick up one or more blue-chip stocks. American Tower REIT (AMT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the American Tower (AMT) website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAmerican Tower REIT (NYSE:AMT) is a stock that will provide investors with a few important things. One, it will provide income through a dividend. As a real estate investment trust (REIT), AMT is legally obligated to distribute 90% of taxable earnings to shareholders. Two, American Tower REIT is a relatively safe way to invest in the growth of 5G as a specialty REIT in the communications tower leasing space. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOn a per-share basis, American Tower’s distributions increased by 9.8% in Q2 year-over-year. Yet AMT stock has fallen throughout 2023 as net income has decreased. Net income has been negatively affected by unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Remunerations to the U.S. headquarters are more expensive, decreasing income overall. The majority of American Tower’s revenue is internationally derived. That means AMT will benefit from a weakening dollar overall. American Tower REIT is a strong choice in blue-chip stocks for the fact that revenues have grown quickly over the past 3 years combined with its 5G exposure Schlumberger (SLB) slb stockSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.comSchlumberger (NYSE:SLB) stock recently fell following second-quarter earnings that disappointed on a muted domestic drilling outlook. An increasingly positive outlook for international and offshore drilling was not sufficient to prevent the decline. Drilling productivity numbers can be found here for U.S. domestic markets. Story continuesSchlumberger provides services to firms that engage in drilling so it clearly hopes that drilling volumes will increase both domestically, internationally and offshore. However, I’d argue that the reaction was overblown even if SLB shares have basically been flat. Revenues and earnings were pretty much right where Wall Street expected. Revenues increased by 20% and EPS jumped by 44% year-over-year. There’s another reason to believe in Schlumberger outside of its strong quarterly growth figures. Schlumberger derives more than 75% of its sales from international markets. Remember, the international outlook is strong. That should give investors reason to be optimistic at this point because share prices have remained flat but its greatest revenue producer is expected to be strong. AbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comMost investors know that AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) stock is facing a rough patch as Humira continues to fall off after its reign as a blockbuster drug. If the company and stock are to remain at the top, it will be because of other drugs picking up the slack. There’s evidence that that is exactly what’s happening. Humira is the leading drug within AbbVie’s immunology portfolio and its leading revenue producer overall. Luckily, as Humira comes off patent and sales slump other immunology products are ramping up. Humira sales fell by 25% year-over-year. However, Rinvoq and Skyrizi are filling the void. Both drugs’ sales increased by more than 50% in Q2. Revenues were roughly $400 million ahead of analysts’ expectations. That’s excellent news for the company since the beat was driven by non-Humira sales. It’s exactly what investors should be hoping for from AbbVie. It paves the way forward for the firm to transition into new revenue streams perhaps quicker than expected. That softens the blow of a declining Humira. Don’t forget, ABBV includes a nice dividend, making it an ideal option in blue-chip stocks. Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comColgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) has done what a lot of consumer goods firms have done in 2023. It’s raised prices while volumes have slipped. Fortunately, it has worked and resulted in increasing sales. For example, sales volumes fell by 1.5% in the second quarter but net sales increased by 7.5%. CPG firms have clearly been able to grow by charging more for their products. Inflation numbers show that to be the case. And shoppers are fully aware of it as well. Yet, it hasn’t negatively affected firms across the sector for the most part. Investors haven’t punished CPG firms. That could be changing soon. Investors are growing tired of the higher prices and lower volumes equation as inflation subsides. Colgate-Palmolive hasn’t stated that it anticipates volume growth even as Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) did. That’s the gamble: If Colgate-Palmolive can push sales volumes up this quarter it’ll grow quickly. The company does expect overall sales to grow by as much as 8% this year though. Texas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) stock has been quite volatile in 2023 even though its beta of 1 indicates it moves in step with the broader market. The reason that matters is that it opens a possibility to play the shares in the short term. TXN shares have shown distinct peaks and valleys this year moving from $160 to $180 and back to $160 again. It is again moving toward $160 after sales contracted in Q2 and the firm gave a Q3 revenue forecast just below the midpoint. The midpoint of $4.59 billion is slightly higher than the $4.55 billion midpoint Texas Instruments gave. However, it ranges as high as $4.74 billion so the company has the potential to surprise positively.  That’s a gamble worth taking given that Texas Instruments is a relatively stable firm in a semiconductor industry that is known to be anything but. Further, Texas Instruments pays an additional 3% through dividends. Telefonica (TEF) The logo for Telefonica SA displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.comTelefonica (NYSE:TEF) is a Spanish telecommunications firm that provides voice, data and internet. It’s also a penny stock that trades for under $4 and includes a nice dividend. Let’s start there because the upside inherent in the firm is its most attractive factor. There’s roughly 33% upside in TEF shares for investors who are willing to hold the shares for a year. It trades for less than $4 but including dividends and price predictions, it is reasonable to expect that shares could provide $5.29 of value in a year’s time. Telefonica also offers value in that its price-to-earnings ratio is better than 61% of industry-wide competitors. Telefonica’s revenues grew by 4.1% and 3.3% in the first half and A2, respectively. The firm increased guidance for organic revenue growth from low single digits to 4% when it released earnings. That’s generally a good sign overall that the company can reach its goals moving forward and increase share prices.  Medtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comI like Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) stock because it’s safe and provides income to investors. The medical device firm hasn’t traded as low as it does currently since the pandemic erupted. It’s quite cheap. However, it has also been very reliable for investors over the last decade. MDT shares returned 7.27% during that period on an annualized basis. That’s well ahead of the average stock during the same period. Additionally, that figure excludes Medtronic’s dividend which pays above 3% and has not been reduced since 1978. Medtronic is also a low-beta stock that tends to preserve investor capital well. There’s good reason to believe that Medtronic will continue to grow in 2023 and well beyond. The company has more than 210 active clinical trials underway and has invested $2.7 billion in R&amp;D this year. Overall, MDT shares are simply a reasonable investment, especially for investors looking to add healthcare blue-chip stocks to their portfolios. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This will take the annual payment to 4.1% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. Check out our latest analysis for State Street State Street's Dividend Forecasted To Be Well Covered By EarningsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained.Having distributed dividends for at least 10 years, State Street has a long history of paying out a part of its earnings to shareholders. Based on State Street's last earnings report, the payout ratio is at a decent 34%, meaning that the company is able to pay out its dividend with a bit of room to spare.Looking forward, EPS is forecast to rise by 9.7% over the next 3 years. Analysts estimate the future payout ratio will be 36% over the same time period, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendState Street Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.96, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.76. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 11% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.We Could See State Street's Dividend GrowingSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that State Street has grown earnings per share at 6.0% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.State Street Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for State Street that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

4,b6463147-58ae-3791-abfa-355f2494676e,USB,2023-08-21,The 3 Most Undervalued Bank Stocks to Buy Now: August 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-most-undervalued-bank-stocks-232233495.html,1692055353,STORY,"['TFC', 'USB', 'MTB']","[If you’re a value investor looking for great businesses with cheap valuations, look no further than the banking sector in the United States. In early spring, the sector had been hit hard by a wave of awe-inducing bank failures. In particular, the sequential collapses of Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank triggered a panic among depositors and regulators. They then scrambled to prevent a systemic contagion. The crisis was, in part, facilitated by the U.S. Federal Reserve hiking interest rates as quickly as it did, which devalued the treasury bonds-holdings held on the balance sheets of many banks. However, a lack of proper risk management at the related institutions also played a significant role, making some bank stocks look lucrative.Ultimately, the crisis also exposed the wider vulnerability of banks that had invested heavily in long-term treasury bonds, which lost value as interest rates rose sharply in response to inflationary pressures. To make matters worse, Moody’s, one of the leading credit rating agencies, recently downgraded the credit ratings of a swath of small and mid-sized U.S. banks, citing a substantial amount of unrealized loan losses not being captured by regulatory capital ratios.However, not all banks are created equal, and some have managed to weather the storm better than others. In fact, some bank stockss may offer attractive opportunities for investors who are looking for undervalued and resilient stocks that can benefit from the economic recovery and the normalization of interest rates. Here are three bank stocks that fit the bill.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTruist Financial Corporation (TFC)Smartphone with website of American financial company Truist Financial Corporation on screen in front of logo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comFormed by the merger of BB&amp;T and SunTrust in December 2019, Truist (NYSE:TFC) has transformed into a regional powerhouse with a strong presence in the southeast and mid-Atlantic states. The regional bank is the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets. It has approximately $555 billion of assets on balance sheet as of August and features a diversified business model, offering a range of services such as retail and commercial banking, wealth management, insurance, mortgage and capital markets.Story continuesTruist has delivered uneven financial performance in 2023, despite the challenging environment. In the second quarter, the bank reported a net income of $1.3 billion. Though technically a year-over-year decline from last year, these metrics make sense in the current high interest rate environment which has made lending riskier for many banks, increasing loan loss provisions. These provisions offer a glimpse at how a bank expects its loan portfolio and revenue stream to perform as borrowers struggle to make monthly payments. It also has a negative effect on a bank’s profitability.On the bright side, the bank’s insurance business, a consistent bright spot, posted a record $935 million in revenue, which was up more than 13% YoY. Additionally, Truist has also maintained a strong capital position, with a common equity tier 1 ratio (CET1) of 9.6%, well above the regulatory minimum of 4.5%. This ratio measures the amount of liquid assets on balance sheet versus total risk-adjusted assets.In terms of share performance, Truist’s shares have largely underperformed the broader market in 2023, falling more than 26% year-to-date, compared to a 16% gain for the Standards and Practices (S&amp;P) 500 index. However, the stock trades relatively cheaply at 9.2 times forward earnings and offers a generous dividend yield of 6.6%. These financial characteristics along with the bank’s regional prowess should get investors interested.U.S. Bancorp (USB)The logo for U.S. Bancorp's U.S. Bank is displayed on the side of a building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comU.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, with $680 billion as of the second quarter. The bank operates in 25 states across the midwest and western regions, serving more than 18 million customers through its network of more than 2,700 branches and 4,400 ATMs. U.S. Bancorp also offers a wide range of products and services, including consumer and business banking, wealth management, payment services and corporate and investment banking.U.S. Bancorp has been one of the most consistent performers among U.S. banks, delivering superior profitability and efficiency ratios throughout the years. In the second quarter of 2023, the bank reported a net income of $1.5 billion. Similar to Truist, Bancorp suffered from higher provisions for credit losses. However, despite this setback, Bancorp maintained a robust capital position, increasing its CET1 ratio by 60 basis points to 9.1%. While U.S. Bancorp’s shares are down 9.5% year-to-date, the stock remains undervalued. U.S. Bancorp is trading at around 9.3 times forward earnings. The bank also offers an attractive dividend yield of 4.87%.M&amp;T Bank Corporation (MTB)a person putting a coin into a piggy bankSource: ShutterstockM&amp;T Bank (NYSE:MTB) happens to be the smallest bank on this list. America’s 19th-largest bank by assets operates in 12 states and offers a variety of products and services, including retail and commercial banking, wealth management, mortgage and commercial lending. Out of the group on the list, M&amp;T Bank delivered the strongest financial performance. In the second quarter in particular, the bank reported a net income of $867 million, up 299% year-over-year. If we exclude the bank’s $225 million sale of its “Collective Investment Trust business,” earnings were only up 20% from last year, but this is by no means a modest gain either. This strong net income growth was driven by both higher interest rates and demand for loans. M&amp;T Bank also maintained a solid CET1 ratio at 10.59%.Shares of M&amp;T Bank have fallen more than 6% year-to-date, but strong revenue and earnings figures compared to others small-to-midsized banks could see shares end on a more positive note this year. M&amp;T’s cheap valuation also drives its attractiveness: shares are trading at 9.4x forward earnings. This is one of the most undervalued bank stocks on the market.

Neither letter named the companies allegedly involved.International trade of goods made by convicts is illegal in the U.S. and in Cambodia, which has received preferential U.S. trade terms on billions of dollars of products over recent years. The International Labour Organization (ILO), of which Cambodia is a member, permits prison labour provided it is not forced.Cambodian Ministry of Commerce Secretary of State Sok Sopheak, who chaired an inter-ministerial committee investigating AAFA's allegations, told Reuters that Cambodia had fined three local companies $50,000 each and suspended their export licenses for three months through July 31 for using CC2 inmates to sew hotel slippers for export to the European Union and Japan. The value of the slippers exported last year was about $190,000, he said.The companies, which Sopheak confirmed were W Dexing Garment (Cambodia), IGTM (Cambodia) and Chia Ho (Cambodia) Garment Industrial, did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters could not determine which hotels ordered the slippers.The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said it had visited CC2 and raised concerns with authorities about forced labour. It said it learned in February that Cambodia was investigating and that the prison workshops had been suspended.Story continuesAAFA's first letter was copied to Pan Sorasak, Cambodia's commerce minister, and Ken Loo, secretary-general of the Textile, Apparel, Footwear and Travel Goods Association in Cambodia. AAFA's second letter added Aun Pornmoniroth, Cambodia's economy and finance minister, who is also a deputy prime minister. None of the government officials addressed in AAFA's correspondence responded to questions from Reuters. Loo said his trade group ""constantly"" reminds members to comply with local law and international labour standards.Four people familiar with the matter, including two former CC2 inmates, said other items produced in the prison appeared to be linked to Walmart and Centric Brands, the licensing partner for IZOD and other labels including Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Under Armour. Both Walmart and Centric source goods from Cambodia.The people showed Reuters a reusable Walmart-branded shopping bag and a polo shirt with IZOD branding which they said were made in the prison factories where the inmates had worked and which they said they brought out with them upon their release, the most recent in January. Reuters is not disclosing their identities, nor those of two other inmates interviewed for this report, due to concerns about their safety.Information printed on the items' tags – names of importers, style numbers and shipment codes, and codes issued by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission – indicated they were destined for the U.S. and Canada, trade records from data providers Panjiva and ImportGenius show. The records do not disclose the factory of origin, supply-chain movements or subcontracting relationships within Cambodia, and Reuters could not independently establish whether the items were made in the prison.The U.S. companies, along with Walmart importer Travelway Group International, said they were investigating their supply chains in response to Reuters' queries.""We find the allegations very concerning,"" a Walmart spokesperson said in early June. ""Forced labor of any kind is abhorrent, and we believe all people should be treated with dignity and not be exploited."" The spokesperson said the investigation was ongoing as of mid-August.Centric told Reuters in an email in June that it had ""placed on hold"" imports from a factory in Cambodia and would ""immediately terminate"" any supplier found to be using prison labour. It said in early August that it ""has not found any evidence supporting the claim that prison labor was used"" to make the polo shirt in question but had ""terminated"" its relationship with the factory, which it would not identify.The supplier was audited by Better Factories Cambodia (BFC) and Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP) for each of the past four years, and by amfori's Business Social Compliance Initiative since 2022, and there was no indication of issues related to prison labour, Centric said.""Without having the polo in-hand for closer inspection, it is impossible to definitively confirm its authenticity, including whether it is counterfeit or unauthorized,"" Centric said.Authentic Brands Group, which owns the IZOD brand, and BFC said they took forced-labour allegations seriously.Once a year BFC conducts unannounced, two-day assessments of all Cambodian factories that produce garments and travel goods for export, said the ILO, which helps run the monitoring initiative.When asked about the IZOD-branded polo shirt and shown photographs, the ILO said tracing a garment to a particular factory and assessing working conditions in prisons were not within the initiative's mandate.A spokesperson for amfori said members were responsible for monitoring their suppliers and subcontractors, but that to the best of his knowledge amfori had not encountered cases of forced or prison labour in Cambodia and had not found a connection between its members' businesses and CC2.WRAP also said it was investigating the case.The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative did not answer questions from Reuters about potential repercussions of such labour at CC2.$1.75 to $5 Per monthReuters pieced together details of garment manufacturing in CC2 through interviews with four women released as recently as January after completing drug sentences of up to two years. Reuters verified the women served time in CC2 through prison and court records.The former inmates said they worked standard hours and made shirts, trousers, hotel slippers and shopping bags. Refusing to work often meant being moved to a different cell or forced to kneel, though some prisoners avoided the factories by paying prison guards, they said.""We didn't want to work but we had to work. When we were in the prison we were equal to zero,"" said one former inmate.Cambodia sets a minimum $200 monthly wage for garment workers, but the women said they usually received about $1.75 to $5 per month.All the former inmates said they used their factory earnings to pay for their cells to be cleaned, for electricity, fans, water, laundry soap, sanitary pads, or additional food.Three women said they did not have employment contracts, and that guards simply took their names before they began working in the prison factories.Cambodia's Ministry of Interior, the General Department of Prisons and the official in charge of CC2 at the time, Klot Dara, did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters could not determine who owned the factories or details of their arrangement with the prison.An ILO spokesperson said that if a prisoner declines to work, the government must ensure they do not face threats or penalties.""A good indication of whether prisoners freely consent to work is whether the conditions of employment approximate those of a free labour relationship,"" the spokesperson said.Cambodia investigates Prison labour at CC2 potentially puts Cambodia at odds with the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences, which grants duty-free benefits to eligible developing nations. The program has lapsed and is awaiting U.S. lawmakers' reauthorisation.While the program excludes textiles, eligibility for its benefits – through which Cambodia sold $2 billion worth of goods to the U.S. in 2020 – in part depends on the beneficiary country prohibiting forced labour.Cambodian commerce ministry officials met with other government, prison and trade association representatives in February and March to discuss AAFA's concerns about whether international norms for producing export goods were being followed in Cambodia, the ministry said on its official Facebook account.On March 17, Sopheak told AAFA president and CEO Stephen Lamar and senior vice president of policy Nate Herman, the U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's U.S. ambassador, and others, that Cambodia would clarify the law to distinguish between prison production for rehabilitation programs and commercial subcontracting, the commerce ministry posted on Facebook the next day.Cambodia held an election in July. In mid-August, Sopheak told Reuters progress on legal clarification would need to wait for the new government to be officially announced, and would depend on its priorities.(Reporting by Clare Baldwin in Phnom Penh and Katherine Masters in New York.

If you want to skip out on our introduction to the famous hedge fund investor and the latest news about him, then head on over to Michael Burry's Top 5 Stock Picks For Q3. Few hedge fund owners have had movies made about them, and perhaps even fewer have predicted the Great Recession of 2008. Michael Burry, the hedge fund boss who ran Scion Capital back in 2008, has seen both, and he currently runs the private investment firm Scion Capital Group, LLC.Dr. Burry is one of the rare hedge fund investors in the industry who is not a Ph.D. doctor. Instead, he is a Doctor of Medicine, through a degree that he earned from the University of California, Los Angeles. He is also another rare hedge fund boss who is still licensed to practice medicine, as he regularly keeps up with the educational requirements needed to maintain the ability to practice medicine in the United States.In case you're unaware, Dr. Burry rose to prominence in the financial world when he correctly predicted that the real estate market in America would crash by 2007. His hypothesis was based on the fact that subprime mortgages, which are loans made to borrowers with low FICO scores, would rapidly drop in value once their teaser rates were replaced by higher rates. Since these loans formed the basis of financial assets such as mortgage backed securities, the broader implications of the subprime borrowers being unable to make their loan payments in the finance industry would be severe. Subsequently, Dr. Burry shorted the subprime market and proved his detractors wrong when he netted nearly a billion dollars in profit during a time when wealthy and regular Americans witnessed large wipeouts in their assets.However, since then, several of his predictions have proven to be wrong. One of Dr. Burry's most famous short positions has been against the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). He posted on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) in December 2020 that he was short on Tesla and advised the firm's chief Mr. Elon Musk that he should take advantage of the high share price back then to raise capital by issuing more shares. Adjusting for all stock splits to date, Tesla's shares were worth $235 as 2020 ended (they were trading above $550 before the splits when Burry made the bearish remarks), and since then, they gained nearly 81% in value to touch $407 in just 11 months. Currently, Tesla is trading around $225, having lost only $10 since Dr. Burry revealed his position.Story continuesGoing against Tesla isn't the only thing that Dr. Burry's been up to since the housing market crash before the Great Recession. One of his latest predictions came in January when he outlined on X:Inflation peaked. But it is not the last peak of this cycle. We are likely to see CPI lower, possibly negative in 2H 2023, and the US in recession by any definition.Fed will cut and government will stimulate. And we will have another inflation spike. It's not hard.Since then, the U.S. economy has grown during the second quarter, inflation has consistently fallen, and the Federal Reserve continues to hike interest rates. In fact, the Fed's potential decisions have created some unease among investors, who are uncertain whether robust economic data provides the central bank with more leeway to increase interest rates. At the same time, banks such as Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have either reduced their odds of a recession or scrapped the forecasts completely.With the second quarter hedge fund filing season upon us, Dr. Burry's private investment firm Scion Asset Management also filed its 13-F report with the SEC. This report created ripples in the market and the media as it revealed two massive bearish bets against the stock market. These are the largest bets in his portfolio, and cumulatively, they represent nearly 94% of Michael Burry's latest holdings. In investing, there are derivatives that are called options. They are of two kinds, namely a Put and a Call. Among these, a Put option is a bearish bet since it provides an investor with the opportunity to sell the shares at a predetermined price called the strike price. So, if the underlying security is trading at a price lower than the strike price, the investor profits by buying the security at the lower price and then selling it at a higher price.Dr. Burry's investment portfolio shows that he has bought a stunning $1.6 billion worth of Put options. One of these is for an index fund that tracks the NASDAQ 100 and and the other is for the S&amp;P 500. Seems like the Big Short investor is really going all in when it comes to betting against the market, and only time can tell whether he succeeds or not.While we wait to see how Michael Burry's bet against the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ 100 plays out, here's a list of his top stock picks during this year's second quarter. Some notable names are Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR), Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC), and Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE).Michael Burry's Top 10 Stock Picks For Q3Michael Burry of Scion Asset ManagementOur Methodology To make our list of Michael Burry's top stock picks for the third quarter, we took a look at his latest investments during the second quarter.

""It's doubtful they're going to be buying. They bought a lot of crude for storage earlier in the year. They're sitting on a lot of crude.""Brent crude settled down 34 cents at $84.46, a loss of 0.4%. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude finished at $80.72 a barrel for a loss of 53 cents or 0.65%. Earlier in the session, both benchmarks had been up by as much as $1.""Right now, its a battle between Saudi production cuts versus demand destruction,"" said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures, Mizuho Securities USA.Gains in crude prices through the summer were driven by the tight balance between crude oil supply and high demand, especially in the U.S. summer driving season, which ends the first of September, and from Latin America.At the same time, OPEC led by Saudi Arabia, plus Russia have cut production to better match demand, especially from China, which has yet to meet expectations for post-pandemic recovery.Saudi Arabia said this month its production would remain around 9 million barrels per day, a cut of about 1 million barrels, through the month of September.Last week, both front-month benchmark fell 2%, snapping a seven-week winning streak on concerns China's sluggish economic growth will curb oil demand, while the possibility of further increases to U.S. interest rates also overshadows the demand outlook.China's central bank trimmed its one-year lending rate by 10 basis points and left its five-year rate unmoved. That was a surprise to analysts who had expected cuts of 15 bps to both as recovery in the world's second-largest economy has been slowed by a worsening property slump, weak spending and tumbling credit growth.Top exporter Saudi Arabia's July shipments to China fell 31% from June while Russia, with its discounted crude, remained the Asian giant's largest supplier, Chinese customs data showed.Story continuesChina's crude oil imports from Saudi Arabia are expected to remain depressed through the third quarter, analysts said.China is drawing on record inventories amassed earlier this year as refiners scale back purchases after prices were driven above $80 a barrel by supply cuts implemented by the OPEC+ group comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia.""We still see a tight oil balance for the remainder of the year, which suggests that prices still have some room to run higher,"" said Warren Patterson, ING's head of commodities research, adding that the dollar was also providing support.A weaker dollar makes oil purchases less expensive for holders of other currencies, potentially boosting demand.(Reporting by Erwin Seba in Houston, Natalie Grover and Paul Carsten in London, Florence Tan in Singapore and Mohi Narayan in New Delhi; Editing by David Goodman, Mark Potter, Barbara Lewis, Nick Macfie and David Gregorio)]"

For now though, traders on the money market see a 89% chance of the Fed holding rates at current levels at its September meeting, according to Investing.com's fed rate monitor tool.WTI for the most active October contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled down 54 cents, or 0.7%, at $80.12 per barrel. WTI hit a session high of $81.74 earlier. The U.S. crude benchmark finished last week down 2.3% after a near 20% gain over seven previous weeks.Story continuesBrent settled down 34 cents, or 0.4%, at $84.46 per barrel. It earlier hit a session high of $85.83. The global crude benchmark lost around 3% last week after a seven-week rally that gave oil bulls an 18% return.Some analysts said crude was expected to stay volatile through the week and possibly end lower on weaker technicals, combined with the “China-bear” story and expectations for a hawkish Fed at Jackson Hole.China's renewed economic weakness has raised questions over whether its oil demand can remain resilient.Evergrande, one of China’s biggest names in real estate, filed Thursday for Chapter 15 bankruptcy, which is a way for foreign companies to use US bankruptcy law to restructure debt. The process will take time, as Evergrande has roughly $19 billion in offshore debt.The filing serves as a cautionary tale about the growth-at-all-costs model that underpinned China’s spectacular growth over the past 30 years. For decades, Evergrande — pronounced “ever grand,” with a silent final “e” — gobbled up debt as China’s economy exploded. Demand for housing was so strong, homebuilders often pre-sold apartment units to buyers before construction was complete.But a sudden shift in policy by China’s leaders two years ago has left the country’s property developers scrambling for cash, compounding financial risks within the world’s second-largest economy.Evergrande’s crisis raises questions on which would be the next shoe to drop on the Chinese economy. And that appears to be Country Garden, another major name in realty which employs some 300,000 people. The firm has already missed two payments on its multibillion-dollar debt and said it was considering “various debt management measures.July was a particularly woeful month for China, with one bad patch of economic data after another, from bank loans at a 14-year low and exports sliding their most since February 2020. The yuan also tumbled against the dollar, adding to the weight on commodities, particularly oil.The People’s Bank of China cut its one-year loan prime rate by 10 basis points to 3.45% earlier Monday. While this was less than had been expected, and the five-year rate which is used to determine mortgage costs was left unchanged, this still suggests that Beijing is determined to support the second largest economy in the world as it struggles with a slowing post-COVID economic recovery. The Chinese central bank unexpectedly cut short and medium-term lending rates last week.""It seems that (China's recovery) is not going to happen,"" John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, said. ""It's doubtful they're going to be buying. They bought a lot of crude for storage earlier in the year.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield will be 2.1%, which is fairly typical for the industry. View our latest analysis for Flowserve Flowserve's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Prior to this announcement, Flowserve's dividend was only 44% of earnings, however it was paying out 2,295% of free cash flows. This signals that the company is more focused on returning cash flow to shareholders, but it could mean that the dividend is exposed to cuts in the future.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 54.9%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 30% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendFlowserve Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.48 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.2% a year over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Flowserve has impressed us by growing EPS at 12% per year over the past five years. While on an earnings basis, this company looks appealing as an income stock, the cash payout ratio still makes us cautious.Our Thoughts On Flowserve's DividendOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

That's kind of our claim to fame. That's the product we invented.""But that's not all his company does.""And they're very surprised to learn that the same company does so much more. We're helping protect health-care products, such as vaccines and pharmaceuticals, that have to be kept safe through transport so they're effective in their final use. And we're also helping protect foods.""Foods like chicken, meat and produce.""We create flexible packaging that's used in protecting chicken and red meat and other fresh products from the point of production to the consumer. Our packaging helps keep it fresh, keeps it from leaking and keeps the food safe for people to eat.""That packaging plays a big role in sustainability.""Flexible plastic is a very thin material, is extremely adaptable, and it has unique properties. It's lighter weight, and because of that, it reduces the carbon impact of shipping. You're able to ship the same amount of material with a lower environmental impact, because of the lightness of the overall shipment.""""The most important thing is that the plastics offer a barrier, and they play a role in protecting the freshness of the food that's transported, not just from state to state but also globally. So flexible plastic helps reduce food waste. Food waste can have huge environmental impacts. That's why it's critical to protect foods that have had a lot of energy going into producing them and making sure that they don't spoil before they get to the consumer.""Story continuesBut that's not good enough for Timi.""We're looking to make this packaging even more sustainable.""As a chemical engineer and sustainability, technology, innovation manager at SEE, he's working to further improve the sustainability benefits of flexible plastic packaging by helping his company jumpstart innovative advanced recycling technologies.These technologies take often hard-to-recycle plastics such as flexible plastics from the food supply chain and break them down into their basic building blocks to be remade into new food-grade protective packaging.New plastics that can be remade again. And again…Meet Timi. One of America's Change Makers.Timi sees advanced recycling as an effective way to help keep plastics out of landfills and our environment.""Right now, a lot of plastic film is likely discarded into a landfill. What we want to do with advanced recycling is capture these types of films such as food packaging that can't go through our traditional recycling infrastructure today. We want to use advanced recycling to recycle this essential packaging and eliminate the plastic waste but also create a product that can go right back into this packaging over and over again.""Many people are unaware that flexible plastics typically should not be put in curbside recycling bins.""Items placed in most curbside recycling bins are sent to material recovery facilities where machines sort recyclables. These machines can handle all kinds of rigid plastics such as milk jugs or water bottles but flexible plastics such as bread bags or Bubble Wrap® can get wound around the machinery and cause it to jam.""""Lots of flexible plastics can be dropped off at retailers for recycling and may end up as things such as synthetic lumber for decking. But other kinds of flexible plastics like the packaging that protects fresh meat and chicken in the grocery store can't be tossed into these store bins. Recovering these essential packaging materials requires innovative recycling solutions beyond traditional mechanical recycling.""By helping advanced recycling grow, a lot more of that flexible plastic can get recycled.""Advanced recycling is very promising and very exciting. As we establish the infrastructure for advanced recycling, it will be better able to handle the flexible packaging films. That can help eliminate plastic waste and in doing so help protect our environment, keep our streets clean, keep our forests clean, our beaches clean.""Used packaging that once was considered waste can now be remade in many cases.""Making products to be remade is what advanced recycling offers. That will reduce our need for natural resources in key materials that go into our packaging in the first place. So, we need to invest in advanced recycling, we need to establish the infrastructure, and it needs to grow and scale up globally.""Timi sees a promising trend in his generation, as well as a new generation he's helping create.""I would say my generation is very focused on sustainability. We think about the products that we buy; we think about how the products we buy are packaged. That's something that's very front of mind for our generation.""""And I've learned a lot more about sustainability since being at Sealed Air. I've been able to teach my friends and family how to recycle more appropriately.""""With my daughter, I try to instill in her how to recycle properly too as she's growing and learning. We take the flexible plastics that we collect in our household, and we drop them off at the store for recycling. That's something we do as a family.""That's a sustainable trend every generation can get behind.Meet Ron Cotterman, another Change Maker from SEE.The story of plastic is evolving.

July also marks the first year-over-year decrease in rent for studio units since 2020, continuing the downward trend led by two-bedroom units in May and one-bedroom units in June.""Renters in many areas are now spending slightly less on rent relative to their overall income, giving their budgets a little more breathing room at a time of stubborn inflation and ongoing affordability concerns,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist at Realtor.com®. ""With our midyear forecast update noting a surge in multi-family construction and an uptick in vacancy rates, we anticipate this downward pressure on rent prices will continue, providing many renters with much-needed stability in their housing expenses. Given the current rental market momentum and seasonal trends, it will be very unlikely to see a new peak rent in 2023.""July 2023 Rental Metrics by Unit Size – NationalUnit SizeMedian RentRent YoYRent Change – July 2019Overall$1,759-1.0 %24.7 %Studio$1,445-0.4 %18.0 %1-bed$1,642-0.6 %24.9 %2-bed$1,948-1.1 %26.9 % Affordability advancing slowly, supported by new supply In July 2023, nationwide rent was slightly more affordable than July of the previous year. To be considered affordable, one rule of thumb is that housing costs should fall below 30% of gross household income. In July 2023, people earning the typical household income and looking to rent would be spending 25.9% of their earnings to lease a typical for-rent home, down from 26.5% in July 2022. This positive change can be attributed to a combination of declining median rents and rising median household income. Additionally, increased supply is boosting vacancy rates and helping drive down rents. However, vacancy rates still remain below pre-pandemic levels, rent prices are elevated overall, and affordability continues to be a significant issue. Renters in eight of the top 50 metros, for example, pay a rent share higher than 30% relative to the median household income.Story continuesMiddle America remains an affordable oasis between costly coastal locations, for nowThe least affordable markets in July 2023 include coastal and Sun Belt locations, where renters often spent more than 30% of the median household income on housing costs. Miami, Fla., was by far the least affordable rental market, followed by Los Angeles, San Diego, New York City, Boston, Riverside, Calif., Tampa, Fla., and Orlando, Fla. In three of these eight cities, affordability has worsened compared with last year. In Miami, for example, renters would have spent 44.2% of their monthly paycheck on the typical rental in July 2023. Conversely, Oklahoma City was the most affordable rental market in July 2023, with renters spending 18.4% of their median household income on housing. Other affordable rental markets include midwestern mainstays such as Columbus, Ohio; Minneapolis, Minn.; Cincinnati; and Kansas City, Kan.South and West affordability improves, Midwest rents rise While rents in the South and West remain high, these areas show improved affordability, following a consistent downward rental cost trend during the preceding months. The most significant improvement was Riverside, Calif., where renters with a typical household income would spend 33.9% of their monthly paycheck on the typical rental in July 2023; while higher than the 30% affordability threshold, this represents a decline of 3.4 percentage points compared with 12 months ago. Meanwhile, strong demand in Midwest markets such as Milwaukee-Waukesha, Wis.; Birmingham, Ala.; and Indianapolis is driving lower vacancy rates and faster rent growth, eroding affordability in more traditionally budget-friendly locations.""As renters determine their next move, whether it's to stay put, save up to buy a home, or move and rent in a new location, the rental landscape is showing signs of improvement,"" said Jiayi Xu, Economist at Realtor.com®.

Realtor.com® began publishing regular monthly rental trends reports in October 2020 with data history stretching back to March 2019.With the release of its July rent report, Realtor.com® incorporated a new and improved methodology for capturing and reporting more comprehensive rental listing trends and metrics. The new methodology is expected to yield a cleaner, more representative and more consistent measurement of rental listings and trends at both the national and local level. The methodology has been adjusted to better represent the true cost of primary housing for renters. Most areas across the country will see minor changes with a smaller handful of areas seeing larger updates. As a result of these changes, the rental data released since July 2023 will not be directly comparable with previous releases and Realtor.com® economics blog posts. However, future data releases, including historical data, will consistently apply the new methodology.Rental affordability analysis: The affordable monthly rent is calculated by applying the 30% rule to the estimated 2023 monthly median household income nationwide ($6,793 across the 50 largest U.S. metros, on average) and in each metro. The monthly median household income is derived from the annual median household income data sourced from Claritas. Due to the methodology changes noted above, Realtor.com® has made historical revisions to its prior affordability analyses. For our most recently published affordability analysis on February 2023 data published in March 2023, the national rent-to-income share has been updated to 25.1%.About Realtor.com® Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

23,f0cd542c-438c-33df-b93c-c87c0a339e72,MRO,2023-08-21,Ken Fisher’s Top 15 Energy Stock Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ken-fisher-top-15-energy-181444280.html,1692555284,STORY,"['CVX', 'MRO', 'BP', 'HAL', 'XOM', 'DVN', 'HES', 'PBR-A', 'EQNR']","[In this piece, we will take a look at Ken Fisher's top 15 energy stock picks. If you want to skip our introduction to the billionaire hedge fund boss and the energy industry, then jump ahead to Ken Fisher's Top 5 Energy Stock Picks. This year has been a reality check for the energy industry, after record high profits last year in the wake of the crude oil supply chain shock due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Oil companies, large and small, had bathed in record high profits last year. Leading the pack when it comes to big oil and 2022 oil industry profits is the American giant Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) which brought in a massive $59 billion in profits and set a new record for the earnings of any Western oil company. In second, third, fourth, and fifth places are Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE), and BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP), which earned $39.9 billion, $36.5 billion, $36.2 billion, and $27.7 billion in profits, respectively. This enabled Shell to set a new profit record in its century-old history, and cumulatively, the oil giants brought in a stunning $200 billion in profits.These profits also led to handsome shareholder rewards, with the oil companies paying out a whopping $110 billion to investors in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Additionally, Europe's rapid diversification from Russian gas to other sources also led to the Norwegian state owned oil and gas company Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) doubling its operating income to $74.9 billion last year. Safe to say, 2022 was a year that neither the oil companies nor the consumer hit by record high pump prices will forget anytime in the future.Moving forward to 2023, big oil it seems is in for a reckoning. For the second quarter of 2023, Shell and TotalEnergies reported painful 56% and 49% profit drops, respectively. Despite this, Total managed to still grow profits over the second quarter of 2021 while Shell's results remained in line with the earnings during the same time period. Equinor reported an even sharper drop as its Q2 profits tanked by 57% annually, but none of these could match BP's turmoil as the British oil giant reported its profits dropping by 70%. This trend is also present in smaller American oil exploration, production, and equipment companies. In fact, when it comes to share price performance this year, nearly all of the worst performing companies this year are either those that provide production equipment to oil companies or hold interests in petroleum producing properties.

As a primer, energy stocks tend to well in a robust economic environment as stronger corporate growth and more disposable incomes naturally lead to greater demand for their products. And one easy way to sift stocks is to take a look at what the professionals are doing.One such professional, whose decades of experience in the stock market has provided him with remarkable insights into the markets, is none other than the billionaire Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments. Mr. Fisher is one of the richest people in the world, with his latest net worth estimated at a cool $6.8 billion. He is also one of the very few financial gurus out there that had correctly predicted last year that October was the start of a bull market. This was when most analysts were fearful of a recession. He continued being the wise guru that he is earlier this year when he bucked the trend of panic in the midst of a regional banking crisis and stressed that the risks of contagion remain minimal.Given the current uncertainty about the future of the stock market for the remainder of the year, Mr. Fisher is back with his wisdom. He continues to be the optimist, stressing in a recent video:So the reality is, sentiment is consistent with a continued bull market. We're not in pessimism anymore, but, we're not anywhere close to optimism. We got a ways to run. In the long term, the market is about economics and reality. And as Ben Graham famously said, ""In the short term, the market's a voting machine. In the long term, it's a weighing machine."" That long term is weighing those real things. In the short term, it's a voting machine which is more like an election and it's really about, who do you like,  what are you afraid of. It's more about your emotions and sentiment. And that sentiment part is important to focus on. It right now is in a category regardless of which subsets of it you look at in the marketplace. Newsletters, pension plans, high retail investors, money managers, it's in the skepticism phase. And with that, you should remember Warren Buffett's famous line, that you should be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful. And right now people are not overly greedy. So, you should be.Some of Ken Fisher's top energy stock picks are TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL).Ken Fisher's Top 15 Energy Stock PicksOur Methodology To compile our list of Ken Fisher's top energy stock picks, we took a look at Fisher Investments' latest filings with the SEC that list down the firm's investments during the second quarter of 2023.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the stock market performance in 2023, head directly to 5 Best Affordable Stocks Under $30. According to BlackRock, the stock market has performed better than the initial estimates for the year. Previously, investors had expressed concerns about the market performance in 2023. However, so far, the equity market has fought off banking pressures, a risk for recession, and the Federal Reserve’s restrictive monetary policy and outperformed estimations. Recently, the tech industry has been the star of the show. With AI-based innovation leading the tech industry, the market has exhibited strong returns. This was further aided by the Federal Reserve’s efforts to normalize inflation during the year. Altogether, experts see the market moving towards a ‘soft-landing’, whereby growth stabilizes and inflation is maintained close to the targeted rate. Similar to the time between 2015 and 2019, this calls for a preference for growth, with technology and consumer discretionary stocks being the star performers. All this has led to an increase in the S&amp;P 500 index gaining close to 16% and the NASDAQ Composite to increase by nearly 30% year-to-date as of August 18. However, despite the performance so far, the economy gives off mixed signals for the future. Also Read: 11 Cheap Bank Stocks To Buy Before They Take OffWhile the initial estimates for the probability of a recession this year have certainly improved, according to the Federal Reserve, their model still calculates a 71% chance for a recession by May 2024, which is the highest since 1982. Despite this, consumer spending and the performance of the labor market continues to be promising. The government’s efforts to counter the inflationary pressure is one of the leading factors for a better performance in the equity market. In 2022, the consumer price index had surged to 9.1%. Although the Federal Reserve hopes to achieve a long-term target of 2%, it was successful in bringing it as low as 3% by June this year. Story continuesIn 2022, Michael Gapen, the chief U.S. economist at Bank of America, expected unemployment and inflation rates to induce a mild recession by 2023. However, as the unemployment rate was reported at just 3.5% in July this year, Mr. Gapen had this to say about the new incoming data about the United States economy:""We revise our outlook in favor of a 'soft landing' where growth falls below trend in 2024, but remains positive throughout.""Don't Miss: 11 Cheap Gold Stocks To Buy According to AnalystsAnother major contributor for the market performance has been consumer spending. Given the increased cost of borrowing and the rates of unemployment that were expected initially, consumer spending was forecasted to tighten. During unemployment, households tend to save more. However, with the labor market performing better than estimates, consumer spending is on the rise. In fact, the consumer discretionary sector has reported the highest earnings growth in the second quarter, with the earnings per share rising by about 36% from the previous year. Although the market has exhibited resilience against the recessionary pressure, many investors still appear to have taken a rather cynical approach to the future. Brian Moynihan, the CEO for Bank of America, believes that a recession might be inevitable during the next year. Similarly, Vanguard economists reported that the market performance this year has, in essence, delayed the inevitable recession to the next year. In line with this, JPMorgan Chase expects a global slow-down by 2024. In contrast, investor sentiment seems to remain strong. Seemingly, the risk appetite appears to be rising as well, as the Russell 2000 Index, which focuses on small cap stocks, is up by roughly 7% this year. While the current market performance can be a motivator for beginner investors to consider investing in stocks, the recessionary pressures are forecasted to only strengthen. Ergo, investors looking to minimize risk by investing in affordable stocks can check our list of picks, which includes Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), Pinterest, Inc.

(NASDAQ:WBD), Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS), and AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is one of the best affordable stocks under $30. Massif Capital had this to say about The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Currently, the portfolio has roughly 11% allocated across two utilities, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) and Polaris Renewable Energy. In the case of both equities, we have experienced disappointing 2023 market results, and in the case of AES, it is the long-book’s worst performer YTD, dragging down the overall portfolio by -2.09%. Polaris contributed a positive return of 0.21%. These two positions represent investments in similar assets but very different businesses, which explains much of the divergence in this year’s results.In the case of AES, we have a heavily US-focused utility with significant exposure to regulated and unregulated markets and a significant commitment to building out renewable energy. The firm also has some exposure to electricity markets in South America and exposure to electricity storage markets in the form of its ownership stake in Fluence (FLNC). Despite being one of the larger US utilities, the firm has trailed the sector (as measured by the IXUTR Index) dramatically this year…” (Click here to read the full text)11. Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Share Price as of August 18: $27.09Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR) is an oil and natural gas exploration company in the United States.

Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is the biggest shareholder in the company, with 4.15 million shares worth $95.6 million. Carillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund made the following comment about Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR) is a natural gas exploration and production company with operations in the Appalachian Basin. Overall natural gas storage inventories recently have reached slightly elevated levels, due largely to the milder than average winter experienced across the globe. This dynamic has weighed on benchmark natural gas prices, and in turn has pressured Antero’s stock. Despite these current headwinds, we believe the company’s relatively low-cost operations, strong balance sheet, positive recent productivity trends, and ability to price its production at a premium to benchmark prices should position it well to weather the current choppy environment until the country’s liquified natural gas export capacity increases over the next several years.”10. Clarivate Plc (NYSE:CLVT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Share Price as of August 18: $7.09Clarivate Plc (NYSE:CLVT) operates as a data analytics company that offers solutions in scientific research and innovation.

Clarivate goes to market with a collection of well-known brands, including Web of Science, ProQuest One, Alma, Cortellis, Derwent, and CompuMark.Clarivate has an attractive business model. The company’s foundation is its highly valuable proprietary data assets (#1 or #2 player in most markets) that are combined with analytical tools and insights to help users apply the underlying data to everyday business problems. As an important part of the end users’ daily workflow, Clarivate’s indispensable, mission-critical solutions create a sticky and predictable business model with high levels of recurring revenue (about 80% recurring revenue and over 90% renewal rates).

(NASDAQ:ZI) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“We ended our investment campaigns in BILL Holdings, ZoomInfo Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:ZI) and First Republic Bank during the quarter. ZoomInfo is a leading provider of contact databases and associated marketing automation tools for business-to-business sellers. Our thesis was that the company’s combination of data, insights and digital tools was being well received by companies looking to increase sales force productivity and enhance the returns on their substantial customer relationship management (CRM) software investments. However, we have grown increasingly skeptical about the durability of its top-line growth in a challenging economic environment as customers potentially look to cut costs and the company is unproven in a downturn. Given these concerns, we decided to harvest the position.”8. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Share Price as of August 18: $26.39Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is an oil exploration company that operates in the United States.

An underweight to communication services and an overweight to energy helped performance, while an underweight to consumer staples and an overweight to materials detracted. Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.”7. The Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Share Price as of August 18: $23.80Next on our list of the best affordable stocks is The Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMK), which is an entertainment company that operates podcasts, music, sports, weather, traffic, and infotainment channels.

Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) delivered a modestly positive return in the second quarter, while The Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMA) rebounded sharply, likely due to its upcoming recapitalization. In August, Liberty SiriusXM will move its 30% stake in concert promotion and ticketing firm Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (LYV) to a new tracking stock (Liberty Live Group), leaving Liberty SiriusXM shares as a “pure play” tracker of its 82% ownership of satellite radio provider SiriusXM Holdings, Inc. (SIRI). We intend to own both trackers upon receipt, and we believe the clearer structure may lead investors to reduce the current, large mark-to-market discount between Liberty SiriusXM and its underlying SiriusXM shares.”6.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway held the highest stake in the company, with 29 million shares worth $783.3 million.Similar to Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS), and AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) is one of the best affordable stocks under $30. Silver Beech Capital had this to say about Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) is the largest all-digital bank in the United States, the 22nd largest bank by total assets ($192 billion), the nation’s leading prime auto lender (with 6.5 million consumer customers), and leading auto floor plan lender (with over 23,000 dealer relationships). Most of Ally’s assets are auto loans and finance receivables, but Ally also offers consumer protection insurance through its dealer channels and operates small corporate and mortgage lending businesses. Notably, Ally also offers some of the industry’s most competitive deposit products: Ally was awarded “Best Checking Account”, “Best Saving Account”, and overall “Best Online Bank” by third party reviews and was the first large bank to eliminate overdraft fees. We believe Ally’s intrinsic value is more than 40% greater than its March 31 share price.Ally evolved from the auto finance unit of GMAC, emerged from GMAC’s restructuring as a bank holding company and rebranded, before going public in 2014. Since then, Ally has transformed itself from a wholesale-funded, captive finance company into a full-service retail-funded automotive finance and insurance provider by steadily gaining retail deposit market share. Today, Ally’s balance sheet is 85% funded (versus 43% funded in 2014) by $152 billion of deposits (versus $58 billion in 2014) across 4.4 million depositors (versus 900k depositors in 2014). Over 90% of Ally’s deposits are FDIC insured, more than any other $100+ billion asset bank in the United States. Ally’s massive insured deposit base is stickier and more resilient to depositor fear of a bank run than other regional banks…”(Click here to read the full text)   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Affordable Stocks Under $30.  Suggested articles:Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks10 Korean Stocks Listed in the U.S.Bill Gates Stock Portfolio: August 2023 Update Disclosure: None. 12 Best Affordable Stocks Under $30 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

In addition, Arkifi does not hallucinate, a term for when AI models make up false information, said Chief Executive Officer Hesam Motlagh. Arkifi will also build a plug-in for the Microsoft 365 Copilot AI product.Since Microsoft-backed OpenAI launched the ChatGPT chatbot which created a sensation, global enterprises have been racing to figure out how to use generative AI to make company workflows more efficient.“It’s a classic example of what will happen in many, many industries,” said Vinod Khosla, founder of Khosla Ventures. “You take a function where there is a lot of grunt work and the AI does that work for you, so you can spend more time thinking and doing the more creative stuff.”Arkifi said its customers include large financial institutions, though it declined to identify any. On Monday, the company opened a public waitlist.Motlagh said that Arkifi can replace much of the work that junior financial analysts, typically new college graduates, perform, such as pulling public company information and formatting spreadsheets.“In the long run, this will disintermediate some human labor,” he said.

To skip our detailed analysis of generative AI and its application in the field of investing, you can go directly to see the 5 Stocks ChatGPT Said Will Make Me Rich in 10 Years.Using Artificial Intelligence To InvestThe markets have been talking about artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, all year. Companies across a wide range of industries and sectors are attempting to introduce their own AI-driven products and services so as not to be left in the dust by their competitors. At the same time, every investor is trying to get into the artificial intelligence trade today. Individual investors and hedge funds alike are putting their manpower into picking out the best AI stocks for the rest of the year as we head into the second half of 2023. Interestingly enough, at this point, it's not just manpower that's going into picking stocks. Some investors and hedge funds are actually trying to harness the power of AI to pick stocks instead of leaving the job to human beings. This trend really gets you thinking about how successful an AI software might be at helping an investor build up their portfolio. Is it a strategy that might lead to mind-blowing results or one that will lead you to ruin?On August 3, CNBC invited Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, to talk about just this. CNBC's Bob Pisani noted that AI-driven exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been around for a while and are starting to come up more this year. Pisani thus invited Rosenbluth to share some of his insights on these ETFs and how effective they are. According to Rosenbluth, a lot more AI-driven ETFs have been working on picking stocks recently. Here's what he had to say about this development:""It's perhaps a smarter way of picking stocks. I know that computers can be smarter than I know I am, [it's] whether or not they're going to be better at outperforming the broader S&amp;P 500. There's no emotion behind it.""Story continuesIs Generative AI Really Helpful For Investors?The discussion surrounding artificial intelligence, in general, and in the world of investing, has been extremely interesting because of the immense potential of this technology when it comes to changing the way people live, work, and even invest. It makes you wonder how not only AI-driven ETFs but also AI chatbots can contribute to the investing world today. This May, CNN reported that a dummy portfolio of 38 stocks recommended by OpenAI's viral chatbot, ChatGPT, actually managed to outperform major investment funds in the United Kingdom, for instance. This portfolio managed to gain about 4.9% between March 6 and April 28, while the 10 leading investment funds of the country reported an average loss of about 0.8%. During the same period, the S&amp;P 500 rose by 3%. The result of this experiment is merely one example of the sheer potential vested in artificial intelligence when it comes to investing.Our Stock-Picking Experiment with ChatGPTConsidering these developments, we also attempted to get a list of stocks from ChatGPT this March. We first prompted the AI chatbot to present itself as a professional investment advisor and then asked it to present a list of 10 stocks it thinks will make us rich in the next 10 years. ChatGPT then proceeded to give us a diversified list of stocks, ranging from tech names and consumer staples to financials and healthcare. Some of the most notable names on its list included Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), all big names in the tech and AI sectors this year.Today we will be revisiting this list of stocks to see how each of these companies has performed over the period between March and August and check if ChatGPT really was right in recommending these names. By doing this, we will see if these really can be considered stocks that will make you rich in 2023 and beyond.10 Stocks ChatGPT Said Will Make Me Rich in 10 YearsOur MethodologyIn March 2023 we asked ChatGPT to act like an expert stock picker and recommend some stocks that could make us rich in 10 years.

28,a2989796-4d92-3b50-8d31-d7cf2f57be1f,MSFT,2023-08-21,10 Stocks That Will Change the Future,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-stocks-change-future-201448931.html,1692562488,STORY,"['NVDA', 'MSFT', 'ROK', 'ABB.BO', 'MBLY', 'INMD', 'MDT']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at 10 stocks that will change the future. To skip our detailed analysis of how the market is transforming this year, you can go directly to see the 5 Stocks That Will Change the Future.Technological AdvancementsFrom the start of the year, we have been hearing about how new technology, artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation are some of the things that will significantly transform the world as we know it. Those who are skeptical about the impact of new technologies hold that such assertions are mere exaggerations. However, others are more inclined to believe that we may currently be in the midst of a new tech revolution. With the rise of new technologies, everything is beginning to change, ranging from how you interact with other people and live day-to-day to how you work and go about your professional life. Because new technological advancements are rapidly taking over the world, many companies are incorporating new tech and artificial intelligence in their operations, while those that have been operating in this space since their inception are continuing to get ahead.An example of one such company is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a semiconductor company that has been the talk of the town since the start of the year because of its stellar work in the artificial intelligence field. The company offers AI chips that have become increasingly popular among its customers and investors alike. Building on its momentum, on August 8, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also announced its release of an updated AI processor that is even more efficient than its earlier products. This move is being considered an attempt by the company to retain its dominance in the AI chips space. The new processor is called the Grace Hopper Superchip, and it is a combination graphics chip and processor. This is the world's first HBM3e processor and is designed specifically for the ""era of accelerated computing and generative AI."" The new chip is expected to be 50% faster than the company's current HBM3 processors, making it well-positioned to handle complex generative AI workloads. According to NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) report, the chip will begin to be produced in the second quarter of 2024.Story continuesInvestments In New TechThe creation of products like the Grace Hopper Superchip highlights how tech companies today are embracing the way new developments in their field are changing consumer expectations. This is also leading to companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) now working on meeting these changing expectations to offer faster, more efficient, and more cutting-edge technologies. At the same time, other major companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are doing their part in this area by developing their own technologies while investing in other companies that are steadily becoming leaders in this space. For instance, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) made an early move in generative AI with a $1 billion investment in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, in 2019. While this investment did not garner much attention at the time it was made, with the virality of ChatGPT today, both OpenAI and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have come under the spotlight. By this April, the latter's investment in the former was estimated to be about $13 billion, according to CNBC. This immense investment has also given the big tech giant an edge over other tech companies investing in AI since it now has access to OpenAI's generative AI technology, which it has steadily been incorporating into its own Bing search engine. The same technology has also been integrated into other Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) offerings, such as its sales and marketing software and the Azure cloud.With the way companies like these are rapidly incorporating new technologies into their products and services, it is highly likely that before long, the technology sector, along with several others, will become absolutely unrecognizable, exponentially faster, and immensely more efficient. Even healthcare companies like Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) are integrating artificial intelligence into their products. For example, the Medtronic Touch Surgery Enterprise is the first AI-powered surgical video management and analytics platform for operating rooms globally. At the same time, tech startups and companies are bringing highly innovative products and technologies to the table. DeepMind is one example of an AI company that has been working to combine machine learning and systems neuroscience to build learning algorithms. The company's AI system uses raw pixels as data input in its deep learning process, online other AI systems which are pre-programmed. DeepMind's success in the AI field and its ability to make innovative and different products in the area resulted in its acquisition by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in 2014.Another interesting private company is Numenta, which has been developing powerful neuroscience-based AI solutions. The company leverages the structures and efficiencies found in the brain to accelerate deep learning networks and make advanced AI systems. Numenta's work, if carried on as it is right now, may result in the creation of an AI system that functions similarly to the human brain, more so than any other AI system does today. These are just a few examples of how we are currently seeing the world change, but they are enough to highlight the fact that today there are many companies that are working hard to become part of a tech-oriented future. Considering the above, we have compiled a list of some stocks that will change the future for the long term based on their current operations. Many of these companies may even be considered some of the best growth stocks for the next five years.10 Stocks That Will Change the FuturePhoto by Maximalfocus on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe used a consensus opinion-based approach to find stocks that most sources online think will change the future.

29,89ccbb7d-179c-3f09-817d-dd5a99d1bd61,SIG,2023-08-21,Michael Burry’s Top 10 Stock Picks For Q3,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/michael-burry-top-10-stock-130057175.html,1692536457,STORY,"['TSLA', 'GNRC', 'CHTR', 'MGM', 'SIG', 'EXPE']","[In this piece, we will take a look at Michael Burry's top ten stock picks for Q3. If you want to skip out on our introduction to the famous hedge fund investor and the latest news about him, then head on over to Michael Burry's Top 5 Stock Picks For Q3. Few hedge fund owners have had movies made about them, and perhaps even fewer have predicted the Great Recession of 2008. Michael Burry, the hedge fund boss who ran Scion Capital back in 2008, has seen both, and he currently runs the private investment firm Scion Capital Group, LLC.Dr. Burry is one of the rare hedge fund investors in the industry who is not a Ph.D. doctor. Instead, he is a Doctor of Medicine, through a degree that he earned from the University of California, Los Angeles. He is also another rare hedge fund boss who is still licensed to practice medicine, as he regularly keeps up with the educational requirements needed to maintain the ability to practice medicine in the United States.In case you're unaware, Dr. Burry rose to prominence in the financial world when he correctly predicted that the real estate market in America would crash by 2007. His hypothesis was based on the fact that subprime mortgages, which are loans made to borrowers with low FICO scores, would rapidly drop in value once their teaser rates were replaced by higher rates. Since these loans formed the basis of financial assets such as mortgage backed securities, the broader implications of the subprime borrowers being unable to make their loan payments in the finance industry would be severe. Subsequently, Dr. Burry shorted the subprime market and proved his detractors wrong when he netted nearly a billion dollars in profit during a time when wealthy and regular Americans witnessed large wipeouts in their assets.However, since then, several of his predictions have proven to be wrong. One of Dr. Burry's most famous short positions has been against the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). He posted on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) in December 2020 that he was short on Tesla and advised the firm's chief Mr. Elon Musk that he should take advantage of the high share price back then to raise capital by issuing more shares. Adjusting for all stock splits to date, Tesla's shares were worth $235 as 2020 ended (they were trading above $550 before the splits when Burry made the bearish remarks), and since then, they gained nearly 81% in value to touch $407 in just 11 months. Currently, Tesla is trading around $225, having lost only $10 since Dr. Burry revealed his position.Story continuesGoing against Tesla isn't the only thing that Dr. Burry's been up to since the housing market crash before the Great Recession. One of his latest predictions came in January when he outlined on X:Inflation peaked. But it is not the last peak of this cycle. We are likely to see CPI lower, possibly negative in 2H 2023, and the US in recession by any definition.Fed will cut and government will stimulate. And we will have another inflation spike. It's not hard.Since then, the U.S. economy has grown during the second quarter, inflation has consistently fallen, and the Federal Reserve continues to hike interest rates. In fact, the Fed's potential decisions have created some unease among investors, who are uncertain whether robust economic data provides the central bank with more leeway to increase interest rates. At the same time, banks such as Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have either reduced their odds of a recession or scrapped the forecasts completely.With the second quarter hedge fund filing season upon us, Dr. Burry's private investment firm Scion Asset Management also filed its 13-F report with the SEC. This report created ripples in the market and the media as it revealed two massive bearish bets against the stock market. These are the largest bets in his portfolio, and cumulatively, they represent nearly 94% of Michael Burry's latest holdings. In investing, there are derivatives that are called options. They are of two kinds, namely a Put and a Call. Among these, a Put option is a bearish bet since it provides an investor with the opportunity to sell the shares at a predetermined price called the strike price.

(AP) — A judge has ordered Starbucks to pay an additional $2.7 million in lost wages and tax damages to a former regional manager who was earlier awarded more than $25 million after alleging she and other white employees were unfairly punished following the high-profile arrests of two Black men at a store in 2018.In June, Shannon Phillips won $600,000 in compensatory damages and $25 million in punitive damages after a jury in New Jersey found that race was a determinative factor in Phillips’ firing, in violation of federal and state anti-discrimination laws.The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that U.S. district judge Wednesday ordered Starbucks to pay Phillips another $2.73 million in past and future lost earnings and benefits as well as compensation for tax disadvantages due to the lump sum, according to court documents. The company opposed paying any amount, saying Philipps had not proven she couldn’t have earned the same or more in the future.In April 2018, a Philadelphia store manager called police on two Black men who were sitting in the coffee shop without ordering anything. Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson were later released without charges.Phillips, then regional manager of operations in Philadelphia, southern New Jersey, and elsewhere, was not involved with arrests. However, she said she was ordered to put a white manager who also wasn’t involved on administrative leave for reasons she knew were false, according to her lawsuit.Phillips, 52, said she was fired less than a month later after objecting to the manager being placed on leave amid the uproar, according to her lawsuit.The company’s rationale for suspending the district manager, who was not responsible for the store where the arrests took place, was an allegation that Black store managers were being paid less than white managers, according to the lawsuit. Phillips said that argument made no sense since district managers had no input on employee salaries.Story continuesThe lawsuit alleged Starbucks was instead taking steps to “punish white employees” who worked in the area “in an effort to convince the community that it had properly responded to the incident.”Starbucks lawyers had alleged that Phillips was fired because the company needed stronger leadership in the aftermath of the arrests.Starbucks is seeking a new trial, arguing that jurors were allowed to remain despite having expressed negative opinions about the company, that incorrect information in witness testimony “poisoned the well,” and that Phillips should not have been awarded “double damages” on both the state and federal allegations, the Inquirer reported.Phillips’ lawyers, meanwhile, also want Starbucks ordered to pay $1.4 million in legal fees from 2018 through 2023.Video of the arrest prompted a national outcry, and the company later reached a settlement with both men for an undisclosed sum and an offer of free college education.The two men reached a deal with the city of Philadelphia for a symbolic $1 each and a promise from officials to set up a $200,000 program for young entrepreneurs. The Philadelphia Police Department adopted a new policy on how to deal with people accused of trespassing on private property — warning businesses against misusing the authority of police officers.]"

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Parker-Hannifin's shares on or after the 25th of August, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 8th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.48 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$5.92 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Parker-Hannifin has a trailing yield of 1.5% on the current share price of $397.76. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Parker-Hannifin's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Parker-Hannifin has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Parker-Hannifin paying out a modest 34% of its earnings. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Parker-Hannifin generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 27% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's positive to see that Parker-Hannifin's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Fortunately for readers, Parker-Hannifin's earnings per share have been growing at 15% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings within the business. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Parker-Hannifin has delivered an average of 14% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.The Bottom LineHas Parker-Hannifin got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Parker-Hannifin has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. There's a lot to like about Parker-Hannifin, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.In light of that, while Parker-Hannifin has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Parker-Hannifin that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

32,a42eb993-8aaa-3bb1-a129-ae2882fede84,ADM,2023-08-21,Those who invested in Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) three years ago are up 103%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-archer-daniels-midland-140026267.html,1692540026,STORY,['ADM'],"[One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) share price is up 90% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 22% (not including dividends).So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Archer-Daniels-Midland was able to grow its EPS at 35% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 24% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 10.71 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Archer-Daniels-Midland has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. Take a more thorough look at Archer-Daniels-Midland's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Archer-Daniels-Midland, it has a TSR of 103% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 3.5% in the last year, Archer-Daniels-Midland shareholders lost 3.0% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 13% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Archer-Daniels-Midland   you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

33,7f5f791c-6f78-34c1-95f6-9b3488941b69,HST,2023-08-21,3 REITs Raising Their Dividend Game: Is it Time to Buy?,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reits-raising-dividend-game-184859182.html,1692038939,STORY,"['HST', 'REXR', 'INVH']","[Real estate investment trusts (REITs) have had a challenging go of it in the last few years. That meant smaller dividend increases. And it might not get better in the near term, which makes finding the best REITs to buy a more challenging task.In June, Fitch Ratings reduced its U.S. REIT sector outlook to Deteriorating from Neutral, primarily due to the tightening of commercial lending standards brought on by the regional banking issues.“Performance by property type will likely vary widely over the next two years. Sectors experiencing strong fundamentals, such as industrial and shopping centers, will likely see some cooling in demand, with tenants showing greater reluctance to lease space, including delaying decisions, resulting in less pricing power for landlords,” Fitch stated.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, some REITs are doing fine and continue to raise their dividend game to appeal to investors looking for reasonable income from their stocks.To qualify, a REIT must have a market capitalization of at least $12 billion and have increased its dividend by 15% over the past year. In addition, I’ll make sure to select REITs from three different property types.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (HST)Woman standing in hotel room with luggage looking at the view. Hotel stocks.Source: Boyloso / ShutterstockHost Hotels &amp; Resorts (NASDAQ:HST) is a hotel and resort REIT. It is the largest lodging REIT in the world. It owns a portfolio of 77 luxury and upscale hotels worldwide (72 in the U.S.) with 41,900 rooms.Of the major brand-managed hotels, Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) accounts for 60% of the properties owned, with Hyatt (NYSE:H) representing 21% and Four Seasons at 5%.In 2023, it expects its hotels to generate a $344 comparable hotel total revenue per available room (RevPAR), up 8.1% from 2022, with adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) of $1.86 a share.Its most recent acquisition was the Four Seasons Resort and Residences in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in November 2022. It paid $315 million for the 125-room luxury resort. The RevPAR at the resort is an eye-popping $855, making it one of the top three assets owned by the REIT.Story continuesIn June, the REIT declared a quarterly cash dividend of 15 cents, 25% higher than the previous payment. The 60-cent annual rate yields 3.7%.Host continues to push toward annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $2 billion, up from the $1.6 billion expected to earn in 2023.Rexford Industrial Realty (REXR)Factory pipes and towers at sunsetSource: ShutterstockRexford Industrial Realty (NYSE:REXR) is an industrial REIT. As is typical with this type of REIT, Rexford owns and redevelops industrial properties in Southern California. Its current portfolio comprises 358 properties with 43.6 million in rentable square feet.As e-commerce has slowed post-pandemic, industrial REITs have become less attractive to investors. However, that shouldn’t stop you from investing.On July 24th, 2023, the REIT announced that it had acquired an industrial property in the Los Angeles area for $210 million. The building acquired has nearly 600,000 square feet, sits on 22.4 acres, and is leased by two tenants. The building currently earns a levered cash yield of 5%, increasing to 6.2%, through annual rent escalations and higher rents from new tenants.In the second quarter, it generated core funds from operations (core FFO) of $108.4 million, nearly 33% higher than a year earlier. Meanwhile, its same property portfolio net operating income (NOI) increased by 8%. Its average occupancy rate is 98.0%. Regarding the balance sheet, its net debt is just 16% of its $10.9 billion enterprise value.In February, Rexford announced it had raised its quarterly dividend by 21%, to $0.38, from $0.315 in its January payment. The $1.52 annual rate yields 2.9%.Down 23% over the past year, now is a good time to consider taking a position.Invitation Homes (INVH)An aerial view of an idyllic neighborhood streetInvitation Homes (NYSE:INVH) is a leading owner of single-family rental properties in the U.S. It owns 82,837 homes, 92.5% of which it’s owned for the past 13 months. In July, the company acquired a portfolio of nearly 1,900 homes for $650 million. It paid for the homes primarily with cash and a small amount from its credit facility.In the second quarter, it acquired 276 homes for $88 million and sold 378 homes for $141 million. Its same-store NOI in Q2 2023 was $355.4 million, 3.6% higher than a year earlier and 1.3% higher than in Q1 2023.In July, I suggested that INVH was a stock to own for the next 50 years. I argued that because five large institutional investors owned 51% of its stock, the stability provided by these investors and their faith in the business was invaluable.Three things stand out about Invitation Homes’ business.First, more than 95% of its portfolio is located in growth areas, such as Florida and the Western U.S. Secondly, it averages approximately 5,200 homes for each of the 16 markets it’s in, providing plenty of scale. Lastly, it has boots on the ground, with over 1,000 operations personnel in each market, making it a top-notch landlord for renters interested in living in single-family dwellings.In February, Invitation raised its quarterly dividend to 26 cents from its previous payout of 22 cents, an 18.2% increase. The $1.04 annual rate yields 3.0%.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:PM) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International Philip Morris International Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Chairman of the Board, Andre Calantzopoulos, for US$8.0m worth of shares, at about US$100 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$94.36. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In the last year Philip Morris International insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Philip Morris International insiders own about US$228m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Philip Morris International Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Philip Morris International shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Philip Morris International insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Philip Morris International.

The purchase was aimed at broadening Goldman's client list beyond the ultra-rich, but the unit has remained a small part of the bank's wealth business.Goldman's private wealth arm oversees $1 trillion in assets for ultra-high net worth clients, who have $60 million or more in investable assets. High net worth individuals - who would fall within the business Goldman is considering selling - typically have about $1 million to $10 million to invest.Citywire RIA first reported on the possible sale.Story continuesGoldman's wealth business has lagged behind rivals, including Morgan Stanley, where CEO James Gorman built the wealth management arm through a series of acquisitions that generate steady income from fees.Solomon has been under pressure to turn around Goldman's fortunes after its profit sank 60% in the second quarter as writedowns on its consumer businesses and real estate investments weighed on earnings.The bank plans to grow its core wealth business serving ultra-high-net-worth clients, reiterating aspirations from its investor day in late February. Other core wealth businesses include workplace financial planning through Ayco and Marcus savings, Goldman said.U.S. banks compete to serve ultra-wealthy clients by providing brokerage, mortgage and other services, as well as estate and tax planning.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the energy sector, head directly to Goldman Sachs Energy Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks. Previously, we reported that global clean energy investment has surged due to COVID-19 recovery and energy crises. In 2023, around $2.8 trillion will be invested in energy, with over $1.7 trillion in clean energy, led by solar. Low-emissions power will account for 90% of total energy investment. Clean energy spending now exceeds the budget for fossil fuels, a shift from five years ago. Renewables and electric vehicles drive this momentum, along with batteries, heat pumps, and nuclear power. Moreover, the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts 1.3% energy consumption growth in 2023, hindered by high prices and economic slowdown. OPEC+ might cut production, impacting oil supply, and Russia faces oil output decline due to sanctions. Natural gas demand remains flat, coal grows slightly, while oil demand is rising in Asia but falling in Europe. Solar and wind energy consumption will grow by 11% in 2023 and continue expanding at 10% annually till 2031, with Asia being the market leader. Don't Miss: 10 Energy Stocks with Insider BuyingWhile clean energy continues to dominate headlines, industry leaders during the Energy Asia conference in Kuala Lumpur on June 29, 2023 emphasized that oil and gas will remain dominant energy sources for many years due to the moderate pace of the energy transition. Regarding clean energy, the global requirement is an annual investment of $4 trillion, a goal that is currently far from being achieved, as per John Hess, CEO of Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES). He also commented: “We think the biggest realization that should come out of this conference ... is oil and gas are needed for decades to come. Energy transition is going to take a lot longer, it’s going to cost a lot more money and need new technologies that don’t even exist today.”Story continuesA year ago, in the midst of the war in Ukraine and the resulting energy supply disturbances, Goldman Sachs Research forecasted a shift for the oil and gas sector. The firm expected the industry to transition from a period of limited investment to embracing substantial high-profile projects. Presently, this investment surge has materialized, and this is evident in the energy sector's 70 large-scale projects currently in progress worldwide. This marks a 25% increase as compared to 2020 levels. Per Goldman Sachs, three factors have contributed to the significant increase in energy capex. Firstly, the Russia-Ukraine conflict highlighted the need for energy investments. Secondly, the combination of strong investment profitability and the urgency of the conflict provided compelling incentives for these projects. Lastly, the ongoing post-Covid demand recovery has further propelled the double-digit growth in capex.Also Read: 15 Worst Performing Energy Stocks in 2023On July 31, 2023, Goldman Sachs increased its global oil demand forecast for the year and maintained a 12-month Brent price projection of $93 per barrel. The rise in inventories offset the demand boost from a more optimistic growth outlook. In July, global oil demand reached a record high of 102.8 million barrels per day, according to Goldman analysts. They anticipate a larger-than-expected 1.8 million bpd deficit in the second half of the year and a 0.6 million bpd deficit in 2024, driven by strong demand. The reduced risk of recession and OPEC's efforts to raise prices contribute to Goldman's expectation of higher oil prices and reduced volatility.In this article, we look at Goldman Sachs’ top energy stocks, which include SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A). Our Methodology We used Goldman Sachs’ Q2 2023 portfolio and selected the 12 biggest positions in energy companies during the quarter for this list.

The share price increased by one third. Notably, the portfolio generated significant returns from energy stocks, including Suncor, Tenaris, Imperial Oil and tangentially Alimentation Couche-Tarde and Seven &amp; i Holdings, both of which are in the gas station business. Given the cyclicality and commodity nature of the oil business, we have sold shares of these investments, including the complete sale of both Tenaris and Imperial Oil.”11. Cheniere Energy, Inc.

Notably, Cheniere paid down $1.3 billion of long-term debt and repurchased $75 million of common stock during the quarter. Cheniere is well positioned to benefit from ongoing tightness in global gas markets.”10.

The company raised full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $12.9-13.3B from $10.6-11.0B previously, with the increase largely related to the benefits realized from Winter Storm Uri. The company paid down $3.7B in debt during the quarter, using strong cash flow to reduce leverage. The company also announced the issuance of $900M in 6.5% Series H perpetual preferreds with the company using the proceeds to repay debt and for general purposes.”9.

The company has an extensive resource base of high-quality drilling inventory in the U.S. and various international locations as well as a growing liquified natural gas business. In our view, the depth and quality of ConocoPhillips’s inventory is a competitive differentiator that is not fully captured in today’s share price. Over the next 10 years, we believe ConocoPhillips will be able to return more than 100% of its current market cap to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases while growing its production at a mid-single-digit annual pace. We believe ConocoPhillips is also among the best managed companies in the oil and gas industry and we are impressed by its history of accretive capital allocation under CEO Ryan Lance. The stock has meaningfully underperformed the broader market year-to-date and is an attractive addition to our portfolio.”8.

Its upstream segment explores for, produces, processes and transfers energy products. Its downstream segment refines and markets these products in addition to industrial plastics and fuel and lubricant additives. Among the major oil companies, CVX is the most levered to oil and gas production; it has one of the most successful exploration programs and among the best production profiles. CVX also has less exposure to the downstream business, which provides an above-peer operating margin profile and supports CVX’s return on invested capital. CVX has one of the strongest balance sheets in the oil industry with net debt/EBITDA of just 0.1x. The combination of its low cost positioning and strong balance sheet gives us greater confidence in downside protection despite its ties to a volatile commodity. We’re attracted to management’s rational approach to capital allocation, with consideration for the full cycle. In terms of capital allocation, CVX just announced a $75B share repurchase plan, and it pays a healthy 3.5% dividend. We have owned CVX in the past and it is the only Energy exposure in the Large Cap portfolio.”7. NextEra Energy, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ENPH) is one of the top energy stocks in the Goldman Sachs portfolio. Aristotle Atlantic Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) designs, develops, manufactures and sells home energy solutions in the U.S. and internationally for the solar industry. The company is the world’s leading manufacturer of microinverters that convert solar-generated D.C. energy to A.C. energy usable in homes and buildings. Enphase introduced the world’s first microinverter system in 2008 and has expanded its offerings to include battery storage systems and proprietary technologies that provide energy monitoring and control services for solar energy systems. It sells its products and solutions directly to solar system distributors, large installers and strategic partners.We see Enphase having a substantial market share that is gained through a premium product offering, superior customer service and the development of a large and diverse network of solar installers and distributors. The company’s products and services address a growing residential solar market. Coupling battery backup systems with existing and newly installed residential solar systems could accelerate the company’s revenue and earnings growth over the next several years, in our view. Additionally, commercial and international expansion offer additional revenue and earnings upside. Enphase also plans to expand manufacturing capacity in the U.S. during 2023 to benefit from tax incentives related to domestic production included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).”   Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Energy Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:Mohnish Pabrai’s 10 Biggest Investments in 10 Years15 Cheapest Stocks Warren Buffett Owns10 Dividend Stocks with Over 8% Yield Disclosure: None.

40,8e0a8e03-280f-3a74-82df-6e282e88d53a,GS,2023-08-21,Goldman Sachs has a David Solomon problem,The Economist,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-david-solomon-problem-173051779.html,1692552651,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[It began as a steady drip of criticism, including on the cover of The Economist , concerning Goldman Sachs’s patchy performance during his tenure as chief executive. The firm’s foray into consumer banking was setting fire to a chunk of its dwindling profits. Efforts to move into businesses that promised steadier revenues than trading and proprietary investments were coming up short. And all this was producing tension between the firm’s divisions. But it has now become something more brutal: a cacophony of people outlining the myriad ways in which they dislike David Solomon.Complaints have come from Mr Solomon’s underlings, who have told reporters that he is “not likeable” and is, quite simply, “a prick”. They have also come from his predecessor: Lloyd Blankfein was reported by the Wall Street Journal to have complained about Mr Solomon’s use of the company’s private jets to go to music festivals, where he performs under the name “dj d-Sol”, rather than spending time on the day job.The mutiny at Goldman has become so open that those grousing no longer even bother to do it in private. According to Bloomberg, at a lively steakhouse dinner in Manhattan last month a group of senior managers complained about Mr Solomon’s shortcomings in the presence of John Waldron, the firm’s chief operating officer and Mr Solomon’s longtime lieutenant. In July Larry Fink, boss of BlackRock, said on television that there was an obvious “schism” at the bank. Even students are getting in on the act. After a visit by Mr Solomon to Hamilton College three youngsters penned an open letter complaining that their conversation with him about climate change had “racist and sexist undertones”, something Goldman disputes.His increasingly precarious employment is now the butt of jokes. Steven Starker, a former Goldmanite who founded btig, a brokerage firm, recently moderated a soiree in the Hamptons, which Gary Cohn, Goldman’s former chief operating officer, and Larry Summers, a former treasury secretary, attended. “If you happen to see him [Mr Cohn] leave early, that means they’re probably calling him because he’s a candidate to be the future ceo of Goldman Sachs,” quipped Mr Starker.Story continuesFew think Goldman should be run by a teddy bear. This is the firm that was characterised in 2009 as a “great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money”. But there is a difference between being disliked for being smart, ruthless and more successful than everyone else, and the kind of personal vitriol that is currently being spewed. It is increasingly embarrassing for Goldman that its boss is being laughed at in rarefied circles, and that employees see fit to make petty criticisms.The situation is evidence of a deep rot within the firm, one which it is hard to see being improved without either Mr Solomon or many of those who loathe him leaving their positions. The question for the board, then, is whether to push him out.In Mr Solomon’s defence, the firm’s performance on his watch has been patchy rather than dreadful; more “Goldman Sags” than “Goldman Sucks”. Shareholders who bought Goldman stock on the day he took charge in 2018 have earned a decent annualised return of 10%, worse than those who bought shares in Morgan Stanley, Goldman’s closest rival—but better than those who bought Citigroup.The firm’s poor earnings for the past three quarters do reflect some strategic errors. Goldman has taken heavy losses in its consumer-banking efforts, and has written down the value of its acquisitions in the industry. Sluggish profits also reflect its failure to cut its proprietary investment arm quickly enough. But Mr Solomon has recognised these issues and is adapting the firm’s strategy. His returns for shareholders should have earned him enough goodwill for an attempt at course correction. He is reported, for now, to retain the support of big investors and the board.Cold analysis of the figures might not be enough to save Mr Solomon in the long term, however. Although it always seems trite when bankers proclaim that the most valuable part of their firm is the employees, it is probably true for Goldman. The firm does not make money by, say, investing in machinery to make computer chips for which it owns the designs. It does so, in large part, by hiring smart, competitive people and getting them to work insanely hard to bring in deals, trade assets and come up with investment strategies. If these employees dislike the boss, they will leave.That is exactly what is happening at Goldman. The bank typically has around 400 partners, adding 60-70 new ones every couple of years. Some 200 have left the firm since Mr Solomon took charge—a high attrition rate. Even more concerning is that the list includes many who were considered contenders for the top job, such as Gregg Lemkau, a dealmaker, and some of the firm’s highest-earning partners, such as Julian Salisbury, who ran the asset-management business. Even if the board wanted to oust Mr Solomon, there would be no clear successor. The problem with waiting to see how things develop is that there might be even fewer options by the time the knife is wielded.© 2023 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

(NYSE:GS) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 28th of September to $2.75. This will take the annual payment to 3.4% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Goldman Sachs Group's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 63.8%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 31% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendGoldman Sachs Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $2.00 total annually to $11.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 19% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. We are encouraged to see that Goldman Sachs Group has grown earnings per share at 13% per year over the past five years. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders.Goldman Sachs Group Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Goldman Sachs Group is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.

(NYSE:GPN) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/87-ownership-shares-global-payments-104402894.html,1692614642,STORY,['GPN'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Global Payments' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions51% of the business is held by the top 17 shareholders Insiders have sold recently Every investor in Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 87% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Global Payments. See our latest analysis for Global Payments ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Global Payments?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Global Payments. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Global Payments' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Global Payments. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.8% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.1% and 4.8% of the stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 17 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Global PaymentsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Global Payments Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$291m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Global Payments. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Global Payments better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Global Payments (including 1 which is a bit concerning) .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

43,53a82afc-9f30-389c-8f45-cdf51bf30cff,SLB,2023-08-21,7 Blue-Chip Stocks Smart Investors Should Be Loading Up on Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-blue-chip-stocks-smart-202503544.html,1692044703,STORY,"['AMT', 'ABBV', 'TEF', 'TXN', 'MDT', 'SLB']","[There’s a reasonable argument to be made that investors should load up on blue-chip stocks regularly. After all, large and well-established firms with long track records of success are likely to continue to be successful. Growth in blue-chip companies may be lower than it is in the tech sector but safety and lower volatility arguably tip the balance in favor of blue chips. That notion holds as true now as it ever has. Whether it’s your first time investing or you adhere to a strategy like dollar cost averaging, now is a great time to pick up one or more blue-chip stocks. American Tower REIT (AMT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the American Tower (AMT) website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAmerican Tower REIT (NYSE:AMT) is a stock that will provide investors with a few important things. One, it will provide income through a dividend. As a real estate investment trust (REIT), AMT is legally obligated to distribute 90% of taxable earnings to shareholders. Two, American Tower REIT is a relatively safe way to invest in the growth of 5G as a specialty REIT in the communications tower leasing space. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOn a per-share basis, American Tower’s distributions increased by 9.8% in Q2 year-over-year. Yet AMT stock has fallen throughout 2023 as net income has decreased. Net income has been negatively affected by unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Remunerations to the U.S. headquarters are more expensive, decreasing income overall. The majority of American Tower’s revenue is internationally derived. That means AMT will benefit from a weakening dollar overall. American Tower REIT is a strong choice in blue-chip stocks for the fact that revenues have grown quickly over the past 3 years combined with its 5G exposure Schlumberger (SLB) slb stockSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.comSchlumberger (NYSE:SLB) stock recently fell following second-quarter earnings that disappointed on a muted domestic drilling outlook. An increasingly positive outlook for international and offshore drilling was not sufficient to prevent the decline. Drilling productivity numbers can be found here for U.S. domestic markets. Story continuesSchlumberger provides services to firms that engage in drilling so it clearly hopes that drilling volumes will increase both domestically, internationally and offshore. However, I’d argue that the reaction was overblown even if SLB shares have basically been flat. Revenues and earnings were pretty much right where Wall Street expected. Revenues increased by 20% and EPS jumped by 44% year-over-year. There’s another reason to believe in Schlumberger outside of its strong quarterly growth figures. Schlumberger derives more than 75% of its sales from international markets. Remember, the international outlook is strong. That should give investors reason to be optimistic at this point because share prices have remained flat but its greatest revenue producer is expected to be strong. AbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comMost investors know that AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) stock is facing a rough patch as Humira continues to fall off after its reign as a blockbuster drug. If the company and stock are to remain at the top, it will be because of other drugs picking up the slack. There’s evidence that that is exactly what’s happening. Humira is the leading drug within AbbVie’s immunology portfolio and its leading revenue producer overall. Luckily, as Humira comes off patent and sales slump other immunology products are ramping up. Humira sales fell by 25% year-over-year. However, Rinvoq and Skyrizi are filling the void. Both drugs’ sales increased by more than 50% in Q2. Revenues were roughly $400 million ahead of analysts’ expectations. That’s excellent news for the company since the beat was driven by non-Humira sales. It’s exactly what investors should be hoping for from AbbVie. It paves the way forward for the firm to transition into new revenue streams perhaps quicker than expected. That softens the blow of a declining Humira. Don’t forget, ABBV includes a nice dividend, making it an ideal option in blue-chip stocks. Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comColgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) has done what a lot of consumer goods firms have done in 2023. It’s raised prices while volumes have slipped. Fortunately, it has worked and resulted in increasing sales. For example, sales volumes fell by 1.5% in the second quarter but net sales increased by 7.5%. CPG firms have clearly been able to grow by charging more for their products. Inflation numbers show that to be the case. And shoppers are fully aware of it as well. Yet, it hasn’t negatively affected firms across the sector for the most part. Investors haven’t punished CPG firms. That could be changing soon. Investors are growing tired of the higher prices and lower volumes equation as inflation subsides. Colgate-Palmolive hasn’t stated that it anticipates volume growth even as Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) did. That’s the gamble: If Colgate-Palmolive can push sales volumes up this quarter it’ll grow quickly. The company does expect overall sales to grow by as much as 8% this year though. Texas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) stock has been quite volatile in 2023 even though its beta of 1 indicates it moves in step with the broader market. The reason that matters is that it opens a possibility to play the shares in the short term. TXN shares have shown distinct peaks and valleys this year moving from $160 to $180 and back to $160 again. It is again moving toward $160 after sales contracted in Q2 and the firm gave a Q3 revenue forecast just below the midpoint. The midpoint of $4.59 billion is slightly higher than the $4.55 billion midpoint Texas Instruments gave. However, it ranges as high as $4.74 billion so the company has the potential to surprise positively.  That’s a gamble worth taking given that Texas Instruments is a relatively stable firm in a semiconductor industry that is known to be anything but. Further, Texas Instruments pays an additional 3% through dividends. Telefonica (TEF) The logo for Telefonica SA displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.comTelefonica (NYSE:TEF) is a Spanish telecommunications firm that provides voice, data and internet. It’s also a penny stock that trades for under $4 and includes a nice dividend. Let’s start there because the upside inherent in the firm is its most attractive factor. There’s roughly 33% upside in TEF shares for investors who are willing to hold the shares for a year. It trades for less than $4 but including dividends and price predictions, it is reasonable to expect that shares could provide $5.29 of value in a year’s time. Telefonica also offers value in that its price-to-earnings ratio is better than 61% of industry-wide competitors. Telefonica’s revenues grew by 4.1% and 3.3% in the first half and A2, respectively. The firm increased guidance for organic revenue growth from low single digits to 4% when it released earnings. That’s generally a good sign overall that the company can reach its goals moving forward and increase share prices.  Medtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comI like Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) stock because it’s safe and provides income to investors. The medical device firm hasn’t traded as low as it does currently since the pandemic erupted. It’s quite cheap. However, it has also been very reliable for investors over the last decade. MDT shares returned 7.27% during that period on an annualized basis. That’s well ahead of the average stock during the same period. Additionally, that figure excludes Medtronic’s dividend which pays above 3% and has not been reduced since 1978. Medtronic is also a low-beta stock that tends to preserve investor capital well. There’s good reason to believe that Medtronic will continue to grow in 2023 and well beyond. The company has more than 210 active clinical trials underway and has invested $2.7 billion in R&amp;D this year. Overall, MDT shares are simply a reasonable investment, especially for investors looking to add healthcare blue-chip stocks to their portfolios. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

True, the Federal Reserve and its largely aggressive measures to tackle inflation through raising the benchmark interest rate in principle drive down the price of commodities, including hydrocarbon products. However, a few factors contribute to the sector’s rise.First, the revenge travel phenomenon that dominated business headlines in 2022 continues to play a strong role this year. Some of it has to do with Asian countries opening up near the back half of 2022 to early 2023. Therefore, even with the Fed’s hawkish policy, energy stocks have ticked higher recently. Second, the return-to-office pivot will likely undergird oil and gas stocks. It’s at a point now where big corporations like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are warning their employees about ignoring in-office mandates. It’s almost certain that worker bees will acquiesce because they don’t have unlimited funds.So, whether we like it or not, oil and gas stocks may continue to rise throughout this year. Below are some names to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsChevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with ""diesel"" and ""food mart"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAn integrated play among oil stocks to buy, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) deals with all components of the energy value chain: upstream (exploration and production), midstream (storage and transportation), and downstream (refining and marketing). Since the start of the year, CVX slipped about 6%, which doesn’t seem encouraging. However, in the trailing month, it’s up nearly 3%.Fundamentally, Chevron offers relatively stable exposure for those seeking energy stocks. Aside from a blip in 2016 and, of course, in 2020, the company is consistently profitable. It commands a trailing-year net margin of 14.09%, beating out almost 68% of its peers. As well, it features a return on asset (ROA) of 11.76%, outflanking 78.81% of sector rivals.Story continuesCurrently, Wall Street analysts peg CVX as a consensus moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as 11 buys, six holds and zero sells. Further, the experts’ average price target lands at $188.06, implying almost 15% upside potential.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comA specialist in the midstream component of the energy value chain, Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) offers a vital connection between enterprises that produce raw hydrocarbons and entities that refine the material for use in various applications, including into our combustion-powered vehicles. From a year-to-date perspective, KMI doesn’t seem that impressive, down more than 1%. However, in the past month, it’s shown modest signs of life.Fundamentally, this framework should improve, especially if more cars are on the road due to social normalization protocols (such as the return to the office). To be fair, it’s a bit riskier than other oil stocks to buy. For example, shares trade at a forward multiple of 15.26, which is quite overvalued. However, investors shouldn’t ignore that it’s been consistently profitable over the past decade.That’s not surprising given the relevance of midstream operators. Presently, analysts peg KMI as a consensus moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as three buys, six holds and zero sells. Also, the average expert price target lands at $20.88, implying over 17% upside potential.Phillips 66 (PSX)Phillips 66 gas station in the daytimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA downstream specialist, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) deserves closer consideration regarding oil stocks to buy. Data from the U.S. Federal Highway Administration shows that vehicle miles traveled have been steadily increasing since the doldrums of the Covid-19 pandemic. It’s not quite to the levels seen prior to the public health crisis. But that’s also the upside opportunity for PSX stock.Basically, the underlying company’s total addressable market should theoretically only rise from here. That’s not a guarantee, to be clear. However, social trends point to the normalization of pre-pandemic standards, not to what we believe the post-pandemic paradigm should be. Therefore, the downstream component of energy stocks should warrant closer investigation.Notably, Wall Street analysts aren’t waiting around for retail investors to wake up. Presently, they tag PSX as a consensus moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as eight buys, three holds and zero sells. Also, the average price target comes in at $125.70, implying almost 8% upside potential.Devon Energy (DVN)An image of a hand holding a smartphone displaying the Devon Energy Corporation logo in front of a computer screenSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comAn independent entity among oil and gas stocks, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) offers investors a higher-risk, higher-reward profile. For example, DVN slipped more than 13% since the beginning of this year. Obviously, that’s not a great look, especially compared to the supermajors. However, Devon is attempting to claw back from its hole. In the trailing one-month period, shares have “only” lost a little more than 1%.Again, that’s not necessarily an encouraging look for risk-intolerant investors. However, should you believe in the pivoting fundamentals to a bullish outlook, DVN should offer substantially more upside. In the meantime, prospective buyers of oil stocks may consider the value proposition. For instance, DVN trades at a trailing multiple of 6.9. As a discount to earnings, Devon ranks better than 60% of other energy stocks.Looking at Wall Street, analysts peg DVN as a moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as eight buys and seven holds. Further, the average price target hits $61.87, implying nearly 23% upside potential.Halliburton (HAL)The Halliburton (HAL) logo on the website homepage. HAL stock price prediction.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comOne of the biggest oilfield services companies, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) provides products and services for the ever-evolving needs of the energy industry, per its website. While market participants often focus on “direct” plays regarding oil stocks to buy, an enterprise like Halliburton deserves closer attention. After all, if demand for hydrocarbons picks up, sector-related services firms will likely ride coattails.Notably, HAL gained slightly over 8% since the beginning of this year. In the trailing one-month period, shares swung up over 7%. Given the fundamental rise in energy stocks, Halliburton may have more room to run. Therefore, I’m not particularly worried about its earnings multiples, which admittedly run on the high side. Instead, I’m focused on compelling metrics, such as stronger-than-average operating and net margins.Also, the Street has spoken, with HAL earning a unanimous strong buy. And that’s not a cheap unanimous vote as it’s among 15 experts. Further, their average price target stands at $45.50, implying nearly 12% upside potential.Transocean (RIG)Person holding smartphone with logo of offshore drilling company Transocean Ltd. (RIG) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comUnquestionably one of the hottest names among oil stocks to buy, Transocean (NYSE:RIG) is the world’s largest offshore drilling contractor based on revenue, per its public profile. On a technical level, RIG has acutely felt the bullish pivot in the hydrocarbon space. Since the start of the year, shares have nearly doubled in value. They continue to impress, with shares gaining over 7% in the past 30 (calendar) days.Fundamentally, Transocean symbolizes the dramatic sentiment shift in the offshore oil space. During the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, offshore oil drillers ranked among the worst investments of 2020. Now, it’s one of the best plays. Further, despite their significantly overvalued profile (based on commonly gauged valuation metrics), there could be more upside remaining.Basically, normalization trends will continue to positively undergird energy stocks. And you know what? Analysts agree, pegging RIG a moderate buy. As well, the high-side price target of $12 calls for almost 40% upside potential.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD)Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD) logo seen on a smartphone with a green and yellow backgroundSource: rafapress / ShutterstockOne of the top independent oil and gas stocks, Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) is off to a solid start compared to sector rivals. Since the beginning of this year, PXD gained almost 8%. Most impressively, in the trailing one-month period, shares swung up nearly 10%. For those that want a more adventurous idea in the hydrocarbon space, PXD could fill this niche.Financially, Pioneer offers a well-balanced profile. Overall, it commands solid fiscal stability, as evidenced by its Altman Z-Score of 3.92. Operationally, Pioneer prints a three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 18.7%, beating out 67.41% of its peers. Further, its net margin clocks in at 28.39%, above 80.23% of the competition.Lastly, analysts are generally enthusiastic about PXD, although some doubters exist. Overall, the consensus view is a moderate buy. This rating breaks down as eight buys, nine holds and two sells. Finally, the average price target comes out to $252.11, implying over 6% upside.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/78-ownership-shares-amgen-inc-130029791.html,1692536429,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Amgen's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 25 shareholders own 48% of the company Recent sales by insiders A look at the shareholders of Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 78% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Amgen. View our latest analysis for Amgen ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amgen?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Amgen. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Amgen's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Amgen. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.1% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.8% and 5.4% of the stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of AmgenThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Amgen Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$224m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 22% stake in Amgen. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Amgen   (of which 1 is concerning!) you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

These companies, involved in locating, extracting, and processing valuable minerals vital for global industries, play an essential role as a growth engine for the global economy. Without various important base metals, entire industries wouldn’t be possible. Indeed, these companies may be viewed as pick-and-shovel play into various long-term secular growth trends.That said, there are reasons why some investors may not want to go all-in on this sector right now. If we are indeed headed into a recession, demand for various metals and minerals will undoubtedly decrease. And while the names listed below are among the best relative options in their sectors, this thesis generally holds true.Thus, the mining stocks below are ones I think are solid long-term bets, but much more attractive at lower levels. While I wouldn’t back up the truck right now, investors may want to make room on their trucks to add these stocks at more depressed levels.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNewmont Mining (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockNewmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) is a major player among top dividend gold stocks, also producing copper, silver, zinc, and lead. With a strong global portfolio, Newmont operates in favorable mining areas across multiple continents. However, despite its significance, NEM’s equity value declined by over 15% recently.Newmont anticipates a $400 million rise in free cash flow with every $100 increase in gold price, potentially leading to a $2 billion annual increase with a $500 gold price surge. For those bullish on such a move materializing, Newmont would certainly have much-improved dividend, credit, and valuation metrics. The company’s recent $20 billion agreement to acquire Newcrest Mining will bolster its gold reserves, and diversify the company into copper production without straining Newmont’s credit profile.Story continuesFor daring investors, Newmont presents an opportunity to grab a leading dividend gold stock at an appealing markdown. While the Covid-19 crisis affected its business and led to losses from lower gold prices, Newmont maintains a solid 11.1% operating margin, outperforming most peers.Nutrien (NTR)A photo of Nutrien's (NTR) website, with a magnifying glass over the logo.Source: Pavel Kapysh/ShutterStock.comNutrien (NYSE:NTR), the world’s largest fertilizer company, reported an 88% Q2 profit drop to $448 million. This attributes to lower fertilizer prices and weak potash sales abroad. Earnings per share fell to 89 cents from $6.51 year over year, proving a big drop.The company foresees continued negative impacts on earnings and sales due to low prices and demand through mid-2024, possibly influenced by a global economic downturn. NTR stock declined 23% in the past year.Nutrien navigated war-induced volatility, with crop nutrient sales surging due to Ukraine conflict disrupting exports. However, stable factory operations led to price decline. While NTR’s EBITDA forecast slightly lowered for 2023, the stock shows potential for around $20 upside. As a global commodities leader, it offers portfolio inflation protection. Consider owning it for potential market inflation ahead.Teck Resources (TECK)construction workers point at mining equipment in the near distanceSource: ShutterstockTeck Resources (NYSE:TECK) stands out as a consistent and impressive performer, delivering positive returns amid market uncertainties. With a 129% rally in the past three years and an 11% increase in 2023, Teck stock currently trades at $56.27 per share, outperforming the TSX Composite benchmark’s 3.8% year-to-date rise.TECK opened at $41.94, presenting an appealing diversification opportunity with a $21.47 billion market cap and price-earnings ratio of 16.98. The company’s resilience to market shifts is evident with a beta of 1.07, aligning its movement with the broader market for stability.In 2023, commodity market weakness impacted mining’s profitability. Teck’s Q2 EBITDA fell 55% to $1.48B, revenue dropped 39.2% YoY to $3.52B. Macroeconomic volatility may further impact commodity prices and Teck’s short-term results.

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics Is General Dynamics Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.11bUS$4.33bUS$4.50bUS$4.76bUS$4.95bUS$5.12bUS$5.28bUS$5.42bUS$5.57bUS$5.70bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x9Analyst x4Analyst x2Est @ 4.02%Est @ 3.46%Est @ 3.06%Est @ 2.79%Est @ 2.60%Est @ 2.46% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% US$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.7kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$3.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$35bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.7b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.5%– 2.2%) = US$134bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$134b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%)10= US$72bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$107b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$224, the company appears quite good value at a 43% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at General Dynamics as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.868. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for General DynamicsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace &amp; Defense market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the energy sector, head directly to Goldman Sachs Energy Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks. Previously, we reported that global clean energy investment has surged due to COVID-19 recovery and energy crises. In 2023, around $2.8 trillion will be invested in energy, with over $1.7 trillion in clean energy, led by solar. Low-emissions power will account for 90% of total energy investment. Clean energy spending now exceeds the budget for fossil fuels, a shift from five years ago. Renewables and electric vehicles drive this momentum, along with batteries, heat pumps, and nuclear power. Moreover, the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts 1.3% energy consumption growth in 2023, hindered by high prices and economic slowdown. OPEC+ might cut production, impacting oil supply, and Russia faces oil output decline due to sanctions. Natural gas demand remains flat, coal grows slightly, while oil demand is rising in Asia but falling in Europe. Solar and wind energy consumption will grow by 11% in 2023 and continue expanding at 10% annually till 2031, with Asia being the market leader. Don't Miss: 10 Energy Stocks with Insider BuyingWhile clean energy continues to dominate headlines, industry leaders during the Energy Asia conference in Kuala Lumpur on June 29, 2023 emphasized that oil and gas will remain dominant energy sources for many years due to the moderate pace of the energy transition. Regarding clean energy, the global requirement is an annual investment of $4 trillion, a goal that is currently far from being achieved, as per John Hess, CEO of Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES). He also commented: “We think the biggest realization that should come out of this conference ... is oil and gas are needed for decades to come. Energy transition is going to take a lot longer, it’s going to cost a lot more money and need new technologies that don’t even exist today.”Story continuesA year ago, in the midst of the war in Ukraine and the resulting energy supply disturbances, Goldman Sachs Research forecasted a shift for the oil and gas sector. The firm expected the industry to transition from a period of limited investment to embracing substantial high-profile projects. Presently, this investment surge has materialized, and this is evident in the energy sector's 70 large-scale projects currently in progress worldwide. This marks a 25% increase as compared to 2020 levels. Per Goldman Sachs, three factors have contributed to the significant increase in energy capex. Firstly, the Russia-Ukraine conflict highlighted the need for energy investments. Secondly, the combination of strong investment profitability and the urgency of the conflict provided compelling incentives for these projects. Lastly, the ongoing post-Covid demand recovery has further propelled the double-digit growth in capex.Also Read: 15 Worst Performing Energy Stocks in 2023On July 31, 2023, Goldman Sachs increased its global oil demand forecast for the year and maintained a 12-month Brent price projection of $93 per barrel. The rise in inventories offset the demand boost from a more optimistic growth outlook. In July, global oil demand reached a record high of 102.8 million barrels per day, according to Goldman analysts. They anticipate a larger-than-expected 1.8 million bpd deficit in the second half of the year and a 0.6 million bpd deficit in 2024, driven by strong demand. The reduced risk of recession and OPEC's efforts to raise prices contribute to Goldman's expectation of higher oil prices and reduced volatility.In this article, we look at Goldman Sachs’ top energy stocks, which include SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A). Our Methodology We used Goldman Sachs’ Q2 2023 portfolio and selected the 12 biggest positions in energy companies during the quarter for this list. We have mentioned Goldman Sachs’ stake value and the hedge fund sentiment towards each stock as of the second quarter of 2023. The list is ranked in the ascending order of the firm’s stake value in each holding. Goldman Sachs Energy Stocks: Top 12 Stock PicksPhoto by David Thielen on UnsplashGoldman Sachs Energy Stocks: Top Stock Picks12.

The share price increased by one third. Notably, the portfolio generated significant returns from energy stocks, including Suncor, Tenaris, Imperial Oil and tangentially Alimentation Couche-Tarde and Seven &amp; i Holdings, both of which are in the gas station business. Given the cyclicality and commodity nature of the oil business, we have sold shares of these investments, including the complete sale of both Tenaris and Imperial Oil.”11. Cheniere Energy, Inc.

Notably, Cheniere paid down $1.3 billion of long-term debt and repurchased $75 million of common stock during the quarter.

The company has an extensive resource base of high-quality drilling inventory in the U.S. and various international locations as well as a growing liquified natural gas business. In our view, the depth and quality of ConocoPhillips’s inventory is a competitive differentiator that is not fully captured in today’s share price. Over the next 10 years, we believe ConocoPhillips will be able to return more than 100% of its current market cap to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases while growing its production at a mid-single-digit annual pace. We believe ConocoPhillips is also among the best managed companies in the oil and gas industry and we are impressed by its history of accretive capital allocation under CEO Ryan Lance.

Its upstream segment explores for, produces, processes and transfers energy products. Its downstream segment refines and markets these products in addition to industrial plastics and fuel and lubricant additives. Among the major oil companies, CVX is the most levered to oil and gas production; it has one of the most successful exploration programs and among the best production profiles. CVX also has less exposure to the downstream business, which provides an above-peer operating margin profile and supports CVX’s return on invested capital. CVX has one of the strongest balance sheets in the oil industry with net debt/EBITDA of just 0.1x. The combination of its low cost positioning and strong balance sheet gives us greater confidence in downside protection despite its ties to a volatile commodity. We’re attracted to management’s rational approach to capital allocation, with consideration for the full cycle. In terms of capital allocation, CVX just announced a $75B share repurchase plan, and it pays a healthy 3.5% dividend. We have owned CVX in the past and it is the only Energy exposure in the Large Cap portfolio.”7. NextEra Energy, Inc.

(NYSE:TSN) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/66-ownership-tyson-foods-inc-104717858.html,1692614837,STORY,['TSN'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Tyson Foods implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 8 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessIf you want to know who really controls Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 66% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Tyson Foods, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Tyson Foods ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Tyson Foods?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Tyson Foods does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Tyson Foods' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Tyson Foods. Tyson Limited Partnership is currently the company's largest shareholder with 20% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 11% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.0% by the third-largest shareholder.On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 8 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Tyson FoodsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Tyson Foods, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$217m. Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 13% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Private Company OwnershipOur data indicates that Private Companies hold 20%, of the company's shares. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   4 warning signs for Tyson Foods  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

If you want to skip our introduction to the investor and growth investing, then head on to Warren Buffett's 5 Growth Stock Picks. Warren Buffett is one of the most successful investors of our time. His investment strategy depends on identifying firms with solid business models that are primed for growth and market capture to profit from the resulting boost to the share price. He also has one of the largest non-bank investment portfolios in the stock market, with our research suggesting that Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio by the end of this year's second quarter was worth a whopping $348 billion. The investments in the portfolio are not evenly spread out, since Berkshire's biggest stake is in the Cupertino, California consumer technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). This stake is worth an unbelievable $177 billion and accounts for 51% of Mr. Buffett's overall holdings.However, while he might be absolutely sure about the future prospects of Apple, a firm that also pays a 24 cent dividend for a 0.55% yield, the second quarter saw Mr. Buffett take a bullish stance on a different sector. The Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes this year have pummeled a lot of sectors, and one of the hardest hit among these has been the real estate industry. Within real estate, office companies have been hit particularly hard since not only have the high rates made it difficult for firms to raise capital and make payments on existing loans, but the trend towards remote working has also left office property owners scratching their heads. For more details, check out 15 Worst Performing REITs in 2023.While Mr. Buffett kept away from the office real estate sector, he did buy a lot of shares in home building companies. Specifically, the June quarter saw him scoop up shares of three construction firms. These are NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI). Berkshire Hathaway cumulatively invested $814 million in the companies during the quarter. Out of these, the biggest stake is in D. R. Horton, as the investment firm bought 5.9 million shares that were worth $726 million.Story continuesD. R. Horton is one of America's largest home building companies in terms of volume, and the current high rate environment that has sapped consumer budgets would lead one to believe that its shares should be down considerably year to date. However, when we look at the stock's year to date performance, we find out that D. R. Horton's shares are up by 29% year to date, in line with the 30% gains of the S&amp;P Homebuilders Select Industry Index during the same time period. The industry has also performed well this year in terms of earnings, and the reason behind this is an interesting one that isn't often talked about. Simply put, home builders benefited from the surge in demand from the low rate coronavirus environment, and as interest rates were jacked up, there were able to significantly reduce their prices and offer buyers mortgage rates as low as 5%. This clever adaptation to the market environment has translated into strong share price gains for home buildings stocks, with investment bank Deutsche Bank penning an optimistic note for the sector in June when it shared:With continued improvement in demand fundamentals and book valuations fairly attractive by historical standards, our view is that homebuilder stocks can climb meaningfully higher.That said, we also overlay an actionable, stock-specific theme, encouraging investors to favor builders with executives dedicated to systematically and programmatically improving returns on inventory, growing tangible book value per share, and letting multiples follow those fundamentals.. . .We expect solid demand for new housing to accompany a continuing normalization of margins and returns, and as book values grow, the stocks should generally move higher, but we see opportunity for stock selection.We looked to identify those builders with higher post-pandemic returns on inventory, who can also be reasonably expected to make solid capital allocation choices that consistently improve return on equity.Seems like Warren Buffett agrees with Deutsche Bank when it comes to his latest stock picks. Today, we'll look at other growth stocks in his portfolio. As a refresher, a growth stock is typically a company that is expected to grow its earnings in the future. This is reflected in its share price, which is significantly higher than the firm's earnings per share. Some top Warren Buffett growth stocks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Markel Group Inc. (NYSE:MKL), and StoneCo Ltd. (NASDAQ:STNE).Warren Buffett's 11 Growth Stock PicksOur Methodology To compile our list of Warren Buffett's growth stocks, we took a look at Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio for Q2 2023 and selected the stocks that have a price to trailing earnings ratio higher than 30.Warren Buffett's 11 Growth Stock Picks11.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the virtual reality industry which highlights key trends and major players, you can directly go to the 5 Best Virtual Reality Stocks to Invest In.Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that immerses users in a simulated digital environment, often through the use of specialized headsets and other sensory devices. The aim of VR is to create a sense of presence and interaction within a virtual world that can be visually and sometimes audibly or haptically experienced as if it were real. The technology crafts this engrossing encounter for users using devices like VR headsets, glasses, gloves, and bodysuits. Although virtual reality emerged in the 1990s, its true potential, promised three decades ago, is only now beginning to materialize. While VR currently finds its primary applications in gaming and entertainment, its capabilities hold significant promise across various sectors like engineering, design, healthcare, defense, and education. According to a report by Grand View Research, the worldwide market for virtual reality was valued at approximately $59.96 billion in 2022, with projections indicating a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.5% from 2023 to 2030.Currently, conventional VR setups employ VR headsets or multi-projected setups to generate lifelike sensations, mimicking a user's actual existence within a virtual world. This effect is predominantly achieved through VR headsets, which encompass head-mounted displays—enclosed headsets that prevent external light or real-world visuals from interfering with the virtual domain. Prominent providers of VR headsets encompass massive tech corporations like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), and naturally, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Enhancements in VR hardware, including the emergence of compact and stylish devices, are anticipated to bolster the wider acceptance of VR both among consumers and across various sectors. Healthcare, workforce training, and manufacturing are foreseen as some of the industries most profoundly influenced by VR's advancements. Instances of VR applications encompass training simulations for surgeons and production workers, as well as immersive educational encounters within classrooms. An example of such application includes Kansas City University's Center for Medical Education Innovation (CMEI), a teaching facility that allows medical students to learn how to evaluate, diagnose and treat patients in repetition with real-world simulation through the use of virtual reality and augmented reality (AR) technology.Story continuesFor now, the market is dominated by the gaming and entertainment sectors, where companies are making substantial investments in the creation of content, software, and hardware tailored for gaming applications. The increasing appeal of virtual theme parks, museums, and arcades contributes significantly to the expansion of this segment. The initial endeavors to integrate VR into video games can be traced back all the way back to the 1980s, with prominent examples like Nintendo's Virtual Boy and Matter, Inc.'s Power Glove. However, it wasn't until 2013 that VR gaming truly gained momentum, catalyzed by the introduction of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s Oculus Rift, which marked the advent of the first consumer-ready VR product. As a testament to its growth, the valuation of the VR gaming market was approximated at $6.26 billion in 2020. Projections indicate that this market is poised to expand to $53.44 billion by 2028, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate exceeding 30%.Overall, this industry is poised to grow with more companies planning to get involved. Companies like Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are among the many that are making strides in the space and could be at the forefront of the massive opportunity that virtual reality and augmented reality present.

The upcoming platform will also make use of Qualcomm's Snapdragon Spaces XR developer environment, founded on the OpenXR standards and rapidly embraced by a wide-ranging ecosystem, encompassing AR and VR system original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Honor, Motorola, Nubia, OnePlus, Oppo, RedMagic, Sharp, Vivo, Xiaomi, and ZTE.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 73 hedge funds were bullish on QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM, compared to 69 funds in the earlier quarter.Madison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock was volatile during the quarter but moved higher in March. Qualcomm fundamentals have been hurt over the last several quarters due to excess smartphone inventories. Management messaged in their recent conference call that inventory issues peaked in their first fiscal quarter and should begin to moderate. They are also seeing excess inventory in their IoT (Internet of Things) business, which will take a couple of quarters to work through. By our estimates, Qualcomm fundamentals should trough in the June quarter with a second-half recovery. Qualcomm remains well positioned to diversify away from smartphones with long-term growth in Auto and IoT.”6. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is among what are considered to be the great technology companies, like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel, that one is apt to see some of the greatest confusion between short-term financial results and share price movements, on the one hand, and long-term financial results. The former are exceedingly difficult to predict. Long term results are relatively easy to predict, because they are bound by the limiting realities of the business model. In the case of AMD, that is the business of being a large-scale semi-conductor manufacturer with a more dominant competitor that has a scale economy advantage.Here’s what people see, remember and act upon.

If you want to skip out on our introduction to the famous hedge fund investor and the latest news about him, then head on over to Michael Burry's Top 5 Stock Picks For Q3. Few hedge fund owners have had movies made about them, and perhaps even fewer have predicted the Great Recession of 2008. Michael Burry, the hedge fund boss who ran Scion Capital back in 2008, has seen both, and he currently runs the private investment firm Scion Capital Group, LLC.Dr. Burry is one of the rare hedge fund investors in the industry who is not a Ph.D. doctor. Instead, he is a Doctor of Medicine, through a degree that he earned from the University of California, Los Angeles. He is also another rare hedge fund boss who is still licensed to practice medicine, as he regularly keeps up with the educational requirements needed to maintain the ability to practice medicine in the United States.In case you're unaware, Dr. Burry rose to prominence in the financial world when he correctly predicted that the real estate market in America would crash by 2007. His hypothesis was based on the fact that subprime mortgages, which are loans made to borrowers with low FICO scores, would rapidly drop in value once their teaser rates were replaced by higher rates. Since these loans formed the basis of financial assets such as mortgage backed securities, the broader implications of the subprime borrowers being unable to make their loan payments in the finance industry would be severe. Subsequently, Dr. Burry shorted the subprime market and proved his detractors wrong when he netted nearly a billion dollars in profit during a time when wealthy and regular Americans witnessed large wipeouts in their assets.However, since then, several of his predictions have proven to be wrong. One of Dr. Burry's most famous short positions has been against the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). He posted on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) in December 2020 that he was short on Tesla and advised the firm's chief Mr. Elon Musk that he should take advantage of the high share price back then to raise capital by issuing more shares. Adjusting for all stock splits to date, Tesla's shares were worth $235 as 2020 ended (they were trading above $550 before the splits when Burry made the bearish remarks), and since then, they gained nearly 81% in value to touch $407 in just 11 months. Currently, Tesla is trading around $225, having lost only $10 since Dr. Burry revealed his position.Story continuesGoing against Tesla isn't the only thing that Dr. Burry's been up to since the housing market crash before the Great Recession. One of his latest predictions came in January when he outlined on X:Inflation peaked. But it is not the last peak of this cycle. We are likely to see CPI lower, possibly negative in 2H 2023, and the US in recession by any definition.Fed will cut and government will stimulate. And we will have another inflation spike. It's not hard.Since then, the U.S. economy has grown during the second quarter, inflation has consistently fallen, and the Federal Reserve continues to hike interest rates. In fact, the Fed's potential decisions have created some unease among investors, who are uncertain whether robust economic data provides the central bank with more leeway to increase interest rates. At the same time, banks such as Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have either reduced their odds of a recession or scrapped the forecasts completely.With the second quarter hedge fund filing season upon us, Dr. Burry's private investment firm Scion Asset Management also filed its 13-F report with the SEC. This report created ripples in the market and the media as it revealed two massive bearish bets against the stock market. These are the largest bets in his portfolio, and cumulatively, they represent nearly 94% of Michael Burry's latest holdings. In investing, there are derivatives that are called options. They are of two kinds, namely a Put and a Call. Among these, a Put option is a bearish bet since it provides an investor with the opportunity to sell the shares at a predetermined price called the strike price. So, if the underlying security is trading at a price lower than the strike price, the investor profits by buying the security at the lower price and then selling it at a higher price.Dr. Burry's investment portfolio shows that he has bought a stunning $1.6 billion worth of Put options. One of these is for an index fund that tracks the NASDAQ 100 and and the other is for the S&amp;P 500. Seems like the Big Short investor is really going all in when it comes to betting against the market, and only time can tell whether he succeeds or not.While we wait to see how Michael Burry's bet against the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ 100 plays out, here's a list of his top stock picks during this year's second quarter. Some notable names are Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR), Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC), and Expedia Group, Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis of generative AI and its application in the field of investing, you can go directly to see the 5 Stocks ChatGPT Said Will Make Me Rich in 10 Years.Using Artificial Intelligence To InvestThe markets have been talking about artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, all year. Companies across a wide range of industries and sectors are attempting to introduce their own AI-driven products and services so as not to be left in the dust by their competitors. At the same time, every investor is trying to get into the artificial intelligence trade today. Individual investors and hedge funds alike are putting their manpower into picking out the best AI stocks for the rest of the year as we head into the second half of 2023. Interestingly enough, at this point, it's not just manpower that's going into picking stocks. Some investors and hedge funds are actually trying to harness the power of AI to pick stocks instead of leaving the job to human beings. This trend really gets you thinking about how successful an AI software might be at helping an investor build up their portfolio. Is it a strategy that might lead to mind-blowing results or one that will lead you to ruin?On August 3, CNBC invited Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, to talk about just this. CNBC's Bob Pisani noted that AI-driven exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been around for a while and are starting to come up more this year. Pisani thus invited Rosenbluth to share some of his insights on these ETFs and how effective they are. According to Rosenbluth, a lot more AI-driven ETFs have been working on picking stocks recently. Here's what he had to say about this development:""It's perhaps a smarter way of picking stocks. I know that computers can be smarter than I know I am, [it's] whether or not they're going to be better at outperforming the broader S&amp;P 500. There's no emotion behind it.""Story continuesIs Generative AI Really Helpful For Investors?The discussion surrounding artificial intelligence, in general, and in the world of investing, has been extremely interesting because of the immense potential of this technology when it comes to changing the way people live, work, and even invest. It makes you wonder how not only AI-driven ETFs but also AI chatbots can contribute to the investing world today. This May, CNN reported that a dummy portfolio of 38 stocks recommended by OpenAI's viral chatbot, ChatGPT, actually managed to outperform major investment funds in the United Kingdom, for instance. This portfolio managed to gain about 4.9% between March 6 and April 28, while the 10 leading investment funds of the country reported an average loss of about 0.8%. During the same period, the S&amp;P 500 rose by 3%. The result of this experiment is merely one example of the sheer potential vested in artificial intelligence when it comes to investing.Our Stock-Picking Experiment with ChatGPTConsidering these developments, we also attempted to get a list of stocks from ChatGPT this March. We first prompted the AI chatbot to present itself as a professional investment advisor and then asked it to present a list of 10 stocks it thinks will make us rich in the next 10 years. ChatGPT then proceeded to give us a diversified list of stocks, ranging from tech names and consumer staples to financials and healthcare. Some of the most notable names on its list included Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), all big names in the tech and AI sectors this year.Today we will be revisiting this list of stocks to see how each of these companies has performed over the period between March and August and check if ChatGPT really was right in recommending these names. By doing this, we will see if these really can be considered stocks that will make you rich in 2023 and beyond.10 Stocks ChatGPT Said Will Make Me Rich in 10 YearsOur MethodologyIn March 2023 we asked ChatGPT to act like an expert stock picker and recommend some stocks that could make us rich in 10 years. To be specific, we asked the chatbot, ""Which stocks will make me rich in 10 years?"" In this article, we calculated the returns of these stocks from the date of our previous article's publication, March 16, to August 16. We then ranked these stocks based on these calculated returns, from the lowest to the highest.

If you want to skip our introduction to the investor and growth investing, then head on to Warren Buffett's 5 Growth Stock Picks. Warren Buffett is one of the most successful investors of our time. His investment strategy depends on identifying firms with solid business models that are primed for growth and market capture to profit from the resulting boost to the share price. He also has one of the largest non-bank investment portfolios in the stock market, with our research suggesting that Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio by the end of this year's second quarter was worth a whopping $348 billion. The investments in the portfolio are not evenly spread out, since Berkshire's biggest stake is in the Cupertino, California consumer technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). This stake is worth an unbelievable $177 billion and accounts for 51% of Mr. Buffett's overall holdings.However, while he might be absolutely sure about the future prospects of Apple, a firm that also pays a 24 cent dividend for a 0.55% yield, the second quarter saw Mr. Buffett take a bullish stance on a different sector. The Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes this year have pummeled a lot of sectors, and one of the hardest hit among these has been the real estate industry. Within real estate, office companies have been hit particularly hard since not only have the high rates made it difficult for firms to raise capital and make payments on existing loans, but the trend towards remote working has also left office property owners scratching their heads. For more details, check out 15 Worst Performing REITs in 2023.While Mr. Buffett kept away from the office real estate sector, he did buy a lot of shares in home building companies. Specifically, the June quarter saw him scoop up shares of three construction firms. These are NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI). Berkshire Hathaway cumulatively invested $814 million in the companies during the quarter. Out of these, the biggest stake is in D. R. Horton, as the investment firm bought 5.9 million shares that were worth $726 million.Story continuesD. R. Horton is one of America's largest home building companies in terms of volume, and the current high rate environment that has sapped consumer budgets would lead one to believe that its shares should be down considerably year to date. However, when we look at the stock's year to date performance, we find out that D. R. Horton's shares are up by 29% year to date, in line with the 30% gains of the S&amp;P Homebuilders Select Industry Index during the same time period. The industry has also performed well this year in terms of earnings, and the reason behind this is an interesting one that isn't often talked about. Simply put, home builders benefited from the surge in demand from the low rate coronavirus environment, and as interest rates were jacked up, there were able to significantly reduce their prices and offer buyers mortgage rates as low as 5%. This clever adaptation to the market environment has translated into strong share price gains for home buildings stocks, with investment bank Deutsche Bank penning an optimistic note for the sector in June when it shared:With continued improvement in demand fundamentals and book valuations fairly attractive by historical standards, our view is that homebuilder stocks can climb meaningfully higher.That said, we also overlay an actionable, stock-specific theme, encouraging investors to favor builders with executives dedicated to systematically and programmatically improving returns on inventory, growing tangible book value per share, and letting multiples follow those fundamentals.. . .We expect solid demand for new housing to accompany a continuing normalization of margins and returns, and as book values grow, the stocks should generally move higher, but we see opportunity for stock selection.We looked to identify those builders with higher post-pandemic returns on inventory, who can also be reasonably expected to make solid capital allocation choices that consistently improve return on equity.Seems like Warren Buffett agrees with Deutsche Bank when it comes to his latest stock picks. Today, we'll look at other growth stocks in his portfolio. As a refresher, a growth stock is typically a company that is expected to grow its earnings in the future. This is reflected in its share price, which is significantly higher than the firm's earnings per share. Some top Warren Buffett growth stocks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Markel Group Inc. (NYSE:MKL), and StoneCo Ltd. (NASDAQ:STNE).Warren Buffett's 11 Growth Stock PicksOur Methodology To compile our list of Warren Buffett's growth stocks, we took a look at Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio for Q2 2023 and selected the stocks that have a price to trailing earnings ratio higher than 30.Warren Buffett's 11 Growth Stock Picks11.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Johnson &amp; Johnson's shares before the 25th of August in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 7th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.19 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$4.64 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Johnson &amp; Johnson stock has a trailing yield of around 2.8% on the current share price of $172.49. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.  Check out our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson  Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Johnson &amp; Johnson paid out 92% of its earnings, which is more than we're comfortable with, unless there are mitigating circumstances. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out 82% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth.Story continuesIt's good to see that while Johnson &amp; Johnson's dividends were not well covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective. Still, if this were to happen repeatedly, we'd be concerned about whether the dividend is sustainable in a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see Johnson &amp; Johnson has grown its earnings rapidly, up 60% a year for the past five years.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Johnson &amp; Johnson has increased its dividend at approximately 6.9% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Johnson &amp; Johnson for the upcoming dividend? Johnson &amp; Johnson has been growing its earnings per share nicely, although judging by the difference between its profit and cashflow payout ratios, the company might have reported some write-offs over the last year. Overall, it's hard to get excited about Johnson &amp; Johnson from a dividend perspective.So if you want to do more digging on Johnson &amp; Johnson, you'll find it worthwhile knowing the risks that this stock faces. For example - Johnson &amp; Johnson has  4 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend  checking our selection of top dividend stocks.

63,f056fa4f-ddb5-37d3-853a-7d21470c3398,MDT,2023-08-21,Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) Has Announced A Dividend Of $0.69,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-nyse-mdt-announced-dividend-100357525.html,1692612237,STORY,['MDT'],"[The board of Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 13th of October, with investors receiving $0.69 per share. This makes the dividend yield 3.4%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. See our latest analysis for Medtronic Medtronic's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 96% of what it was earning and 80% of cash flows. This indicates that the company could be more focused on returning cash to shareholders than reinvesting to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 56.7%. Assuming the dividend continues along the course it has been charting recently, our estimates show the payout ratio being 68% which brings it into quite a comfortable range.historic-dividendMedtronic Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.04 total annually to $2.76. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 10% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. However, Medtronic has only grown its earnings per share at 4.3% per annum over the past five years. So the company has struggled to grow its EPS yet it's still paying out 96% of its earnings. As they say in finance, 'past performance is not indicative of future performance', but we are not confident a company with limited earnings growth and a high payout ratio will be a star dividend-payer over the next decade.Story continuesMedtronic's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. As an example, we've identified 1 warning sign for Medtronic that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

64,a2989796-4d92-3b50-8d31-d7cf2f57be1f,MDT,2023-08-21,10 Stocks That Will Change the Future,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-stocks-change-future-201448931.html,1692562488,STORY,"['NVDA', 'MSFT', 'ROK', 'ABB.BO', 'MBLY', 'INMD', 'MDT']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at 10 stocks that will change the future. To skip our detailed analysis of how the market is transforming this year, you can go directly to see the 5 Stocks That Will Change the Future.Technological AdvancementsFrom the start of the year, we have been hearing about how new technology, artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation are some of the things that will significantly transform the world as we know it. Those who are skeptical about the impact of new technologies hold that such assertions are mere exaggerations. However, others are more inclined to believe that we may currently be in the midst of a new tech revolution. With the rise of new technologies, everything is beginning to change, ranging from how you interact with other people and live day-to-day to how you work and go about your professional life. Because new technological advancements are rapidly taking over the world, many companies are incorporating new tech and artificial intelligence in their operations, while those that have been operating in this space since their inception are continuing to get ahead.An example of one such company is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a semiconductor company that has been the talk of the town since the start of the year because of its stellar work in the artificial intelligence field. The company offers AI chips that have become increasingly popular among its customers and investors alike. Building on its momentum, on August 8, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also announced its release of an updated AI processor that is even more efficient than its earlier products. This move is being considered an attempt by the company to retain its dominance in the AI chips space. The new processor is called the Grace Hopper Superchip, and it is a combination graphics chip and processor. This is the world's first HBM3e processor and is designed specifically for the ""era of accelerated computing and generative AI."" The new chip is expected to be 50% faster than the company's current HBM3 processors, making it well-positioned to handle complex generative AI workloads. According to NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) report, the chip will begin to be produced in the second quarter of 2024.Story continuesInvestments In New TechThe creation of products like the Grace Hopper Superchip highlights how tech companies today are embracing the way new developments in their field are changing consumer expectations. This is also leading to companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) now working on meeting these changing expectations to offer faster, more efficient, and more cutting-edge technologies. At the same time, other major companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are doing their part in this area by developing their own technologies while investing in other companies that are steadily becoming leaders in this space. For instance, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) made an early move in generative AI with a $1 billion investment in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, in 2019. While this investment did not garner much attention at the time it was made, with the virality of ChatGPT today, both OpenAI and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have come under the spotlight. By this April, the latter's investment in the former was estimated to be about $13 billion, according to CNBC. This immense investment has also given the big tech giant an edge over other tech companies investing in AI since it now has access to OpenAI's generative AI technology, which it has steadily been incorporating into its own Bing search engine. The same technology has also been integrated into other Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) offerings, such as its sales and marketing software and the Azure cloud.With the way companies like these are rapidly incorporating new technologies into their products and services, it is highly likely that before long, the technology sector, along with several others, will become absolutely unrecognizable, exponentially faster, and immensely more efficient. Even healthcare companies like Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) are integrating artificial intelligence into their products. For example, the Medtronic Touch Surgery Enterprise is the first AI-powered surgical video management and analytics platform for operating rooms globally. At the same time, tech startups and companies are bringing highly innovative products and technologies to the table. DeepMind is one example of an AI company that has been working to combine machine learning and systems neuroscience to build learning algorithms. The company's AI system uses raw pixels as data input in its deep learning process, online other AI systems which are pre-programmed. DeepMind's success in the AI field and its ability to make innovative and different products in the area resulted in its acquisition by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in 2014.Another interesting private company is Numenta, which has been developing powerful neuroscience-based AI solutions. The company leverages the structures and efficiencies found in the brain to accelerate deep learning networks and make advanced AI systems. Numenta's work, if carried on as it is right now, may result in the creation of an AI system that functions similarly to the human brain, more so than any other AI system does today. These are just a few examples of how we are currently seeing the world change, but they are enough to highlight the fact that today there are many companies that are working hard to become part of a tech-oriented future. Considering the above, we have compiled a list of some stocks that will change the future for the long term based on their current operations. Many of these companies may even be considered some of the best growth stocks for the next five years.10 Stocks That Will Change the FuturePhoto by Maximalfocus on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe used a consensus opinion-based approach to find stocks that most sources online think will change the future.

To skip our detailed analysis of how the market is transforming this year, you can go directly to see the 5 Stocks That Will Change the Future.Technological AdvancementsFrom the start of the year, we have been hearing about how new technology, artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation are some of the things that will significantly transform the world as we know it. Those who are skeptical about the impact of new technologies hold that such assertions are mere exaggerations. However, others are more inclined to believe that we may currently be in the midst of a new tech revolution. With the rise of new technologies, everything is beginning to change, ranging from how you interact with other people and live day-to-day to how you work and go about your professional life. Because new technological advancements are rapidly taking over the world, many companies are incorporating new tech and artificial intelligence in their operations, while those that have been operating in this space since their inception are continuing to get ahead.An example of one such company is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a semiconductor company that has been the talk of the town since the start of the year because of its stellar work in the artificial intelligence field. The company offers AI chips that have become increasingly popular among its customers and investors alike. Building on its momentum, on August 8, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also announced its release of an updated AI processor that is even more efficient than its earlier products. This move is being considered an attempt by the company to retain its dominance in the AI chips space. The new processor is called the Grace Hopper Superchip, and it is a combination graphics chip and processor. This is the world's first HBM3e processor and is designed specifically for the ""era of accelerated computing and generative AI."" The new chip is expected to be 50% faster than the company's current HBM3 processors, making it well-positioned to handle complex generative AI workloads. According to NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) report, the chip will begin to be produced in the second quarter of 2024.Story continuesInvestments In New TechThe creation of products like the Grace Hopper Superchip highlights how tech companies today are embracing the way new developments in their field are changing consumer expectations. This is also leading to companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) now working on meeting these changing expectations to offer faster, more efficient, and more cutting-edge technologies. At the same time, other major companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are doing their part in this area by developing their own technologies while investing in other companies that are steadily becoming leaders in this space. For instance, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) made an early move in generative AI with a $1 billion investment in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, in 2019. While this investment did not garner much attention at the time it was made, with the virality of ChatGPT today, both OpenAI and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have come under the spotlight. By this April, the latter's investment in the former was estimated to be about $13 billion, according to CNBC. This immense investment has also given the big tech giant an edge over other tech companies investing in AI since it now has access to OpenAI's generative AI technology, which it has steadily been incorporating into its own Bing search engine. The same technology has also been integrated into other Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) offerings, such as its sales and marketing software and the Azure cloud.With the way companies like these are rapidly incorporating new technologies into their products and services, it is highly likely that before long, the technology sector, along with several others, will become absolutely unrecognizable, exponentially faster, and immensely more efficient. Even healthcare companies like Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) are integrating artificial intelligence into their products. For example, the Medtronic Touch Surgery Enterprise is the first AI-powered surgical video management and analytics platform for operating rooms globally. At the same time, tech startups and companies are bringing highly innovative products and technologies to the table. DeepMind is one example of an AI company that has been working to combine machine learning and systems neuroscience to build learning algorithms. The company's AI system uses raw pixels as data input in its deep learning process, online other AI systems which are pre-programmed. DeepMind's success in the AI field and its ability to make innovative and different products in the area resulted in its acquisition by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in 2014.Another interesting private company is Numenta, which has been developing powerful neuroscience-based AI solutions. The company leverages the structures and efficiencies found in the brain to accelerate deep learning networks and make advanced AI systems. Numenta's work, if carried on as it is right now, may result in the creation of an AI system that functions similarly to the human brain, more so than any other AI system does today. These are just a few examples of how we are currently seeing the world change, but they are enough to highlight the fact that today there are many companies that are working hard to become part of a tech-oriented future. Considering the above, we have compiled a list of some stocks that will change the future for the long term based on their current operations. Many of these companies may even be considered some of the best growth stocks for the next five years.10 Stocks That Will Change the FuturePhoto by Maximalfocus on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe used a consensus opinion-based approach to find stocks that most sources online think will change the future.

(NYSE:ROK) Suggests It's 33% Undervalued",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-rockwell-automation-inc-135928531.html,1692539968,STORY,['ROK'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Rockwell Automation is US$435 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityRockwell Automation's US$292 share price signals that it might be 33% undervalued The US$313 analyst price target for ROK is 28% less than our estimate of fair valueDoes the August share price for Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.54bUS$1.66bUS$1.93bUS$2.62bUS$2.97bUS$3.27bUS$3.52bUS$3.73bUS$3.91bUS$4.06bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x13Analyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 13.33%Est @ 9.97%Est @ 7.63%Est @ 5.98%Est @ 4.83%Est @ 4.03% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.5kUS$1.9kUS$2.0kUS$2.0kUS$2.0kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.1b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.2%) = US$69bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$69b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$32bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$50b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$292, the company appears quite good value at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Rockwell Automation as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.195. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Rockwell AutomationStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electrical market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Policymakers are more familiar with stablecoins, crypto tokens typically pegged to a fiat currency, than they were in 2019. A push to create federal stablecoin regulations has also helped boost their legitimacy in the eyes of lawmakers.""The world has changed dramatically since Facebook's Libra project. There was no familiarity with stablecoins whatsoever,"" said Christopher Giancarlo, former chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.""Since then the administration, Congress and the Federal Reserve have had time to get their minds around stablecoins and stablecoin regulation and there has been very extensive public relations by the industry, including a lot of lobbying.”In contrast to Facebook, a social media giant that had been under sustained scrutiny over privacy issues and Russian election interference, PayPal is an established financial operator in Washington. It spent $1.13 million on federal lobbying last year, according to OpenSecrets, and has been lobbying on cryptocurrencies for several years, records show.""From a policy perspective, there is a seismic difference between Facebook's Libra and PayPal's stablecoin,"" said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research for brokerage BTIG.Story continues""There is still a wall between banking and commerce, so knowing that PayPal is very clearly on one side of that wall should assuage lawmakers.""PayPal and Meta declined to comment.PayPal USD will be issued by digital trust company Paxos Trust, backed by dollar deposits and U.S Treasuries, and subject to oversight by the New York State Department of Financial Services.PayPal launched a stablecoin because it sees itself as a leader in payments innovation, said one person familiar with the plan, and CEO Dan Schulman has said he envisages it will eventually be used for payments. But PayPal expects the stablecoin will mostly be used by U.S. customers to buy and sell other crypto tokens on its platform, the source said.Dan Dolev, a senior analyst at Mizuho, said PayPal USD is not a game-changer for PayPal investors. ""It's positive noise,"" he added.GRAND AMBITIONSTo be sure, some policymakers have concerns. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services committee, expressed alarm that PayPal is launching a stablecoin without federal oversight to protect consumers and financial stability. But mostly the reaction in Washington has been muted.When Facebook unveiled Libra, a stablecoin whose operations were based in Switzerland and which was pegged to a basket of currencies, executives made no secret of their ambitions. They said they wanted to revolutionize the global financial system.The project ran in to fierce opposition from policymakers alarmed that Libra could give Facebook too much control over the money system, and infringe on users' privacy. Caught by surprise, regulators were confused about who should oversee stablecoins.Facebook rebranded Libra, scaled it back and moved the project to the United States, in a bid to win U.S. regulatory approval.According to one former official with direct knowledge of the matter, the decision on approving Libra coincided with the transition to President Joe Biden's administration in January 2021. While the Fed had been working on the issue for some time, the decision ultimately fell to the new Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. She wanted time to fully analyze the issues, this person said.Tired of waiting, Facebook sold the venture in January 2022.The White House and the Fed declined to comment. A Treasury spokesperson noted that Yellen has ""repeatedly called on Congress to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins.""The Treasury has studied stablecoins over the past two years. After TerraUSD collapsed last year, Yellen said stablecoins did not pose systemic risks. Since then, fears that stablecoins could supplant traditional money have subsided, and the Treasury and Congress have broadly agreed that prudential regulators should oversee them.""There's been an awful lot of work done ... to understand what the proportional risk of these things is,"" said Jack Fletcher, head of policy and government relations at blockchain company R3.The Fed this month outlined the process for state banks to transact in stablecoins, while the House Financial Services committee last month advanced a bill giving the Fed more power to oversee stablecoins while preserving state regulators' authority.The committee's Republican chair, Patrick McHenry, said in a statement on PayPal USD that Congress should move fast to pass that bill, ""enabling stablecoins to achieve their full potential.""(Reporting by Hannah Lang in Washington; Additional reporting by Andrea Shalal and Pete Schroeder in Washington, and Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Editing by Michelle Price and Matthew Lewis)]"

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the stock market performance in 2023, head directly to 5 Best Affordable Stocks Under $30. According to BlackRock, the stock market has performed better than the initial estimates for the year. Previously, investors had expressed concerns about the market performance in 2023. However, so far, the equity market has fought off banking pressures, a risk for recession, and the Federal Reserve’s restrictive monetary policy and outperformed estimations. Recently, the tech industry has been the star of the show. With AI-based innovation leading the tech industry, the market has exhibited strong returns. This was further aided by the Federal Reserve’s efforts to normalize inflation during the year. Altogether, experts see the market moving towards a ‘soft-landing’, whereby growth stabilizes and inflation is maintained close to the targeted rate. Similar to the time between 2015 and 2019, this calls for a preference for growth, with technology and consumer discretionary stocks being the star performers. All this has led to an increase in the S&amp;P 500 index gaining close to 16% and the NASDAQ Composite to increase by nearly 30% year-to-date as of August 18. However, despite the performance so far, the economy gives off mixed signals for the future. Also Read: 11 Cheap Bank Stocks To Buy Before They Take OffWhile the initial estimates for the probability of a recession this year have certainly improved, according to the Federal Reserve, their model still calculates a 71% chance for a recession by May 2024, which is the highest since 1982. Despite this, consumer spending and the performance of the labor market continues to be promising. The government’s efforts to counter the inflationary pressure is one of the leading factors for a better performance in the equity market. In 2022, the consumer price index had surged to 9.1%. Although the Federal Reserve hopes to achieve a long-term target of 2%, it was successful in bringing it as low as 3% by June this year. Story continuesIn 2022, Michael Gapen, the chief U.S. economist at Bank of America, expected unemployment and inflation rates to induce a mild recession by 2023. However, as the unemployment rate was reported at just 3.5% in July this year, Mr. Gapen had this to say about the new incoming data about the United States economy:""We revise our outlook in favor of a 'soft landing' where growth falls below trend in 2024, but remains positive throughout.""Don't Miss: 11 Cheap Gold Stocks To Buy According to AnalystsAnother major contributor for the market performance has been consumer spending. Given the increased cost of borrowing and the rates of unemployment that were expected initially, consumer spending was forecasted to tighten. During unemployment, households tend to save more. However, with the labor market performing better than estimates, consumer spending is on the rise. In fact, the consumer discretionary sector has reported the highest earnings growth in the second quarter, with the earnings per share rising by about 36% from the previous year. Although the market has exhibited resilience against the recessionary pressure, many investors still appear to have taken a rather cynical approach to the future. Brian Moynihan, the CEO for Bank of America, believes that a recession might be inevitable during the next year. Similarly, Vanguard economists reported that the market performance this year has, in essence, delayed the inevitable recession to the next year. In line with this, JPMorgan Chase expects a global slow-down by 2024. In contrast, investor sentiment seems to remain strong. Seemingly, the risk appetite appears to be rising as well, as the Russell 2000 Index, which focuses on small cap stocks, is up by roughly 7% this year. While the current market performance can be a motivator for beginner investors to consider investing in stocks, the recessionary pressures are forecasted to only strengthen. Ergo, investors looking to minimize risk by investing in affordable stocks can check our list of picks, which includes Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), Pinterest, Inc.

(NYSE:T), The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is one of the best affordable stocks under $30. Massif Capital had this to say about The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Currently, the portfolio has roughly 11% allocated across two utilities, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) and Polaris Renewable Energy. In the case of both equities, we have experienced disappointing 2023 market results, and in the case of AES, it is the long-book’s worst performer YTD, dragging down the overall portfolio by -2.09%. Polaris contributed a positive return of 0.21%. These two positions represent investments in similar assets but very different businesses, which explains much of the divergence in this year’s results.In the case of AES, we have a heavily US-focused utility with significant exposure to regulated and unregulated markets and a significant commitment to building out renewable energy. The firm also has some exposure to electricity markets in South America and exposure to electricity storage markets in the form of its ownership stake in Fluence (FLNC). Despite being one of the larger US utilities, the firm has trailed the sector (as measured by the IXUTR Index) dramatically this year…” (Click here to read the full text)11.

Overall natural gas storage inventories recently have reached slightly elevated levels, due largely to the milder than average winter experienced across the globe. This dynamic has weighed on benchmark natural gas prices, and in turn has pressured Antero’s stock. Despite these current headwinds, we believe the company’s relatively low-cost operations, strong balance sheet, positive recent productivity trends, and ability to price its production at a premium to benchmark prices should position it well to weather the current choppy environment until the country’s liquified natural gas export capacity increases over the next several years.”10.

Clarivate goes to market with a collection of well-known brands, including Web of Science, ProQuest One, Alma, Cortellis, Derwent, and CompuMark.Clarivate has an attractive business model.

ZoomInfo is a leading provider of contact databases and associated marketing automation tools for business-to-business sellers. Our thesis was that the company’s combination of data, insights and digital tools was being well received by companies looking to increase sales force productivity and enhance the returns on their substantial customer relationship management (CRM) software investments. However, we have grown increasingly skeptical about the durability of its top-line growth in a challenging economic environment as customers potentially look to cut costs and the company is unproven in a downturn. Given these concerns, we decided to harvest the position.”8.

An underweight to communication services and an overweight to energy helped performance, while an underweight to consumer staples and an overweight to materials detracted. Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.”7. The Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Share Price as of August 18: $23.80Next on our list of the best affordable stocks is The Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMK), which is an entertainment company that operates podcasts, music, sports, weather, traffic, and infotainment channels.

Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) delivered a modestly positive return in the second quarter, while The Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMA) rebounded sharply, likely due to its upcoming recapitalization. In August, Liberty SiriusXM will move its 30% stake in concert promotion and ticketing firm Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (LYV) to a new tracking stock (Liberty Live Group), leaving Liberty SiriusXM shares as a “pure play” tracker of its 82% ownership of satellite radio provider SiriusXM Holdings, Inc. (SIRI). We intend to own both trackers upon receipt, and we believe the clearer structure may lead investors to reduce the current, large mark-to-market discount between Liberty SiriusXM and its underlying SiriusXM shares.”6. Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Share Price as of August 18: $27.23Ally Financial Inc.

(NYSE:PINS), and AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) is one of the best affordable stocks under $30. Silver Beech Capital had this to say about Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) is the largest all-digital bank in the United States, the 22nd largest bank by total assets ($192 billion), the nation’s leading prime auto lender (with 6.5 million consumer customers), and leading auto floor plan lender (with over 23,000 dealer relationships). Most of Ally’s assets are auto loans and finance receivables, but Ally also offers consumer protection insurance through its dealer channels and operates small corporate and mortgage lending businesses. Notably, Ally also offers some of the industry’s most competitive deposit products: Ally was awarded “Best Checking Account”, “Best Saving Account”, and overall “Best Online Bank” by third party reviews and was the first large bank to eliminate overdraft fees. We believe Ally’s intrinsic value is more than 40% greater than its March 31 share price.Ally evolved from the auto finance unit of GMAC, emerged from GMAC’s restructuring as a bank holding company and rebranded, before going public in 2014. Since then, Ally has transformed itself from a wholesale-funded, captive finance company into a full-service retail-funded automotive finance and insurance provider by steadily gaining retail deposit market share. Today, Ally’s balance sheet is 85% funded (versus 43% funded in 2014) by $152 billion of deposits (versus $58 billion in 2014) across 4.4 million depositors (versus 900k depositors in 2014). Over 90% of Ally’s deposits are FDIC insured, more than any other $100+ billion asset bank in the United States. Ally’s massive insured deposit base is stickier and more resilient to depositor fear of a bank run than other regional banks…”(Click here to read the full text)   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Affordable Stocks Under $30.  Suggested articles:Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks10 Korean Stocks Listed in the U.S.Bill Gates Stock Portfolio: August 2023 Update Disclosure: None. 12 Best Affordable Stocks Under $30 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

""They've gained those loyal customers because of groceries, and now that's converting into them extending themselves and buying general merchandise.""Foot traffic increased at Walmart in the most recent quarter, up 2.8%. Target saw foot traffic drop by 4.8%.And once shoppers are in the store, they're buying more at Walmart too.Walmart's average ticket size rose by 3.4% while Target's edged lower by 0.7%. Overall, Walmart US saw same-store sales grow by 6.4% year over year last quarter as Target saw net sales decline by 4.9%.The two retailers differ in a number of important ways, such as their size, business segments, and customer base, Bernstein analyst Dean Rosenblum emphasized to Yahoo Finance.

To skip our detailed analysis of generative AI and its application in the field of investing, you can go directly to see the 5 Stocks ChatGPT Said Will Make Me Rich in 10 Years.Using Artificial Intelligence To InvestThe markets have been talking about artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, all year. Companies across a wide range of industries and sectors are attempting to introduce their own AI-driven products and services so as not to be left in the dust by their competitors. At the same time, every investor is trying to get into the artificial intelligence trade today. Individual investors and hedge funds alike are putting their manpower into picking out the best AI stocks for the rest of the year as we head into the second half of 2023. Interestingly enough, at this point, it's not just manpower that's going into picking stocks. Some investors and hedge funds are actually trying to harness the power of AI to pick stocks instead of leaving the job to human beings. This trend really gets you thinking about how successful an AI software might be at helping an investor build up their portfolio. Is it a strategy that might lead to mind-blowing results or one that will lead you to ruin?On August 3, CNBC invited Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, to talk about just this. CNBC's Bob Pisani noted that AI-driven exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been around for a while and are starting to come up more this year. Pisani thus invited Rosenbluth to share some of his insights on these ETFs and how effective they are. According to Rosenbluth, a lot more AI-driven ETFs have been working on picking stocks recently. Here's what he had to say about this development:""It's perhaps a smarter way of picking stocks. I know that computers can be smarter than I know I am, [it's] whether or not they're going to be better at outperforming the broader S&amp;P 500. There's no emotion behind it.""Story continuesIs Generative AI Really Helpful For Investors?The discussion surrounding artificial intelligence, in general, and in the world of investing, has been extremely interesting because of the immense potential of this technology when it comes to changing the way people live, work, and even invest. It makes you wonder how not only AI-driven ETFs but also AI chatbots can contribute to the investing world today. This May, CNN reported that a dummy portfolio of 38 stocks recommended by OpenAI's viral chatbot, ChatGPT, actually managed to outperform major investment funds in the United Kingdom, for instance. This portfolio managed to gain about 4.9% between March 6 and April 28, while the 10 leading investment funds of the country reported an average loss of about 0.8%. During the same period, the S&amp;P 500 rose by 3%. The result of this experiment is merely one example of the sheer potential vested in artificial intelligence when it comes to investing.Our Stock-Picking Experiment with ChatGPTConsidering these developments, we also attempted to get a list of stocks from ChatGPT this March. We first prompted the AI chatbot to present itself as a professional investment advisor and then asked it to present a list of 10 stocks it thinks will make us rich in the next 10 years. ChatGPT then proceeded to give us a diversified list of stocks, ranging from tech names and consumer staples to financials and healthcare. Some of the most notable names on its list included Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), all big names in the tech and AI sectors this year.Today we will be revisiting this list of stocks to see how each of these companies has performed over the period between March and August and check if ChatGPT really was right in recommending these names. By doing this, we will see if these really can be considered stocks that will make you rich in 2023 and beyond.10 Stocks ChatGPT Said Will Make Me Rich in 10 YearsOur MethodologyIn March 2023 we asked ChatGPT to act like an expert stock picker and recommend some stocks that could make us rich in 10 years.

If you want to skip our introduction to the investor and growth investing, then head on to Warren Buffett's 5 Growth Stock Picks. Warren Buffett is one of the most successful investors of our time. His investment strategy depends on identifying firms with solid business models that are primed for growth and market capture to profit from the resulting boost to the share price. He also has one of the largest non-bank investment portfolios in the stock market, with our research suggesting that Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio by the end of this year's second quarter was worth a whopping $348 billion. The investments in the portfolio are not evenly spread out, since Berkshire's biggest stake is in the Cupertino, California consumer technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). This stake is worth an unbelievable $177 billion and accounts for 51% of Mr. Buffett's overall holdings.However, while he might be absolutely sure about the future prospects of Apple, a firm that also pays a 24 cent dividend for a 0.55% yield, the second quarter saw Mr. Buffett take a bullish stance on a different sector. The Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes this year have pummeled a lot of sectors, and one of the hardest hit among these has been the real estate industry. Within real estate, office companies have been hit particularly hard since not only have the high rates made it difficult for firms to raise capital and make payments on existing loans, but the trend towards remote working has also left office property owners scratching their heads. For more details, check out 15 Worst Performing REITs in 2023.While Mr. Buffett kept away from the office real estate sector, he did buy a lot of shares in home building companies. Specifically, the June quarter saw him scoop up shares of three construction firms. These are NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI). Berkshire Hathaway cumulatively invested $814 million in the companies during the quarter. Out of these, the biggest stake is in D. R. Horton, as the investment firm bought 5.9 million shares that were worth $726 million.Story continuesD. R. Horton is one of America's largest home building companies in terms of volume, and the current high rate environment that has sapped consumer budgets would lead one to believe that its shares should be down considerably year to date. However, when we look at the stock's year to date performance, we find out that D. R. Horton's shares are up by 29% year to date, in line with the 30% gains of the S&amp;P Homebuilders Select Industry Index during the same time period. The industry has also performed well this year in terms of earnings, and the reason behind this is an interesting one that isn't often talked about. Simply put, home builders benefited from the surge in demand from the low rate coronavirus environment, and as interest rates were jacked up, there were able to significantly reduce their prices and offer buyers mortgage rates as low as 5%. This clever adaptation to the market environment has translated into strong share price gains for home buildings stocks, with investment bank Deutsche Bank penning an optimistic note for the sector in June when it shared:With continued improvement in demand fundamentals and book valuations fairly attractive by historical standards, our view is that homebuilder stocks can climb meaningfully higher.That said, we also overlay an actionable, stock-specific theme, encouraging investors to favor builders with executives dedicated to systematically and programmatically improving returns on inventory, growing tangible book value per share, and letting multiples follow those fundamentals.. . .We expect solid demand for new housing to accompany a continuing normalization of margins and returns, and as book values grow, the stocks should generally move higher, but we see opportunity for stock selection.We looked to identify those builders with higher post-pandemic returns on inventory, who can also be reasonably expected to make solid capital allocation choices that consistently improve return on equity.Seems like Warren Buffett agrees with Deutsche Bank when it comes to his latest stock picks. Today, we'll look at other growth stocks in his portfolio. As a refresher, a growth stock is typically a company that is expected to grow its earnings in the future. This is reflected in its share price, which is significantly higher than the firm's earnings per share. Some top Warren Buffett growth stocks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Markel Group Inc. (NYSE:MKL), and StoneCo Ltd. (NASDAQ:STNE).Warren Buffett's 11 Growth Stock PicksOur Methodology To compile our list of Warren Buffett's growth stocks, we took a look at Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio for Q2 2023 and selected the stocks that have a price to trailing earnings ratio higher than 30.Warren Buffett's 11 Growth Stock Picks11.

A Look At Its Intrinsic Value,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amphenol-corporation-nyse-aph-expensive-102429271.html,1692613469,STORY,['APH'],"[Key InsightsAmphenol's estimated fair value is US$68.81 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityAmphenol is estimated to be 24% overvalued based on current share price of US$85.23 The US$94.45 analyst price target for APH is 37% more than our estimate of fair valueDoes the August share price for Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Amphenol The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.92bUS$2.13bUS$2.23bUS$2.37bUS$2.47bUS$2.57bUS$2.65bUS$2.73bUS$2.81bUS$2.88bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.51%Est @ 3.81%Est @ 3.31%Est @ 2.96%Est @ 2.72%Est @ 2.55% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8% US$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$16bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.9b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.8%– 2.2%) = US$52bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$52b÷ ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$25bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$41b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$85.2, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amphenol as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.126. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for AmphenolStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Electronic industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electronic market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value? For Amphenol, we've put together three pertinent elements you should assess:Financial Health: Does APH have a healthy balance sheet?

July also marks the first year-over-year decrease in rent for studio units since 2020, continuing the downward trend led by two-bedroom units in May and one-bedroom units in June.""Renters in many areas are now spending slightly less on rent relative to their overall income, giving their budgets a little more breathing room at a time of stubborn inflation and ongoing affordability concerns,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist at Realtor.com®. ""With our midyear forecast update noting a surge in multi-family construction and an uptick in vacancy rates, we anticipate this downward pressure on rent prices will continue, providing many renters with much-needed stability in their housing expenses. Given the current rental market momentum and seasonal trends, it will be very unlikely to see a new peak rent in 2023.""July 2023 Rental Metrics by Unit Size – NationalUnit SizeMedian RentRent YoYRent Change – July 2019Overall$1,759-1.0 %24.7 %Studio$1,445-0.4 %18.0 %1-bed$1,642-0.6 %24.9 %2-bed$1,948-1.1 %26.9 % Affordability advancing slowly, supported by new supply In July 2023, nationwide rent was slightly more affordable than July of the previous year. To be considered affordable, one rule of thumb is that housing costs should fall below 30% of gross household income. In July 2023, people earning the typical household income and looking to rent would be spending 25.9% of their earnings to lease a typical for-rent home, down from 26.5% in July 2022. This positive change can be attributed to a combination of declining median rents and rising median household income. Additionally, increased supply is boosting vacancy rates and helping drive down rents. However, vacancy rates still remain below pre-pandemic levels, rent prices are elevated overall, and affordability continues to be a significant issue. Renters in eight of the top 50 metros, for example, pay a rent share higher than 30% relative to the median household income.Story continuesMiddle America remains an affordable oasis between costly coastal locations, for nowThe least affordable markets in July 2023 include coastal and Sun Belt locations, where renters often spent more than 30% of the median household income on housing costs. Miami, Fla., was by far the least affordable rental market, followed by Los Angeles, San Diego, New York City, Boston, Riverside, Calif., Tampa, Fla., and Orlando, Fla. In three of these eight cities, affordability has worsened compared with last year. In Miami, for example, renters would have spent 44.2% of their monthly paycheck on the typical rental in July 2023. Conversely, Oklahoma City was the most affordable rental market in July 2023, with renters spending 18.4% of their median household income on housing. Other affordable rental markets include midwestern mainstays such as Columbus, Ohio; Minneapolis, Minn.; Cincinnati; and Kansas City, Kan.South and West affordability improves, Midwest rents rise While rents in the South and West remain high, these areas show improved affordability, following a consistent downward rental cost trend during the preceding months. The most significant improvement was Riverside, Calif., where renters with a typical household income would spend 33.9% of their monthly paycheck on the typical rental in July 2023; while higher than the 30% affordability threshold, this represents a decline of 3.4 percentage points compared with 12 months ago. Meanwhile, strong demand in Midwest markets such as Milwaukee-Waukesha, Wis.; Birmingham, Ala.; and Indianapolis is driving lower vacancy rates and faster rent growth, eroding affordability in more traditionally budget-friendly locations.""As renters determine their next move, whether it's to stay put, save up to buy a home, or move and rent in a new location, the rental landscape is showing signs of improvement,"" said Jiayi Xu, Economist at Realtor.com®.

Realtor.com® began publishing regular monthly rental trends reports in October 2020 with data history stretching back to March 2019.With the release of its July rent report, Realtor.com® incorporated a new and improved methodology for capturing and reporting more comprehensive rental listing trends and metrics. The new methodology is expected to yield a cleaner, more representative and more consistent measurement of rental listings and trends at both the national and local level. The methodology has been adjusted to better represent the true cost of primary housing for renters.

82,b4c5ca06-df99-3437-a97d-19d635bedbf5,KLAC,2023-08-21,Investing in KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC) five years ago would have delivered you a 350% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-kla-nasdaq-klac-five-130023161.html,1692536423,STORY,['KLAC'],"[We think all investors should try to buy and hold high quality multi-year winners. And highest quality companies can see their share prices grow by huge amounts. Don't believe it? Then look at the KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) share price. It's 314% higher than it was five years ago. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. On top of that, the share price is up 14% in about a quarter. The company reported its financial results recently; you can catch up on the latest numbers by reading our company report.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for KLA In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, KLA managed to grow its earnings per share at 37% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 33% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that KLA has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, KLA's TSR for the last 5 years was 350%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that KLA shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 30% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 35% per year, is even more impressive. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for KLA   you should know about.Of course KLA may not be the best stock to buy.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the virtual reality industry which highlights key trends and major players, you can directly go to the 5 Best Virtual Reality Stocks to Invest In.Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that immerses users in a simulated digital environment, often through the use of specialized headsets and other sensory devices. The aim of VR is to create a sense of presence and interaction within a virtual world that can be visually and sometimes audibly or haptically experienced as if it were real. The technology crafts this engrossing encounter for users using devices like VR headsets, glasses, gloves, and bodysuits. Although virtual reality emerged in the 1990s, its true potential, promised three decades ago, is only now beginning to materialize. While VR currently finds its primary applications in gaming and entertainment, its capabilities hold significant promise across various sectors like engineering, design, healthcare, defense, and education. According to a report by Grand View Research, the worldwide market for virtual reality was valued at approximately $59.96 billion in 2022, with projections indicating a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.5% from 2023 to 2030.Currently, conventional VR setups employ VR headsets or multi-projected setups to generate lifelike sensations, mimicking a user's actual existence within a virtual world. This effect is predominantly achieved through VR headsets, which encompass head-mounted displays—enclosed headsets that prevent external light or real-world visuals from interfering with the virtual domain. Prominent providers of VR headsets encompass massive tech corporations like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), and naturally, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Enhancements in VR hardware, including the emergence of compact and stylish devices, are anticipated to bolster the wider acceptance of VR both among consumers and across various sectors. Healthcare, workforce training, and manufacturing are foreseen as some of the industries most profoundly influenced by VR's advancements. Instances of VR applications encompass training simulations for surgeons and production workers, as well as immersive educational encounters within classrooms. An example of such application includes Kansas City University's Center for Medical Education Innovation (CMEI), a teaching facility that allows medical students to learn how to evaluate, diagnose and treat patients in repetition with real-world simulation through the use of virtual reality and augmented reality (AR) technology.Story continuesFor now, the market is dominated by the gaming and entertainment sectors, where companies are making substantial investments in the creation of content, software, and hardware tailored for gaming applications. The increasing appeal of virtual theme parks, museums, and arcades contributes significantly to the expansion of this segment. The initial endeavors to integrate VR into video games can be traced back all the way back to the 1980s, with prominent examples like Nintendo's Virtual Boy and Matter, Inc.'s Power Glove. However, it wasn't until 2013 that VR gaming truly gained momentum, catalyzed by the introduction of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s Oculus Rift, which marked the advent of the first consumer-ready VR product. As a testament to its growth, the valuation of the VR gaming market was approximated at $6.26 billion in 2020. Projections indicate that this market is poised to expand to $53.44 billion by 2028, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate exceeding 30%.Overall, this industry is poised to grow with more companies planning to get involved. Companies like Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are among the many that are making strides in the space and could be at the forefront of the massive opportunity that virtual reality and augmented reality present. If you want to read up on different technological spaces, and their respective market analysis, you can start with our article on the 12 Best Metaverse Stocks To Invest In.Best Virtual Reality Stocks to BuyPhoto by mahdis mousavi on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked 12 VR-related companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Matterport, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTTR) is poised to reap the benefits from the VR race.11. Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U)Number of Hedge Funds Holders: 30Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U) stands as a prominent figure within the realm of real-time 3D content creation, solidifying its position as a dominant force in the VR market. Its platform serves as a toolbox that empowers developers to construct immersive 3D environments that form the very foundation of the virtual world. The company has achieved remarkable financial success, with a 56% year-over-year sales growth in the first quarter of 2023. Furthermore, Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U) has revised its fiscal 2023 outlook, anticipating even stronger results that are poised to surpass estimates.

Following its introduction in 2016, it emerged as a top-performing VR headset, even though its prominence was outshone by the 2020 launch of the Meta Quest 2. However, in 2023, Sony made a pivotal move by revamping the design of the original, which had been in circulation for over six years, giving birth to the PlayStation VR 2, which debuted in February 2023, accompanied by an initial price tag of $550—significantly surpassing the initial cost of $400 for its predecessor.Goldman Sachs analyst Minami Munakata raised the evaluation of Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) shares on July 12, shifting the rating from 'Neutral' to 'Buy' and including the stock in the firm's 'conviction buy list'.

This number was up from 30 in the previous quarter.

While initially established as a gaming hub for younger audiences, Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) has transformed into a premier hub for immersive gaming and social interactions within persistent virtual realms.

While there is a risk that we may be premature, mistaken, or even wrong in our evaluation of this opportunity, we see Roblox as a company with the potential to ‘matter’.Roblox is a 3D real-time content platform that bridges consumers and creators.

This eventually led to XiRang, an invisible web of technological capabilities that the company is developing to support the development of the metaverse.Morgan Stanley analyst Gary Yu's upgrade of Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) on June 20 shifted the rating from Equal Weight to Overweight, accompanied by a raised price target of $190, previously $160. The analyst highlights that Baidu, Inc.

QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)Number of Hedge Funds Holders: 73Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a multinational corporation based in San Diego, California, with its incorporation in Delaware.

The upcoming platform will also make use of Qualcomm's Snapdragon Spaces XR developer environment, founded on the OpenXR standards and rapidly embraced by a wide-ranging ecosystem, encompassing AR and VR system original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Honor, Motorola, Nubia, OnePlus, Oppo, RedMagic, Sharp, Vivo, Xiaomi, and ZTE.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 73 hedge funds were bullish on QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM, compared to 69 funds in the earlier quarter.Madison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock was volatile during the quarter but moved higher in March. Qualcomm fundamentals have been hurt over the last several quarters due to excess smartphone inventories. Management messaged in their recent conference call that inventory issues peaked in their first fiscal quarter and should begin to moderate. They are also seeing excess inventory in their IoT (Internet of Things) business, which will take a couple of quarters to work through. By our estimates, Qualcomm fundamentals should trough in the June quarter with a second-half recovery. Qualcomm remains well positioned to diversify away from smartphones with long-term growth in Auto and IoT.”6. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Funds Holders: 112Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), commonly abbreviated as AMD, is an American multinational semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, California, that develops computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Additionally, AMD's potent GPUs and processors provide the necessary horsepower for driving headsets like HTC's Vive, Microsoft's Windows Mixed Reality, and the Oculus Rift (now under Meta's umbrella). As the VR sector evolves, it's probable that more enterprises will seek out AMD's chips to fulfill their technological requirements.There were 112 hedge funds long Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in the second quarter of 2023, up from 91 in the preceding quarter. Philippe Lafont's Coutue Management was the company's largest shareholder for the quarter.Horizon Kinetics LLC said the following about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“It is among what are considered to be the great technology companies, like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel, that one is apt to see some of the greatest confusion between short-term financial results and share price movements, on the one hand, and long-term financial results. The former are exceedingly difficult to predict. Long term results are relatively easy to predict, because they are bound by the limiting realities of the business model. In the case of AMD, that is the business of being a large-scale semi-conductor manufacturer with a more dominant competitor that has a scale economy advantage.Here’s what people see, remember and act upon. In the past several years, AMD has been the best performing major technology stock. It’s outperformed Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta (Facebook) and Nvidia…” (Click here to read the full text)Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple, Inc.

The dividend has gone from an annual total of $2.00 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $6.72. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13% a year over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that Cummins has grown earnings per share at 23% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.Our Thoughts On Cummins' DividendOverall, it's great to see the dividend being raised and that it is still in a sustainable range. However, lack of cash flows makes us wary of the potential for cuts in the dividend's future, even though the dividend is generally looking okay. The dividend looks okay, but there have been some issues in the past, so we would be a little bit cautious.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for Cummins that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Nor do I believe futures will rip higher if Florida Governor Ron DeSantis says he would like to slash corporate taxes to 5% (but raise them to 90% for Disney).morning brief imageIt's Aug. 23, 2023, light years and 3,077 news cycles away from Election Day on November 5, 2024. None of the folks slated to be on the stage this week are polling particularly well and stand to be non-factors politically come November 2024.Moreover, the Republican front-runner for the presidency — former president Donald J. Trump — isn't going to be on stage as he deals with various legal problems and plays head games with his opponents from one of his resorts.But Wednesday night should be of interest to all investors for at least two reasons.First, it will offer an early snapshot into the potential headline risk to stocks as the presidential election cycle intensifies into 2024 and another heated Trump vs. Biden battle takes shape.Already, from a historical perspective, markets don't act well during the fourth year of a presidency, according to new data from Bank of America.Going back to 1928, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen on average from January to May in the final year of a presidency.Just imagine if the people on the Republican debate stage stink it up, ceding more ground to Trump. Won't another contentious match-up between Trump and Biden inject fresh volatility into markets in early 2024? It very likely will — and more so possibly than the historical average — suggesting it's good to get a feel of things right out of the chute in debate season.Story continuesThen on the other hand, who knows? The people on stage Wednesday may impress the nation and their policies on business will garner greater attention. Maybe one person begins to stick out as a strong contender to Biden, which could have implications for markets. If you don't do your due diligence today, you risk being behind the eight ball tomorrow.Smart investors appear to be getting this, which heartens me.""We’re keeping a close eye on polling data and betting markets for the 2024 Presidential race, which has been coming up more in our conversations over the past few weeks,"" RBC Capital Markets strategist Lori Calvasina said.

In early spring, the sector had been hit hard by a wave of awe-inducing bank failures. In particular, the sequential collapses of Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank triggered a panic among depositors and regulators. They then scrambled to prevent a systemic contagion. The crisis was, in part, facilitated by the U.S. Federal Reserve hiking interest rates as quickly as it did, which devalued the treasury bonds-holdings held on the balance sheets of many banks. However, a lack of proper risk management at the related institutions also played a significant role, making some bank stocks look lucrative.Ultimately, the crisis also exposed the wider vulnerability of banks that had invested heavily in long-term treasury bonds, which lost value as interest rates rose sharply in response to inflationary pressures. To make matters worse, Moody’s, one of the leading credit rating agencies, recently downgraded the credit ratings of a swath of small and mid-sized U.S. banks, citing a substantial amount of unrealized loan losses not being captured by regulatory capital ratios.However, not all banks are created equal, and some have managed to weather the storm better than others. In fact, some bank stockss may offer attractive opportunities for investors who are looking for undervalued and resilient stocks that can benefit from the economic recovery and the normalization of interest rates. Here are three bank stocks that fit the bill.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTruist Financial Corporation (TFC)Smartphone with website of American financial company Truist Financial Corporation on screen in front of logo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comFormed by the merger of BB&amp;T and SunTrust in December 2019, Truist (NYSE:TFC) has transformed into a regional powerhouse with a strong presence in the southeast and mid-Atlantic states. The regional bank is the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets. It has approximately $555 billion of assets on balance sheet as of August and features a diversified business model, offering a range of services such as retail and commercial banking, wealth management, insurance, mortgage and capital markets.Story continuesTruist has delivered uneven financial performance in 2023, despite the challenging environment. In the second quarter, the bank reported a net income of $1.3 billion. Though technically a year-over-year decline from last year, these metrics make sense in the current high interest rate environment which has made lending riskier for many banks, increasing loan loss provisions. These provisions offer a glimpse at how a bank expects its loan portfolio and revenue stream to perform as borrowers struggle to make monthly payments. It also has a negative effect on a bank’s profitability.On the bright side, the bank’s insurance business, a consistent bright spot, posted a record $935 million in revenue, which was up more than 13% YoY. Additionally, Truist has also maintained a strong capital position, with a common equity tier 1 ratio (CET1) of 9.6%, well above the regulatory minimum of 4.5%. This ratio measures the amount of liquid assets on balance sheet versus total risk-adjusted assets.In terms of share performance, Truist’s shares have largely underperformed the broader market in 2023, falling more than 26% year-to-date, compared to a 16% gain for the Standards and Practices (S&amp;P) 500 index. However, the stock trades relatively cheaply at 9.2 times forward earnings and offers a generous dividend yield of 6.6%. These financial characteristics along with the bank’s regional prowess should get investors interested.U.S. Bancorp (USB)The logo for U.S. Bancorp's U.S. Bank is displayed on the side of a building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comU.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, with $680 billion as of the second quarter. The bank operates in 25 states across the midwest and western regions, serving more than 18 million customers through its network of more than 2,700 branches and 4,400 ATMs. U.S. Bancorp also offers a wide range of products and services, including consumer and business banking, wealth management, payment services and corporate and investment banking.U.S. Bancorp has been one of the most consistent performers among U.S. banks, delivering superior profitability and efficiency ratios throughout the years. In the second quarter of 2023, the bank reported a net income of $1.5 billion. Similar to Truist, Bancorp suffered from higher provisions for credit losses. However, despite this setback, Bancorp maintained a robust capital position, increasing its CET1 ratio by 60 basis points to 9.1%. While U.S. Bancorp’s shares are down 9.5% year-to-date, the stock remains undervalued. U.S. Bancorp is trading at around 9.3 times forward earnings. The bank also offers an attractive dividend yield of 4.87%.M&amp;T Bank Corporation (MTB)a person putting a coin into a piggy bankSource: ShutterstockM&amp;T Bank (NYSE:MTB) happens to be the smallest bank on this list. America’s 19th-largest bank by assets operates in 12 states and offers a variety of products and services, including retail and commercial banking, wealth management, mortgage and commercial lending. Out of the group on the list, M&amp;T Bank delivered the strongest financial performance. In the second quarter in particular, the bank reported a net income of $867 million, up 299% year-over-year. If we exclude the bank’s $225 million sale of its “Collective Investment Trust business,” earnings were only up 20% from last year, but this is by no means a modest gain either. This strong net income growth was driven by both higher interest rates and demand for loans. M&amp;T Bank also maintained a solid CET1 ratio at 10.59%.Shares of M&amp;T Bank have fallen more than 6% year-to-date, but strong revenue and earnings figures compared to others small-to-midsized banks could see shares end on a more positive note this year. M&amp;T’s cheap valuation also drives its attractiveness: shares are trading at 9.4x forward earnings. This is one of the most undervalued bank stocks on the market.

For now though, traders on the money market see a 89% chance of the Fed holding rates at current levels at its September meeting, according to Investing.com's fed rate monitor tool.WTI for the most active October contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled down 54 cents, or 0.7%, at $80.12 per barrel. WTI hit a session high of $81.74 earlier. The U.S. crude benchmark finished last week down 2.3% after a near 20% gain over seven previous weeks.Story continuesBrent settled down 34 cents, or 0.4%, at $84.46 per barrel. It earlier hit a session high of $85.83. The global crude benchmark lost around 3% last week after a seven-week rally that gave oil bulls an 18% return.Some analysts said crude was expected to stay volatile through the week and possibly end lower on weaker technicals, combined with the “China-bear” story and expectations for a hawkish Fed at Jackson Hole.China's renewed economic weakness has raised questions over whether its oil demand can remain resilient.Evergrande, one of China’s biggest names in real estate, filed Thursday for Chapter 15 bankruptcy, which is a way for foreign companies to use US bankruptcy law to restructure debt. The process will take time, as Evergrande has roughly $19 billion in offshore debt.The filing serves as a cautionary tale about the growth-at-all-costs model that underpinned China’s spectacular growth over the past 30 years. For decades, Evergrande — pronounced “ever grand,” with a silent final “e” — gobbled up debt as China’s economy exploded. Demand for housing was so strong, homebuilders often pre-sold apartment units to buyers before construction was complete.But a sudden shift in policy by China’s leaders two years ago has left the country’s property developers scrambling for cash, compounding financial risks within the world’s second-largest economy.Evergrande’s crisis raises questions on which would be the next shoe to drop on the Chinese economy. And that appears to be Country Garden, another major name in realty which employs some 300,000 people. The firm has already missed two payments on its multibillion-dollar debt and said it was considering “various debt management measures.July was a particularly woeful month for China, with one bad patch of economic data after another, from bank loans at a 14-year low and exports sliding their most since February 2020. The yuan also tumbled against the dollar, adding to the weight on commodities, particularly oil.The People’s Bank of China cut its one-year loan prime rate by 10 basis points to 3.45% earlier Monday. While this was less than had been expected, and the five-year rate which is used to determine mortgage costs was left unchanged, this still suggests that Beijing is determined to support the second largest economy in the world as it struggles with a slowing post-COVID economic recovery. The Chinese central bank unexpectedly cut short and medium-term lending rates last week.""It seems that (China's recovery) is not going to happen,"" John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, said. ""It's doubtful they're going to be buying. They bought a lot of crude for storage earlier in the year. They're sitting on a lot of crude.""(Additional reporting by Peter Nurse in London and Ambar Warrick in Singapore)Related ArticlesOil down again; Saudi-Russia cuts lose out to weak China, hawkish FedCrude oil settles lower as hope fades for Chinese demandStorm brewing in Gulf of Mexico to strengthen en route to Texas]"
99,f0cd542c-438c-33df-b93c-c87c0a339e72,DVN,2023-08-21,Ken Fisher’s Top 15 Energy Stock Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ken-fisher-top-15-energy-181444280.html,1692555284,STORY,"['CVX', 'MRO', 'BP', 'HAL', 'XOM', 'DVN', 'HES', 'PBR-A', 'EQNR']","[In this piece, we will take a look at Ken Fisher's top 15 energy stock picks. If you want to skip our introduction to the billionaire hedge fund boss and the energy industry, then jump ahead to Ken Fisher's Top 5 Energy Stock Picks. This year has been a reality check for the energy industry, after record high profits last year in the wake of the crude oil supply chain shock due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Oil companies, large and small, had bathed in record high profits last year. Leading the pack when it comes to big oil and 2022 oil industry profits is the American giant Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) which brought in a massive $59 billion in profits and set a new record for the earnings of any Western oil company. In second, third, fourth, and fifth places are Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE), and BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP), which earned $39.9 billion, $36.5 billion, $36.2 billion, and $27.7 billion in profits, respectively. This enabled Shell to set a new profit record in its century-old history, and cumulatively, the oil giants brought in a stunning $200 billion in profits.These profits also led to handsome shareholder rewards, with the oil companies paying out a whopping $110 billion to investors in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Additionally, Europe's rapid diversification from Russian gas to other sources also led to the Norwegian state owned oil and gas company Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) doubling its operating income to $74.9 billion last year. Safe to say, 2022 was a year that neither the oil companies nor the consumer hit by record high pump prices will forget anytime in the future.Moving forward to 2023, big oil it seems is in for a reckoning. For the second quarter of 2023, Shell and TotalEnergies reported painful 56% and 49% profit drops, respectively. Despite this, Total managed to still grow profits over the second quarter of 2021 while Shell's results remained in line with the earnings during the same time period. Equinor reported an even sharper drop as its Q2 profits tanked by 57% annually, but none of these could match BP's turmoil as the British oil giant reported its profits dropping by 70%. This trend is also present in smaller American oil exploration, production, and equipment companies. In fact, when it comes to share price performance this year, nearly all of the worst performing companies this year are either those that provide production equipment to oil companies or hold interests in petroleum producing properties. For more details, you can check out 15 Worst Performing Energy Stocks in 2023.Story continuesSo, if energy is your favored investing segment, then right now might be the optimal time to scoop some stocks. As a primer, energy stocks tend to well in a robust economic environment as stronger corporate growth and more disposable incomes naturally lead to greater demand for their products. And one easy way to sift stocks is to take a look at what the professionals are doing.One such professional, whose decades of experience in the stock market has provided him with remarkable insights into the markets, is none other than the billionaire Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments. Mr. Fisher is one of the richest people in the world, with his latest net worth estimated at a cool $6.8 billion. He is also one of the very few financial gurus out there that had correctly predicted last year that October was the start of a bull market. This was when most analysts were fearful of a recession. He continued being the wise guru that he is earlier this year when he bucked the trend of panic in the midst of a regional banking crisis and stressed that the risks of contagion remain minimal.Given the current uncertainty about the future of the stock market for the remainder of the year, Mr. Fisher is back with his wisdom. He continues to be the optimist, stressing in a recent video:So the reality is, sentiment is consistent with a continued bull market. We're not in pessimism anymore, but, we're not anywhere close to optimism. We got a ways to run. In the long term, the market is about economics and reality. And as Ben Graham famously said, ""In the short term, the market's a voting machine. In the long term, it's a weighing machine."" That long term is weighing those real things. In the short term, it's a voting machine which is more like an election and it's really about, who do you like,  what are you afraid of. It's more about your emotions and sentiment. And that sentiment part is important to focus on. It right now is in a category regardless of which subsets of it you look at in the marketplace. Newsletters, pension plans, high retail investors, money managers, it's in the skepticism phase. And with that, you should remember Warren Buffett's famous line, that you should be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful. And right now people are not overly greedy. So, you should be.Some of Ken Fisher's top energy stock picks are TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL).Ken Fisher's Top 15 Energy Stock PicksOur Methodology To compile our list of Ken Fisher's top energy stock picks, we took a look at Fisher Investments' latest filings with the SEC that list down the firm's investments during the second quarter of 2023.

100,7e93890f-75aa-3591-b788-6431780f4814,DVN,2023-08-21,7 Oil Stocks to Buy as the Energy Sector Bounces Back,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-oil-stocks-buy-energy-190311003.html,1692039791,STORY,"['PXD', 'HAL', 'CVX', 'DVN', 'PSX', 'KMI', 'RIG']","[While it might not seem plausible at first glance, the narrative of oil stocks to buy is making a comeback. True, the Federal Reserve and its largely aggressive measures to tackle inflation through raising the benchmark interest rate in principle drive down the price of commodities, including hydrocarbon products. However, a few factors contribute to the sector’s rise.First, the revenge travel phenomenon that dominated business headlines in 2022 continues to play a strong role this year. Some of it has to do with Asian countries opening up near the back half of 2022 to early 2023. Therefore, even with the Fed’s hawkish policy, energy stocks have ticked higher recently. Second, the return-to-office pivot will likely undergird oil and gas stocks. It’s at a point now where big corporations like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are warning their employees about ignoring in-office mandates. It’s almost certain that worker bees will acquiesce because they don’t have unlimited funds.So, whether we like it or not, oil and gas stocks may continue to rise throughout this year. Below are some names to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsChevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with ""diesel"" and ""food mart"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAn integrated play among oil stocks to buy, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) deals with all components of the energy value chain: upstream (exploration and production), midstream (storage and transportation), and downstream (refining and marketing). Since the start of the year, CVX slipped about 6%, which doesn’t seem encouraging. However, in the trailing month, it’s up nearly 3%.Fundamentally, Chevron offers relatively stable exposure for those seeking energy stocks. Aside from a blip in 2016 and, of course, in 2020, the company is consistently profitable. It commands a trailing-year net margin of 14.09%, beating out almost 68% of its peers. As well, it features a return on asset (ROA) of 11.76%, outflanking 78.81% of sector rivals.Story continuesCurrently, Wall Street analysts peg CVX as a consensus moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as 11 buys, six holds and zero sells. Further, the experts’ average price target lands at $188.06, implying almost 15% upside potential.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comA specialist in the midstream component of the energy value chain, Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) offers a vital connection between enterprises that produce raw hydrocarbons and entities that refine the material for use in various applications, including into our combustion-powered vehicles. From a year-to-date perspective, KMI doesn’t seem that impressive, down more than 1%. However, in the past month, it’s shown modest signs of life.Fundamentally, this framework should improve, especially if more cars are on the road due to social normalization protocols (such as the return to the office). To be fair, it’s a bit riskier than other oil stocks to buy. For example, shares trade at a forward multiple of 15.26, which is quite overvalued. However, investors shouldn’t ignore that it’s been consistently profitable over the past decade.That’s not surprising given the relevance of midstream operators. Presently, analysts peg KMI as a consensus moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as three buys, six holds and zero sells. Also, the average expert price target lands at $20.88, implying over 17% upside potential.Phillips 66 (PSX)Phillips 66 gas station in the daytimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA downstream specialist, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) deserves closer consideration regarding oil stocks to buy. Data from the U.S. Federal Highway Administration shows that vehicle miles traveled have been steadily increasing since the doldrums of the Covid-19 pandemic. It’s not quite to the levels seen prior to the public health crisis. But that’s also the upside opportunity for PSX stock.Basically, the underlying company’s total addressable market should theoretically only rise from here. That’s not a guarantee, to be clear. However, social trends point to the normalization of pre-pandemic standards, not to what we believe the post-pandemic paradigm should be. Therefore, the downstream component of energy stocks should warrant closer investigation.Notably, Wall Street analysts aren’t waiting around for retail investors to wake up. Presently, they tag PSX as a consensus moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as eight buys, three holds and zero sells. Also, the average price target comes in at $125.70, implying almost 8% upside potential.Devon Energy (DVN)An image of a hand holding a smartphone displaying the Devon Energy Corporation logo in front of a computer screenSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comAn independent entity among oil and gas stocks, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) offers investors a higher-risk, higher-reward profile. For example, DVN slipped more than 13% since the beginning of this year. Obviously, that’s not a great look, especially compared to the supermajors. However, Devon is attempting to claw back from its hole. In the trailing one-month period, shares have “only” lost a little more than 1%.Again, that’s not necessarily an encouraging look for risk-intolerant investors. However, should you believe in the pivoting fundamentals to a bullish outlook, DVN should offer substantially more upside. In the meantime, prospective buyers of oil stocks may consider the value proposition. For instance, DVN trades at a trailing multiple of 6.9. As a discount to earnings, Devon ranks better than 60% of other energy stocks.Looking at Wall Street, analysts peg DVN as a moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as eight buys and seven holds. Further, the average price target hits $61.87, implying nearly 23% upside potential.Halliburton (HAL)The Halliburton (HAL) logo on the website homepage. HAL stock price prediction.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comOne of the biggest oilfield services companies, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) provides products and services for the ever-evolving needs of the energy industry, per its website. While market participants often focus on “direct” plays regarding oil stocks to buy, an enterprise like Halliburton deserves closer attention. After all, if demand for hydrocarbons picks up, sector-related services firms will likely ride coattails.Notably, HAL gained slightly over 8% since the beginning of this year. In the trailing one-month period, shares swung up over 7%. Given the fundamental rise in energy stocks, Halliburton may have more room to run. Therefore, I’m not particularly worried about its earnings multiples, which admittedly run on the high side. Instead, I’m focused on compelling metrics, such as stronger-than-average operating and net margins.Also, the Street has spoken, with HAL earning a unanimous strong buy. And that’s not a cheap unanimous vote as it’s among 15 experts. Further, their average price target stands at $45.50, implying nearly 12% upside potential.Transocean (RIG)Person holding smartphone with logo of offshore drilling company Transocean Ltd. (RIG) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comUnquestionably one of the hottest names among oil stocks to buy, Transocean (NYSE:RIG) is the world’s largest offshore drilling contractor based on revenue, per its public profile. On a technical level, RIG has acutely felt the bullish pivot in the hydrocarbon space. Since the start of the year, shares have nearly doubled in value. They continue to impress, with shares gaining over 7% in the past 30 (calendar) days.Fundamentally, Transocean symbolizes the dramatic sentiment shift in the offshore oil space. During the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, offshore oil drillers ranked among the worst investments of 2020. Now, it’s one of the best plays. Further, despite their significantly overvalued profile (based on commonly gauged valuation metrics), there could be more upside remaining.Basically, normalization trends will continue to positively undergird energy stocks. And you know what? Analysts agree, pegging RIG a moderate buy. As well, the high-side price target of $12 calls for almost 40% upside potential.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD)Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD) logo seen on a smartphone with a green and yellow backgroundSource: rafapress / ShutterstockOne of the top independent oil and gas stocks, Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) is off to a solid start compared to sector rivals. Since the beginning of this year, PXD gained almost 8%. Most impressively, in the trailing one-month period, shares swung up nearly 10%. For those that want a more adventurous idea in the hydrocarbon space, PXD could fill this niche.Financially, Pioneer offers a well-balanced profile. Overall, it commands solid fiscal stability, as evidenced by its Altman Z-Score of 3.92. Operationally, Pioneer prints a three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 18.7%, beating out 67.41% of its peers. Further, its net margin clocks in at 28.39%, above 80.23% of the competition.Lastly, analysts are generally enthusiastic about PXD, although some doubters exist. Overall, the consensus view is a moderate buy. This rating breaks down as eight buys, nine holds and two sells. Finally, the average price target comes out to $252.11, implying over 6% upside.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for American Express American Express Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Monique Herena, sold US$2.6m worth of shares at a price of US$173 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$160. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.All up, insiders sold more shares in American Express than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does American Express Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that American Express insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$164m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About American Express Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded American Express shares in the last quarter. While we feel good about high insider ownership of American Express, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. Of course, the future is what matters most.

(NASDAQ:NTAP) saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine NetApp’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for NetApp What's The Opportunity In NetApp?Good news, investors! NetApp is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $106.44, but it is currently trading at US$75.31 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, NetApp’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from NetApp?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of NetApp, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -16%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although NTAP is currently undervalued, the negative outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. I recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to NTAP, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NTAP for some time, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you research further into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks Yielding at Least 7% According to Hedge Funds. Currently, the stock market is in an unpredictable phase, and experts hold varying opinions about the country’s economic outlook. According to a report by Forbes, the New York Fed's indicator suggests a 66% likelihood of a U.S. recession within the next year. In addition to this, the Federal Reserve has repeatedly warned that its ongoing practice of interest rate increases will lead to a slowdown in economic growth. On the other hand, the University of Michigan reported that consumer confidence in the U.S. rose by 13% in July as compared to last year, reaching its highest point since 2021. This indicates that consumers are likely to continue spending actively.Regardless of the situation, experts always advise investors to prepare for potential challenges by creating portfolios that can withstand unfavorable economic situations. Including dividend stocks in a portfolio can be a strategy to navigate negative market sentiment. In the past, these equities have often performed better than other types of stocks during economic downturns. In addition to this, these companies have sound financial health and improved cash flow, allowing them to distribute dividends to their shareholders.In Morningstar’s August report, David Harrell, an editorial director at the financial services firm, advises investors to examine a company's past track record in various economic situations, particularly whether it managed to maintain dividend payments during economic downturns or industry-related challenges. Some of the best dividend stocks in this regard are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). These companies have a solid track record of increasing their dividends over time, which makes investors feel confident about them.Story continuesAlso read: 10 Dividend Stocks with Over 8% YieldOver the years, dividends have represented a significant portion of the market’s overall return. The MSCI Value Index, which tracks the performance of stocks that are considered undervalued or trading at lower prices relative to their fundamentals, returned 303% in the last 25 years, with dividends contributing 72% to the total return during this period. The index methodology considers factors like book value, price-to-earnings ratio, and dividend yield to select and weight the stocks within the index.Dividend yields play a significant role when investing in dividend stocks because healthy yields can bring investors profits from their investments. Additionally, stocks with high dividends have typically done better than their peers over the years. In one of our articles, we reported that high-yield dividend stocks showed less volatility in their value over the past 15 years.10 Best Dividend Stocks Yielding at Least 7% According to Hedge FundsOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds as of Q2 2023 and picked dividend stocks that have yields above 7%, as of August 20.

If you want to skip our introduction to the investor and growth investing, then head on to Warren Buffett's 5 Growth Stock Picks. Warren Buffett is one of the most successful investors of our time. His investment strategy depends on identifying firms with solid business models that are primed for growth and market capture to profit from the resulting boost to the share price. He also has one of the largest non-bank investment portfolios in the stock market, with our research suggesting that Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio by the end of this year's second quarter was worth a whopping $348 billion. The investments in the portfolio are not evenly spread out, since Berkshire's biggest stake is in the Cupertino, California consumer technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). This stake is worth an unbelievable $177 billion and accounts for 51% of Mr. Buffett's overall holdings.However, while he might be absolutely sure about the future prospects of Apple, a firm that also pays a 24 cent dividend for a 0.55% yield, the second quarter saw Mr. Buffett take a bullish stance on a different sector. The Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes this year have pummeled a lot of sectors, and one of the hardest hit among these has been the real estate industry. Within real estate, office companies have been hit particularly hard since not only have the high rates made it difficult for firms to raise capital and make payments on existing loans, but the trend towards remote working has also left office property owners scratching their heads. For more details, check out 15 Worst Performing REITs in 2023.While Mr. Buffett kept away from the office real estate sector, he did buy a lot of shares in home building companies. Specifically, the June quarter saw him scoop up shares of three construction firms. These are NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI). Berkshire Hathaway cumulatively invested $814 million in the companies during the quarter. Out of these, the biggest stake is in D. R. Horton, as the investment firm bought 5.9 million shares that were worth $726 million.Story continuesD. R. Horton is one of America's largest home building companies in terms of volume, and the current high rate environment that has sapped consumer budgets would lead one to believe that its shares should be down considerably year to date. However, when we look at the stock's year to date performance, we find out that D. R. Horton's shares are up by 29% year to date, in line with the 30% gains of the S&amp;P Homebuilders Select Industry Index during the same time period. The industry has also performed well this year in terms of earnings, and the reason behind this is an interesting one that isn't often talked about. Simply put, home builders benefited from the surge in demand from the low rate coronavirus environment, and as interest rates were jacked up, there were able to significantly reduce their prices and offer buyers mortgage rates as low as 5%. This clever adaptation to the market environment has translated into strong share price gains for home buildings stocks, with investment bank Deutsche Bank penning an optimistic note for the sector in June when it shared:With continued improvement in demand fundamentals and book valuations fairly attractive by historical standards, our view is that homebuilder stocks can climb meaningfully higher.That said, we also overlay an actionable, stock-specific theme, encouraging investors to favor builders with executives dedicated to systematically and programmatically improving returns on inventory, growing tangible book value per share, and letting multiples follow those fundamentals.. . .We expect solid demand for new housing to accompany a continuing normalization of margins and returns, and as book values grow, the stocks should generally move higher, but we see opportunity for stock selection.We looked to identify those builders with higher post-pandemic returns on inventory, who can also be reasonably expected to make solid capital allocation choices that consistently improve return on equity.Seems like Warren Buffett agrees with Deutsche Bank when it comes to his latest stock picks. Today, we'll look at other growth stocks in his portfolio. As a refresher, a growth stock is typically a company that is expected to grow its earnings in the future. This is reflected in its share price, which is significantly higher than the firm's earnings per share. Some top Warren Buffett growth stocks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Markel Group Inc. (NYSE:MKL), and StoneCo Ltd. (NASDAQ:STNE).Warren Buffett's 11 Growth Stock PicksOur Methodology To compile our list of Warren Buffett's growth stocks, we took a look at Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio for Q2 2023 and selected the stocks that have a price to trailing earnings ratio higher than 30.Warren Buffett's 11 Growth Stock Picks11.

111,e1940e01-7801-3682-af11-50e7be9a6f15,SRE,2023-08-21,7 Dividend Stocks to Buy as Investor Sentiment Falters,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-stocks-buy-investor-193852614.html,1692041932,STORY,"['KR', 'SRE', 'ABBV', 'HD', 'JNJ']","[While optimism in the broader market remains robust – particularly for hyped-up sectors like technology – investors may still want to consider the relative safety of dividend stocks to buy. Notably, in the trailing month, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index went absolutely nowhere. That could be a sign that to go the conservative route.To use a specific baseball analogy, acquiring the best dividend stocks is the opposite of what Los Angeles did at the trade deadline. According to Barstool Sports, the Angels were “reckless” to be buyers instead of sellers. Bottom line, the club may have severely comprised its future because a) key players may leave, and b) it’s on the hook financially for aging and ineffective veterans.To put it bluntly, the Angels didn’t run the realistic math of their circumstances. But for astute investors, the math points to at least some exposure to the best dividend stocks. Basically, we just don’t know what the future may hold. So, if you want to stay in the market, go with passive income providers. Below are some ideas to consider, including stocks with high dividends.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, the narrative for Kroger (NYSE:KR) as one of the best dividend stocks to buy sells itself. It comes down to the trade-down effect. As economic pressures build, consumers will trade down their purchases to cheaper alternatives. Well, you can’t really go much cheaper than Kroger unless you want to compromise your health with cheap processed food. Therefore, Kroger may be economically insulated.Of course, that doesn’t mean that Kroger is immune to downside pressure. Still, if I had to pick some market ideas to last me the long haul, I’d have difficulty ignoring KR. For example, shares traded at a forward multiple of 10.82. As a discount to projected earnings, the grocery giant ranks better than 87.3% of its peers. It also enjoys solid revenue growth and consistent annual profitability.Story continuesAs for the topic at hand, Kroger carries a forward yield of 2.37%. Moreover, the company features 17 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Not only that, the payout ratio sits at 25.75%. Thus, investors won’t have to worry too much about yield sustainability. It’s one of the no-brainer dividend stocks.Home Depot (HD)Home Depot (HD) storefront on a sunny daySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA reliable enterprise, home improvement retailer Home Depot (NYSE:HD) offers a sensible idea for dividend stocks to buy. No, it’s not the most exciting company to acquire. And it’s probably not going to make you rich, whether through its capital gains potential or its yield. However, when faced with significant economic uncertainties, Home Depot offers resilience.Basically, its business of offering core consumer goods won’t go out of style. Financially, Home Depot also presents a rather boring picture. Per investment data aggregator Gurufocus, HD is fairly valued; nothing special here. However, it features a solid three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 15.2%, along with an EBITDA growth rate of 16.7% during the same period. It’s also consistently profitable, as you might expect.On the passive income front, HD features a forward yield of 2.52%. In addition, it enjoys a track record of 14 years of consecutive payout increases. Therefore, it’s one of the best dividend stocks to buy for reliability.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Negative Press Presents a Buying Opportunity with JNJ StockSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comA healthcare giant, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) now focuses on its larger medical devices and pharmaceutical business units following its spinoff of Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE), which will tackle the consumer products side. Honestly, I can see either enterprise as solid long-term wagers for dividend stocks to buy. However, J&amp;J may offer significant resilience should the economy suffer some snags.In many ways, medical devices and pharmaceuticals are insulated from the ebb and flow of market conditions. They’re not perfectly insulated but they offer some measure of predictability. Cynically, people will find ways to bolster their health when they face troubles.On a financial note, J&amp;J isn’t that remarkable. Again, Gurufocus labels it fairly valued. However, it’s a consistently profitable enterprise, which is what you’d expect from this massive label. For passive income, J&amp;J carries a forward yield of 2.74%. It’s not that generous, though it’s noticeably above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. However, here’s the takeaway: the company enjoys 62 years of consecutive dividend increases.Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comMoving onto arguably the most cynical idea for dividend stocks to buy on this list, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) warrants close attention. Based in San Diego, California, Sempra is a public utility. I’ll tell you this much as a regional “insider,” if you will. Sempra isn’t winning many friends among its user base. However, it doesn’t give a hoot because it benefits from two fundamental catalysts.First, the company represents a natural monopoly. Basically, the barrier to entry is so high that would-be competitors don’t even bother. Second, Sempra benefits from a captive audience. It’s not as if its utility customers can vote the company off the island. If you want to live in the most beautiful part of Southern California, you got to pay the sunshine tax.And that tax has a name, the unofficial iteration being unrepeatable in polite company. Turning to passive income, Sempra offers a forward yield of 3.3%. Now we’re getting into stocks with high dividends. Also, the payout ratio comes in at just under 50%, which is very reasonable for the yield you’re getting.AbbVie (ABBV)Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comOne of my favorite pharmaceutical companies, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) could easily rank among the dividend stocks to buy. I’m not just talking about the immediate time period but rather about the long haul. With the company’s acquisition of Allergan, AbbVie now controls Botox. A cosmetic prescription medicine, Botox will almost certainly rise in demand as millennials get older.Cynically speaking, millennials represent a rather vain demographic, given their obsession with social media. And that goes five-fold for Generation Z. So, when these youth-and-looks-obsessed folks grow older – oh, the horror! – they’re going to be desperate to retain their aesthetic vigor.Do you know those nasty comments that Paulina Porizkova gets? Well, the joke’s going to be on the Zoomers that are lashing out at her when they become Porizkova’s age. The other beautiful thing about AbbVie is its forward yield of 3.89%. Running conspicuously higher than the underlying sector average, ABBV makes a case for stocks with high dividends. Also, its payout ratio of 53.47% isn’t too shabby.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVWith so much hype centered on artificial intelligence, IBM (NYSE:IBM) would seem a shoo-in for dividend stocks to buy. And it’s exactly that, in my opinion. However, I’ve got to be honest – the market doesn’t seem to feel this narrative. Since the start of the year, shares gained just a hair over 1%. Nevertheless, in the trailing month, IBM gained nearly 8% of equity value.It’s possible folks got the message. While so many companies love waxing poetic about AI, “Big Blue” has been at the forefront of digital intelligence. With initiatives like Watson, the company continues to push what’s possible with machine learning. Also, investors benefit from partnerships generating real AI solutions rather than laboratory gimmicks.And it gets better. Right now, IBM offers a forward yield of 4.64%. This yield easily makes Big Blue one of the stocks with high yields, outpacing the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, the company commands 30 years of consecutive payout increases.Philip Morris (PM)packs of cigarettes in convenience store rackSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.comTo be sure, identifying Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) as one of the best dividend stocks to buy isn’t devoid of controversy. As one of the big tobacco firms, Philip Morris probably won’t court too many folks’ sympathies. At the same time, I’m a big believer in adult choices. If you want to partake in tobacco products, that decision is up to you, not the government or any other authority.Of course, the big criticism of PM – from a business perspective as opposed to a moral one – centers on fading global smoking rates. However, vaporizers or e-cigarettes, or e-vapor (or whatever you want to call them) products have risen in popularity.In fairness, there’s an ugly side to this demand profile which is a different discussion for a different day. But with so many “analog” smokers seeking a cleaner alternative, Philip Morris could benefit from rising demand. For now, it’s one of the stocks with high dividends. Specifically, PM carries a forward yield of 5.28%. Also, it commands 14 years of consecutive dividend increases. Just watch for the payout ratio of 73.89%, which is on the high side.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

112,0166841c-e9ec-3abe-9f1c-bcf8e2a11296,LYB,2023-08-21,Why It Might Not Make Sense To Buy LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB) For Its Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-not-sense-buy-100850078.html,1692612530,STORY,['LYB'],"[LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 3 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase LyondellBasell Industries' shares before the 25th of August in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 5th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.25 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$5.00 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, LyondellBasell Industries has a trailing yield of 5.1% on the current stock price of $97.39. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. LyondellBasell Industries paid out 75% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out 102% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Companies usually need cash more than they need earnings - expenses don't pay themselves - so it's not great to see it paying out so much of its cash flow.While LyondellBasell Industries's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were LyondellBasell Industries to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're discomforted by LyondellBasell Industries's 12% per annum decline in earnings in the past five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, LyondellBasell Industries has lifted its dividend by approximately 1.4% a year on average.Final TakeawayIs LyondellBasell Industries an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? LyondellBasell Industries had an average payout ratio, but its free cash flow was lower and earnings per share have been declining. It's not that we think LyondellBasell Industries is a bad company, but these characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance.With that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of LyondellBasell Industries don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business. Our analysis shows 3 warning signs for LyondellBasell Industries and you should be aware of these before buying any shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

EL reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the top and bottom lines coming ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the bottom line declined year over year. Shares of the company were down more than 6% in the pre-market trading session on Aug 18.Fiscal 2023 net sales descended 10% to $15.9 billion, with the adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.46 tumbling 49% on a constant currency or cc basis. Results were largely hurt by softness in Asia travel retail (mainly in Hainan and Korea), somewhat compensated by improvements in nearly all other regions. The operating landscape in fiscal 2023 continued to bear hurdles associated with the pandemic, especially in Asia travel retail and mainland China, wherein the recovery was slower than anticipated.However, management remains positive about the future prospects of global prestige beauty. This, along with a robust brand position, keeps the company well-placed for diversified growth in its portfolio.Quarter in DetailThe company posted adjusted earnings of 7 cents per share, which came much ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents. However, the bottom line slumped significantly from earnings of 42 cents reported in the year-ago period. Adjusted EPS came in at 11 cents at cc.The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Estee Lauder Companies Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. QuoteNet sales of $3,609 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,479.5 million. The metric climbed nearly 1% from $3,561 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Organic net sales grew 4%, mainly due to a solid increase in Asia/Pacific, wherein the company saw double-digit growth in all categories and markets continued to recover.  Organic sales growth was backed by strength in the Makeup, Fragrance and Hair Care categories, along with a robust increase in the company’s global emerging markets. The Skin Care category witnessed softness due to hurdles in the company’s travel retail business in Asia.The adjusted gross profit came in at $2,467 million, down 3% year over year. The adjusted operating income came in at $71 million, down 66% from $207 million reported in the year-ago period.Story continuesProduct-Based Segment ResultsSkin Care’s sales were down 5% year over year to $1,794 million. Makeup revenues jumped 12% year over year to $1,108 million. In the Fragrance category, revenues were up 5% at $545 million. Hair Care sales totaled $164 million, up 5%.Regional ResultsSales in the Americas remained flat year over year at $1,071 million. Revenues in the EMEA region declined 15% to $1,253 million. In the Asia-Pacific region, sales surged 29% to $1,302 million.Other UpdatesThe company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4,029 million, long-term debt of $7,117 million and total equity of $5,585 million.Net cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal 2023 was $1,731 million, and capital expenditures amounted to $1 billion. The company returned $1.2 billion in cash to shareholders through dividend payouts and share repurchases during the fiscal. In fiscal 2024, net cash provided by operating activities is likely to be $1.7-$1.8 billion. Capital expenditures are expected to be about 6% of the forecasted sales.In a separate press release, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 66 cents per share on Class A and Class B shares. The dividend will be paid out on Sep 15, 2023 to shareholders of record as of Aug 31. Management expects to maintain its quarterly dividend payout at the current level in fiscal 2024, while it announced the suspension of its share buyback plan.On Apr 28, 2023, Estee Lauder concluded the buyout of the TOM FORD brand for about $2.28 billion.GuidanceManagement remains focused on speeding up growth across regions, brands, product categories and channels as it enters fiscal 2024. EL expects to revert to organic net sales growth and witness progressive margin recovery in fiscal 2024. The company is focused on fueling momentum in regions that are performing well, alongside re-accelerating North America growth. It is also taking actions to improve the Asia travel retail business.Moving on, Estee Lauder plans to make continued strategic investments, such as innovation, speeding up retail growth in Asia travel retail, advertising, growth in emerging markets and concluding its first manufacturing facility in Asia. These are likely to help support business recovery and fuel share gains.That said, management remains cautious about economic hurdles in China, volatile inflation levels, foreign currency fluctuations and concerns surrounding recession (in several global markets).For fiscal 2024, management projects net sales to increase 3-5% year over year, including an unfavorable currency impact of 1%. The view includes anticipations of sequential improvements in quarterly net sales growth. Organic net sales growth is anticipated in the range of 6-8%.Management envisions gross margin expansion in fiscal 2024, backed by prudent price hikes, lower discounts and reduced obsolescence charges. The gross margin is likely to contract in the first half of fiscal 2024, which is expected to be more than offset by expansion in the second half.Further, management expects a sequential improvement in the operating margin throughout fiscal 2024, with higher growth in the second half. This can be accountable to the pace of improvement in the travel retail business in Asia.Adjusted EPS, excluding restructuring and other charges, is expected in the band of $3.50-$3.75, suggesting growth from $3.46 reported in fiscal 2023. Currency headwinds are likely to affect net EPS by nearly 11 cents. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 4-12% at cc.For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Estee Lauder anticipates reported and organic net sales to decline 12%-10% year over year.

116,7d0ac692-1b56-38fa-b975-50415f840cda,PG,2023-08-21,REFILE-EXPLAINER-Can Thailand's Pheu Thai Party form a coalition government?,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/refile-explainer-thailands-pheu-thai-094510363.html,1692611110,STORY,['PG'],"[(Corrects spelling of Procter &amp; Gamble in 3rd paragraph)By Martin PettyBANGKOK, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Thailand's Pheu Thai Party will attempt to form a government on Tuesday after weeks of post-election deadlock, with real estate tycoon Srettha Thavisin set to be nominated as prime minister and face a vote in parliament.WHO IS SRETTHA?Srettha, 60, is an outsider and political neophyte little known beyond Thailand. He joined the populist Pheu Thai in 2022 and up until the May 14 election was president of property developer Sansiri. He is not a member of parliament.The six feet, 3 inch (1.92 m) tall Srettha is a finance graduate from the Claremont Graduate School in the United States who once worked for Procter &amp; Gamble in Thailand.Though he has no experience in government, his political ascent has been largely welcomed by businesses and he is untainted by the bitter power struggles that have dogged Thai politics for nearly two decades.WHY IS HE BEING NOMINATED FOR PM?Pheu Thai came a close second in the election but its pact with the winner, the progressive Move Forward, fell through after that party's prime ministerial candidate Pita Limjaroenrat failed to win support from lawmakers allied with the royalist military. Pheu Thai is now leading the effort to form a government.The billionaire Shinawatra family that founded Pheu Thai has a long and bitter history with the military, which ousted the governments of Thaksin Shinawatra and his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, in 2006 and 2014 respectively.Thaksin's youngest daughter, Paetongtarn, was another possible candidate for prime minister. But to Pheu Thai's rivals, newcomer Srettha could be a more palatable compromise than having another Shinawatra at the helm.DOES SRETTHA HAVE PARLIAMENT'S BACKING?Fourteen parties have pledged support for Srettha and Pheu Thai in the lower house, but the biggest stumbling block will be the upper house Senate, whose 249 members were appointed by the generals who toppled Pheu Thai's last government.Story continuesThe military created the rules under which a prime minister is selected, with the Senate essentially protecting establishment interests by serving as a bulwark against elected progressive politicians.The Senate's largely conservative members were instrumental in ensuring Move Forward's Pita failed and it is unclear how many will see Srettha and Pheu Thai as a better option.Srettha needs 375 votes, or more than half of the combined lower and upper houses. Pheu Thai's alliance has 11 parties with a combined 314 seats, and three more lower-house lawmakers backing it, so it needs the votes of 58 Senators.WHAT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME?The military-backed United Thai Nation and Palang Pracharat parties that were instrumental in thwarting Move Forward have joined the alliance backing Srettha.But scepticism remains about how firm that support is, given the army's years-long efforts to undermine Pheu Thai. To have such backing from its enemies indicates some kind of once unthinkable power-sharing agreement may have been made behind the scenes.That would boost Srettha's chances of winning the backing of Senators allied with the army.However, given the fraught history, there will be doubts about the effectiveness of such a coalition, how long a Pheu Thai-led government might last, and whether the military and allies in key institutions might try to push Pheu Thai out later.An opinion poll published on the weekend showed many Thais were not happy with the idea of a Pheu Thai-military pact.WHAT ROLE IS THAKSIN SHINAWATRA PLAYING?Officially, none, but as the self-exiled figurehead of the Pheu Thai political juggernaut, it is almost certain Thaksin would have been involved in any deal made between rival camps.Thaksin, 74, is a fugitive in Thailand and plans to return on Tuesday, the same day as the vote, after 17 years abroad dodging jail sentences handed down in absentia for abuse of power and more.The change of heart suggests Thaksin is confident the vote will go in Pheu Thai's way and any deal he has with old enemies will hold - including over his incarceration - despite the history of mistrust and betrayal. Some people in Thailand, however, are sceptical about Thaksin's promised homecoming and see it as political theatre. (Editing by Robert Birsel)]"

To skip our detailed analysis of generative AI and its application in the field of investing, you can go directly to see the 5 Stocks ChatGPT Said Will Make Me Rich in 10 Years.Using Artificial Intelligence To InvestThe markets have been talking about artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, all year. Companies across a wide range of industries and sectors are attempting to introduce their own AI-driven products and services so as not to be left in the dust by their competitors. At the same time, every investor is trying to get into the artificial intelligence trade today. Individual investors and hedge funds alike are putting their manpower into picking out the best AI stocks for the rest of the year as we head into the second half of 2023. Interestingly enough, at this point, it's not just manpower that's going into picking stocks. Some investors and hedge funds are actually trying to harness the power of AI to pick stocks instead of leaving the job to human beings. This trend really gets you thinking about how successful an AI software might be at helping an investor build up their portfolio. Is it a strategy that might lead to mind-blowing results or one that will lead you to ruin?On August 3, CNBC invited Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, to talk about just this. CNBC's Bob Pisani noted that AI-driven exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been around for a while and are starting to come up more this year. Pisani thus invited Rosenbluth to share some of his insights on these ETFs and how effective they are. According to Rosenbluth, a lot more AI-driven ETFs have been working on picking stocks recently. Here's what he had to say about this development:""It's perhaps a smarter way of picking stocks. I know that computers can be smarter than I know I am, [it's] whether or not they're going to be better at outperforming the broader S&amp;P 500. There's no emotion behind it.""Story continuesIs Generative AI Really Helpful For Investors?The discussion surrounding artificial intelligence, in general, and in the world of investing, has been extremely interesting because of the immense potential of this technology when it comes to changing the way people live, work, and even invest. It makes you wonder how not only AI-driven ETFs but also AI chatbots can contribute to the investing world today. This May, CNN reported that a dummy portfolio of 38 stocks recommended by OpenAI's viral chatbot, ChatGPT, actually managed to outperform major investment funds in the United Kingdom, for instance. This portfolio managed to gain about 4.9% between March 6 and April 28, while the 10 leading investment funds of the country reported an average loss of about 0.8%. During the same period, the S&amp;P 500 rose by 3%. The result of this experiment is merely one example of the sheer potential vested in artificial intelligence when it comes to investing.Our Stock-Picking Experiment with ChatGPTConsidering these developments, we also attempted to get a list of stocks from ChatGPT this March. We first prompted the AI chatbot to present itself as a professional investment advisor and then asked it to present a list of 10 stocks it thinks will make us rich in the next 10 years. ChatGPT then proceeded to give us a diversified list of stocks, ranging from tech names and consumer staples to financials and healthcare. Some of the most notable names on its list included Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), all big names in the tech and AI sectors this year.Today we will be revisiting this list of stocks to see how each of these companies has performed over the period between March and August and check if ChatGPT really was right in recommending these names. By doing this, we will see if these really can be considered stocks that will make you rich in 2023 and beyond.10 Stocks ChatGPT Said Will Make Me Rich in 10 YearsOur MethodologyIn March 2023 we asked ChatGPT to act like an expert stock picker and recommend some stocks that could make us rich in 10 years.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks Yielding at Least 7% According to Hedge Funds. Currently, the stock market is in an unpredictable phase, and experts hold varying opinions about the country’s economic outlook. According to a report by Forbes, the New York Fed's indicator suggests a 66% likelihood of a U.S. recession within the next year. In addition to this, the Federal Reserve has repeatedly warned that its ongoing practice of interest rate increases will lead to a slowdown in economic growth. On the other hand, the University of Michigan reported that consumer confidence in the U.S. rose by 13% in July as compared to last year, reaching its highest point since 2021. This indicates that consumers are likely to continue spending actively.Regardless of the situation, experts always advise investors to prepare for potential challenges by creating portfolios that can withstand unfavorable economic situations. Including dividend stocks in a portfolio can be a strategy to navigate negative market sentiment. In the past, these equities have often performed better than other types of stocks during economic downturns. In addition to this, these companies have sound financial health and improved cash flow, allowing them to distribute dividends to their shareholders.In Morningstar’s August report, David Harrell, an editorial director at the financial services firm, advises investors to examine a company's past track record in various economic situations, particularly whether it managed to maintain dividend payments during economic downturns or industry-related challenges. Some of the best dividend stocks in this regard are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). These companies have a solid track record of increasing their dividends over time, which makes investors feel confident about them.Story continuesAlso read: 10 Dividend Stocks with Over 8% YieldOver the years, dividends have represented a significant portion of the market’s overall return. The MSCI Value Index, which tracks the performance of stocks that are considered undervalued or trading at lower prices relative to their fundamentals, returned 303% in the last 25 years, with dividends contributing 72% to the total return during this period. The index methodology considers factors like book value, price-to-earnings ratio, and dividend yield to select and weight the stocks within the index.Dividend yields play a significant role when investing in dividend stocks because healthy yields can bring investors profits from their investments.

Horton, Inc.'s (NYSE:DHI) Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robust-financials-driving-recent-rally-110030131.html,1692615630,STORY,['DHI'],"[D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 11% over the last three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study D.R. Horton's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for D.R. Horton How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for D.R. Horton is:22% = US$4.9b ÷ US$22b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.22 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of D.R. Horton's Earnings Growth And 22% ROEFirst thing first, we like that D.R. Horton has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 18% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, D.R. Horton's considerable five year net income growth of 31% was to be expected.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between D.R. Horton's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 31% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about D.R. Horton's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is D.R. Horton Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?D.R. Horton's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 6.9% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (93%) of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Besides, D.R. Horton has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 9.4% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 17%) over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with D.R. Horton's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

His formidable stock-picking ability has given him the nickname ‘the Oracle of Omaha’ and a fortune of ~$117 billion, making him one of the richest people in the world. His firm, Berkshire Hathaway, is also counted among the most successful, boasting total assets of over $1 trillion.So obviously when Buffett goes shopping, investors are keen to find out what’s in the bag. During Q2, Buffett opened new positions in a few homebuilding stocks, and as he is known for his value investing style, he must think these names offer just that right now.But it’s not just Buffett who likes the look of these particular equities. Raymond James analyst Buck Horne has also pinpointed an opportunity in these stocks, believing they are primed to deliver double-digit growth over the next year.For a fuller view of their prospects, we decided to run these tickers through the TipRanks database. Here’s what we found.D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI)The first stock Buffett is betting on is D.R. Horton, a Texas-based construction firm and a leader in the US homebuilding industry. The company has held the title of the ‘nation’s largest homebuilder’ for more than 20 years and operates in 113 residential markets across 33 states. D.R. Horton works on projects for both single-family homes and multi-family apartment complexes.D.R. Horton has been building homes for 45 years, and has closed over 1 million building contracts in that time. The company has a portfolio of designs, featuring homes in all price brackets, from under $200,000 to over $1 million, and can even implement smart home technology from ground up during construction.While the company holds a leading position in its industry, it has felt the effects of real estate headwinds. Earnings are down year-over-year for the past several quarters, even as revenues have showed y/y gains. This pattern continued in the recently reported results for Q3 of fiscal 2023. DHI had a top line of $9.7 billion, up 11% from the year-ago quarter, but the bottom line non-GAAP EPS of $3.90 was well below the 3Q22 figure of $4.67. That said, of greater import for investors, DHI beat the forecasts at both the top and bottom lines in Q3, with revenue coming in $1.31 billion above expectations and EPS beating by $1.07 per share.Story continuesLooking forward, DHI reported two important metrics that bode well for future business. First, it closed on 22,985 homes in Q3, a year-over-year increase of 8%, and the total value of those homes closures was up 4% y/y, to $8.7 billion. And, the company’s net sales orders were up an impressive 37% y/y, to 22,879 homes. The total value of the net sales orders was reported as $8.7 billion, for a 26% y/y increase. As such, the company raised its revenue outlook for the year, with the top-line now expected to hit the range between $34.7 billion to $35.1 billion compared to $31.5-$33 billion beforehand. Consensus had $32.34 billion.As for Warren Buffett, his firm opened a new position in DHI during the calendar second quarter. Berkshire Hathaway disclosed total purchases of 5,969,714 shares of DHI, a major stock acquisition that is now worth about $700 million.Turning to the Raymond James view, we find that analyst Buck Horne is impressed with D.R. Horton’s prospects for the next few quarters. He writes, “As it stands, we now see DHI on a path toward double-digit EPS growth and 20%+ ROIC metrics in FY24, most notably supported by a surging rental housing platform – which we think will significantly mitigate cyclical volatility associated with mortgage rates. With its pristine balance sheet primed for growth and acquisition opportunities, we believe DHI’s earnings visibility and profitability have improved to the point that investors should not be afraid of current valuations.”Alongside these comments, Home gives DHI shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, with a price target of $160 that implies a one-year upside potential of ~36%. (To watch Home’s track record, click here)Overall, DHI has picked up 15 recent Wall Street analyst reviews, and these include 10 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell to give the stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are selling for $117.31 and the $144 average price target implies ~23% upside on the one-year horizon. (See DHI stock forecast)Lennar Corporation (LEN)The next Buffett choice we’re looking at is Florida-based Lennar Corp, another of the major homebuilders in the US. Lennar operates on the East Coast and Southeast, in the Great Lakes region, in Texas and Oklahoma, and in the West and West Coast regions. The company is perennially among the top 5 largest homebuilders in the country, counting by total home sales. Since its founding in 1954, Lennar has built more than 1 million homes.The company controls a number of brands, that offer services in all aspects of the new-home industry. There are five brands operating on the construction side, while Lennar Mortgage, Lennar Title, and Lennar Insurance Agency provide the necessary financial services to make the homes available to buyers. Lennar has a long history of expanding its operations through acquisition, and currently works in 26 states.In 2022, Lennar reported more than $33 billion in total revenues, but the company is not quite on track so far this year to meet that figure. In its 2Q23 report, Lennar showed a top line of $8.05 billion, down 3.7% y/y, although it should be noted that was some $810 million above the estimates. The company’s Q2 earnings, an EPS of $2.94 by non-GAAP measures, also beat the forecast – by 62 cents per share.Lennar delivered 17,074 homes in Q2, and finished the quarter with new orders for 17,885 homes – worth a total of $8.2 billion. The company’s work backlog, an important metric for future business, was reported at 20,214 homes, valued at $9.5 billion.Reflecting a new position for Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, the firm pulled the trigger on 152,572 shares in Q2. This stake in Lennar is currently valued at $17.85 million.Also bullish on this stock, Raymond James’ Buck Horne is impressed by Lennar’s ability to maintain production.“Combining targeted price reductions, incentives, and mortgage rate buydowns to keep home production flowing, despite mortgage rate volatility, Lennar has been able to identify the remarkable reservoir of pent-up housing demand much sooner than most… We find shares of LEN trading at 1.7x trailing book value and 9.5x our FY24 EPS, roughly in line with peer averages. As such, we think LEN shares remain worthy of a material valuation re-rating thanks to a 15%+ projected ROIC, double-digit EPS growth, and a net debt free balance sheet,” Horne opined.Quantifying his stance, Horne goes on to rate LEN an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and he puts a $150 price target on the stock to show his confidence in a 28% gain on the 12-month horizon.All in all, Lennar has picked up 16 recent analyst reviews, and these include 10 Buys, 4 Holds, and 2 Sells to give the stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $134.40 and the current trading price of $117 together point toward ~15% one-year upside potential.
